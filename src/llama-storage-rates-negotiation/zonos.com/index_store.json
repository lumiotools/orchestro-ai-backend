international shipping carrier\nMake informed decisions for your business based on several factors.For ecommerce businesses shipping internationally, selecting the right carrier is essential for streamlining operations, reducing costs, and ensuring customer satisfaction.The size of a business can play a significant role in this decision—larger companies may be able to negotiate better rates or handle multiple carriers.In contrast, smaller businesses need to prioritize cost-effective solutions.Each country comes with its own set of shipping challenges, making it vital to select carriers that suit a business's needs in terms of speed, service, and cost.Often, this means using more than one carrier for different regions or order types.This guide covers everything you need to make informed decisions across four key areas:\nFactors to consider when selecting carriers\nTypes of international shipping carriers\nInternational carrier options for small businesses\nInternational carrier options for large/enterprise businesses\nFactors to consider \nWhen choosing international carriers, it's essential to look beyond the basic costs.Each carrier offers different options, from shipping speed and customer choice to tracking capabilities and reliability.Considering these factors will help create a shipping strategy that aligns with your customers' expectations while managing costs effectively.Below are the key factors to keep in mind when evaluating carrier options.Choice: Ensure customers have multiple shipping options\nProviding a range of shipping options at checkout can enhance the customer experience and boost conversion rates.When shoppers see only one shipping option, they face a yes-or-no decision.Offering two or three options gives them more flexibility and increases the likelihood they'll complete their purchase.Three types of shipping to offer:\nEconomy Shipping\nStandard Shipping\nExpress Shipping\nSpeed: Meeting customer expectations\nShipping speed is a significant driver of customer satisfaction.While some customers are willing to wait for a lower-cost option, others prioritize speed and will pay for faster delivery.Offering a range of shipping speeds—from express to economy—helps ensure the needs of various customer segments.Cost: Aim to offer customers the lowest shipping costs\nShipping costs can make up a significant portion of a shopper's total order value, so it's important to negotiate rates with carriers where possible.Additionally, consider potential hidden costs like demand surcharges, oversize surcharges, and additional handling surcharges.Be aware of each carrier's options for duty and tax payment (e.g., bill sender, bill third party, bill consignee), and choose one that aligns with a business's pricing strategy.Additional considerations: Tracking, reliability, and insurance\nBusinesses should consider additional factors like tracking services, reliability, and insurance to optimize the shipping strategy further, especially for businesses that ship high-value goods.Types of carriers \nWhen shipping internationally, merchants have a choice of carriers and service levels, each with unique advantages and challenges.Understanding these types is crucial for selecting the right partners that align with your business's needs, whether cost, speed, or reliability.Below, we outline the main types of international shipping carriers and their characteristics to help you make an informed choice.Postal services\nIntegrators/express carriers\nConsolidators\nResellers\nThird-party logistics providers (3PLs)\nRegional carriers\nVolume-based carrier options \nWith an understanding of the different carrier types you can explore tailored options for your business based on your shipping volume.Options for small to medium businesses\nOptions for large/enterprise businesses\nSummary \nWhether a small business is shipping just a few international packages each month or a large enterprise handling hundreds of shipments daily, aligning carrier choices with shipping volume and needs is key to optimizing an international shipping strategy.Low volume: Use postal services for affordability.Moderate volume: Use resellers or third-party logistics providers to access better rates.High volume: Negotiate directly with express carriers and explore consolidator services or local fulfillment options.As a business grows, it should regularly re-evaluate its carrier strategy to stay aligned with changing customer expectations, new shipping destinations, and evolving market conditions.This ongoing assessment helps ensure that businesses continue offering their customers the best options while effectively managing costs.By aligning carrier strategies with business needs, companies can navigate the complexities of international shipping with greater confidence and success.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"T51m0a5a9A0SinayG8Kng5BHX7W2pMX1xw6wrvbtGPg="},"4f3a2162-fc9f-416f-9d87-88b06356718b":{"id_":"4f3a2162-fc9f-416f-9d87-88b06356718b","metadata":{"url":"https://zonos.com/docs/guides/selecting-an-international-shipping-carrier"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"29eca184-d688-4e98-9656-8bf36707d1ca","metadata":{"url":"https://zonos.com/docs/guides/selecting-an-international-shipping-carrier"},"hash":"sf8tZ9Gi2p7jiNSGdZDpD9JcfbT3nQRXIL98oSpFQHQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"95b12bff-4f58-4311-9e5f-08b061b5e355","metadata":{"url":"https://zonos.com/docs/guides/selecting-an-international-shipping-carrier"},"hash":"T51m0a5a9A0SinayG8Kng5BHX7W2pMX1xw6wrvbtGPg="}},"text":"Options

To control shipping costs, surface fees at checkout and send shipments DDP (Delivery Duty Paid). This means duties and taxes are billed to you or a third party like Zonos, allowing for negotiation and potential cost reduction. It's often cheaper than DDU (Delivery Duty Unpaid). While not all fees are easy to negotiate, services like Zonos can offer discounted fees with carriers. We have negotiated benefits with all major express carriers.
