not its weight!As a result, shippers sending small packages can save money.Shipping heavy items  \nIf you’re shipping heavier and larger items (like furniture or heavy home decor) - UPS is often cheapest.Also, UPS offers additional shipping insurance for up to $50,000 declared value.What does that have to do with saving money on shipping costs?Well, 1 out of every 10 items shipped in the US are damaged.So eventually, something will happen to one of your packages.And if you’re sending high-value items like furniture, you stand to lose a lot.With UPS extra insurance, you can be sure that the costs are covered should anything happen.2.Go for ground shipping services \nIn the age of Amazon, it can be tempting to choose expedited shipping.But these shipping services are costly.Instead, go for inexpensive carrier ground services.Yes, ground shipping is a little slower.However, it’s a lot cheaper than Next or 2nd Day Air.Plus, delivery services like USPS Priority Mail only take 1.8 days on average.Therefore, your customers won’t have to wait that much longer to receive their package.As an added bonus, ground services use considerably less fuel.So your small business can save money on shipping and be sustainable at the same time.3.Ship multiple orders in one package\nThe same customer places 5 different orders from your eCommerce store.Then, you print 5 separate labels and ship out 5 separate packages.Don’t worry - we’ve all done it.But it’s not cost-effective and it’s not great for the environment either.So, the next time a customer places multiple orders, ship them all in one package and print one label.This way, you’ll avoid spending money on extra packaging and shipping labels that you don’t need.As a consequence of consolidating your orders, you’ll also be practicing eco-friendly shipping.Less packaging = less waste and less weight on the truck!How do you print one shipping label for multiple orders?With the Ship.com shipping platform, the merge order function makes it easy to combine multiple shipments into one label.In fact, it only takes a few clicks!4.Apply lightweight packaging practices\nThis one is really simple.If you want to reduce your small business shipping costs - apply lightweight packing practices.Try to use the smallest box and as little packing material as possible.Of course, you want your package to be secure.But extra packaging and in-filler means additional weight.And the heavier the shipment, the more expensive it is to send.Bigger boxes also have a larger dimensional weight.Ultimately, a greater dim weight will add more $ to the final cost.In addition to this, custom packaging is a great way to minimize the overall weight of your package.By using a package that snugly fits your items, you’ll avoid the expense of extra dimensional weight.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"p1rc8tja8NQKl0fjSbL7yJe1A5OLcYU8pJ86jTK91yk="},"498ad274-2b5d-4965-9f8a-fd121f44ee74":{"id_":"498ad274-2b5d-4965-9f8a-fd121f44ee74","metadata":{"url":"https://www.arka.com/blogs/news/how-to-reduce-your-small-business-shipping-costs?srsltid=AfmBOoqyq1yjZRr9NVtqHGEHgDKcnXz7E8cP3-JSwy_H7lMQH6_kkHai"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e901e88c-15b1-46d2-a53a-f5062128d971","metadata":{"url":"https://www.arka.com/blogs/news/how-to-reduce-your-small-business-shipping-costs?srsltid=AfmBOoqyq1yjZRr9NVtqHGEHgDKcnXz7E8cP3-JSwy_H7lMQH6_kkHai"},"hash":"YUxuHvHWmy7uHUpTUsdxfOZ+zMQ+hSjDe0qyYZeGvuA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bc77bdea-ddab-4835-bcf6-9206010b58ca","metadata":{"url":"https://www.arka.com/blogs/news/how-to-reduce-your-small-business-shipping-costs?srsltid=AfmBOoqyq1yjZRr9NVtqHGEHgDKcnXz7E8cP3-JSwy_H7lMQH6_kkHai"},"hash":"p1rc8tja8NQKl0fjSbL7yJe1A5OLcYU8pJ86jTK91yk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0526dbbf-fc86-4e4d-88a2-d9cab6a93859","metadata":{},"hash":"Dgry6n5CmE0s80kAoDgoXbCw9usCl6WhfSXdxotMEME="}},"text":"How do you print one shipping label for multiple orders?With the Ship.com shipping platform, the merge order function makes it easy to combine multiple shipments into one label.In fact, it only takes a few clicks!4.Apply lightweight packaging practices\nThis one is really simple.If you want to reduce your small business shipping costs - apply lightweight packing practices.Try to use the smallest box and as little packing material as possible.Of course, you want your package to be secure.But extra packaging and in-filler means additional weight.And the heavier the shipment, the more expensive it is to send.Bigger boxes also have a larger dimensional weight.Ultimately, a greater dim weight will add more $ to the final cost.In addition to this, custom packaging is a great way to minimize the overall weight of your package.By using a package that snugly fits your items, you’ll avoid the expense of extra dimensional weight.Plus, because the box is the exact right fit, you won’t have to fill it with packing materials.As a result, you’ll lessen the weight and the cost.5.Opt for locally manufactured packaging\nWhen you’re just looking at Cost Per Unit, purchasing packaging materials from abroad can look cheaper.However, looks can be deceiving.There are tons of extra costs that come with ordering shipping supplies from overseas.This includes shipping, import fees, and much more.When you factor in all these additional fees, it’s actually very expensive to get your provisions from outside the US.So save yourself money and source supplies from a local manufacturer.6.Order free shipping supplies \nWant to know what’s better than cheap shipping supplies?Free ones.And you can pick up materials from multiple well-known carriers at no cost.Or even get them delivered to your door.A wide range of free boxes and envelopes are available to order at the USPS store online.Generally, materials are delivered in boxes of 10 or 25.Alternatively, if your post office is nearby, you can drop in to pick up your provisions there.Other carriers like UPS also offer free supplies, including packaging, labels, and forms.7.Know when to use flat-rate shipping\nAnother great way to minimize your small business shipping costs - take advantage of flat-rate shipping.Now, there are times when flat-rate shipping will save you money and times when it will be more expensive.So, it's important to know when to use it.Flat-rate shipping gives a single rate based on a package's size rather than weight.Therefore, if you’re shipping small but heavy items, you can use a smaller package and save money.It’s also a good idea to capitalize on flat rates if you’re shipping long distances.Usually, the further away you ship, the higher the cost.But flat-rate shipping enables you to ship long distances for one rate.Ultimately, this rate can work out cheaper vs. your carriers’ other services.8.Trade boxes for poly mailers\n  If your eCommerce business sells small items like clothing - ditch boxes and switch to Poly-Mailers to save money on shipping.By using Poly-Mailers, you can minimize the size of your packaging.And you’ll avoid charges for extra dimensional weight as a result.Plus, because Poly-Mailers are so compact, you’ll need less in-filler and packing material to protect and seal your item.Consequently, this will bring down the packages actual weight, as well as the shipping cost.9.Arrange home pick ups\nMost home business owners wouldn’t think of their gas usage as a shipping expense.Yet, if you’re making daily trips to the post-office to drop off shipments - it is.In fact, lengthy trips to the post-office multiple times a day can be pretty costly.However, there’s an easy way to avoid doing this.Free USPS home pick-ups.Not only can home pick-ups save you a ton of money on gas, but they’re also way more time efficient.And they’re easy to arrange.Using Ship.com, you can schedule a home pick-up in just 2-clicks!10.Save money on shipping labels with big discounts at ship.com\nFinally, an excellent way to save your small business money on shipping is to use shipping software.Platforms like Ship.com receive huge discounts on shipping labels with major carriers.Last year, Ship.com saved small business owners $1.9m on shipping expenses.Users of the platform can access up to 78% off UPS Ground® and up to 84% off USPS labels.As well as up to 73% off UPS 2nd Day Air® and UPS Next Day Air® services.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"UOT7ooaOfumzLSSKaMSCgzSJv906TKLXXLSH0aRboeI="},"0526dbbf-fc86-4e4d-88a2-d9cab6a93859":{"id_":"0526dbbf-fc86-4e4d-88a2-d9cab6a93859","metadata":{"url":"https://www.arka.com/blogs/news/how-to-reduce-your-small-business-shipping-costs?srsltid=AfmBOoqyq1yjZRr9NVtqHGEHgDKcnXz7E8cP3-JSwy_H7lMQH6_kkHai"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e901e88c-15b1-46d2-a53a-f5062128d971","metadata":{"url":"https://www.arka.com/blogs/news/how-to-reduce-your-small-business-shipping-costs?srsltid=AfmBOoqyq1yjZRr9NVtqHGEHgDKcnXz7E8cP3-JSwy_H7lMQH6_kkHai"},"hash":"YUxuHvHWmy7uHUpTUsdxfOZ+zMQ+hSjDe0qyYZeGvuA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"498ad274-2b5d-4965-9f8a-fd121f44ee74","metadata":{"url":"https://www.arka.com/blogs/news/how-to-reduce-your-small-business-shipping-costs?srsltid=AfmBOoqyq1yjZRr9NVtqHGEHgDKcnXz7E8cP3-JSwy_H7lMQH6_kkHai"},"hash":"1SnqIL+pmV3d+t/kO5+xGn0CsMh85S7wHE09Aqq0VtU="}},"text":"However, there’s an easy way to avoid doing this.Free USPS home pick-ups.Not only can home pick-ups save you a ton of money on gas, but they’re also way more time efficient.And they’re easy to arrange.Using Ship.com, you can schedule a home pick-up in just 2-clicks!10.Save money on shipping labels with big discounts at ship.com\nFinally, an excellent way to save your small business money on shipping is to use shipping software.Platforms like Ship.com receive huge discounts on shipping labels with major carriers.Last year, Ship.com saved small business owners $1.9m on shipping expenses.Users of the platform can access up to 78% off UPS Ground® and up to 84% off USPS labels.As well as up to 73% off UPS 2nd Day Air® and UPS Next Day Air® services.So taking advantage of these discounts can drastically cut your shipping expenses.Conclusion: There are several ways to reduce the impact of soaring small business shipping costs.Shipping is expensive -

optimizing shipping costs\nCalculating shipping costs will help you choose a shipping strategy and decide at what price to sell the products.In addition, when you clearly see how much you spend, you can find ways to cut your spendings and optimize your expenses.Table of contents\nFactors affecting the shipping cost\nCalculating shipping costs\nCalculating shipping costs by example\nOptimizing shipping costs\nFactors affecting the shipping cost\nDifferent factors can affect the actual cost of sending your products to the buyer, such as:\nPackage weight and dimensions.Shipping carriers like USPS, FedEx, and UPS calculate shipping charges based on the actual weight of the package or its dimensional weight.Shipping destination.Your shipping costs will be higher if you offer international shipping in your store.Value of shipped products.If you sell high-value products you may want to insure their shipment which will increase shipping costs.Delivery times.Some buyers prefer to pay for expedited shipping; this cost is based on where the buyer is located.Calculating shipping costs\nIf you want to use custom rates or compensate for free shipping, you need to calculate your shipping costs to learn how much to charge customers.Knowing your shipping costs is also helpful if you want to charge customers for any extra spendings that are not included in real-time rates (e.g., luxury or handmade package).Shipping costs are based on your products’ dimensions, your shipping destinations, and carrier’s rates.If you deliver yourself, your main costs will be on gas, driver salary, insurance and vehicle maintenance.Shipping with carriers or delivery services\nPackage weight and size.As a general rule of thumb, the smaller and lighter a package is, the less it will cost to ship.That’s why it’s important to choose a box that’s big enough for your products, but not so big that it increases your package’s dim weight needlessly.Remember that carriers calculate the total weight of the package and not the weight of the product itself.Destination.The farther your destination is, the more you’ll pay for shipment.This is true whether you’re shipping domestically or internationally.Considering this, you may want to start with local delivery if you are only beginning with online selling.Delivery time.Carriers usually offer a range of standard and express service times.Express delivery takes 1 day, standard delivery takes 2-3 business days.The faster delivery or shipping is, the more expensive it will be for you.If you use real-time rates in Ecwid, you can choose whether to offer customers express or standard delivery methods.Taxes.Keep in mind that international shipments may also be subject to taxes and duties that need to be paid separately.To find out which charges apply to your shipment, consult with your carrier or the customs authorities of the country you’re shipping to.Outstanding packaging.If you want to create a splendid experience with your product, you might use a handmade or luxury package for your products.To calculate packaging costs, divide the total amount you spent on packaging by the number of goods that can be packaged with it.To optimize your shipping costs, you can compare rates from different shipping services and choose the most affordable.Here’s the list of online shipping rates calculator for:\nFedEx\nUPS\nUSPS\nRoyal Mail\nCanada Post\nAustralia Post\nYou can calculate the shipping costs for one package or add up shipping costs for a week/month and then divide it by the number of deliveries made during the time period.That will be your average delivery cost for one order.Delivering yourself\nGas.Your fuel expenses will fluctuate depending on how busy your delivery drivers are, and how well your routes are planned.Labor.You must pay a salary to each courier you hire.If you are not sure how much to pay, look up this average pizza delivery driver wages by state table.Vehicle maintenance.It can be a rental cost if you rent a vehicle, or price for a service that is required for your car or bike when they are not functioning properly.Insurance.When offering delivery, you need insurance for general liability coverage and driver commercial coverage.Packaging.This includes the box or envelope to pack items and packaging materials.Find out how much you’re spending weekly or monthly and divide this by the number of deliveries made during the time period.That will be your average delivery cost for one order.Once you get to know your shipping costs, you can add custom rates to your Ecwid store, add a handling fee for each order, or compensate free shipping by higher prices.If you need to calculate shipping costs based on a specific flexible logic tailored to your business, you can hire the Ecwid Ecommerce development team to create a solution for you.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Bt/l2qMBXdUV5fRxwK473TLjsP4OVO7m/suIgoKgfiQ="},"0adf65a4-c116-4bbf-aaec-b9f5ec6fc4bb":{"id_":"0adf65a4-c116-4bbf-aaec-b9f5ec6fc4bb","metadata":{"url":"https://support.ecwid.com/hc/en-us/articles/5286844448412-Calculating-and-optimizing-shipping-costs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"52fdf479-cae6-41ab-a683-b4e7f19debb7","metadata":{"url":"https://support.ecwid.com/hc/en-us/articles/5286844448412-Calculating-and-optimizing-shipping-costs"},"hash":"MSeTT2UOIfMN1lhif2IrYQEgdau0SaLWRHRKslUWJC8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a816d092-abbc-47ac-b3e4-629f1df32b41","metadata":{"url":"https://support.ecwid.com/hc/en-us/articles/5286844448412-Calculating-and-optimizing-shipping-costs"},"hash":"Bt/l2qMBXdUV5fRxwK473TLjsP4OVO7m/suIgoKgfiQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cb9b1a89-9b20-466f-b0a0-bd29ddb2854b","metadata":{},"hash":"py2zm8D0Xnf21p2R/x46eS6ESLUtyHcyfTDhRACFRnM="}},"text":"If

exact shipping costs.Sara chose small boxes to fit her rings and pendants and then looked up on the USPS site how much it will cost to ship small boxes to different states:\nProduct cost: $30.00\nShipping fee: $15.00\nPackaging cost: $0.75\nCredit card processing: $0.85\nTotal cost: $46.60.To make a profit of roughly 30% for each product, Sara should sell it at $60 (before taxes).If your margin is high, you may want to absorb the costs of shipping domestic orders and offer free shipping to your local customers.To compensate for shipping expenses, you can slightly increase product prices in your online store.Alternatively, you can choose to charge your customers the exact amount that you pay for getting their order shipped.You can use online calculators to check how much shipping carriers charge to ship products of different weights and dimensions to different destinations from your location:\nUPS rates calculator,\nUSPS rates calculator,\nFedEx rates calculator, etc.\nIf you’ve just started your online business and sell locally, you can offer a local pickup, or deliver the ordered goods yourself.You can also use simple packaging for orders and hand-write shipping labels to reduce expenses at the start.If you’ve been in the market for quite some time and sell many products, it might be cost-effective for you to use third-party logistics (3PL) like eFulfillment Service in order to outsource warehousing, packing, and shipping your products.While your business is growing, review your shipping strategy from time to time and make any necessary adjustments.Optimizing shipping costs\nUndercharging your customers for shipping can eat into your profit if you absorb the costs yourself, while overcharging customers for shipping can lead to abandoned carts and lost sales.Here are some tips on how you can optimize your shipping costs and, in turn, charge your customers accurate or even lower rates when possible:\nPack as small & as light as possible.Shipping companies charge by size and weight (unless you’ve opted for flat-rate shipping).To reduce shipping costs, use as little packaging material as is safe for your items.When possible, switch from boxes to poly mailers if you sell small non-fragile items like clothes or use bubble mailers if your products need some protection.To help you save, we offer a promo code ecwid15

discounted shipping rates.If you ship often or expect high-volume shipments, you can negotiate lower rates with carriers.Discuss the possible discounted pricing with your carrier to make sure you’re getting the best pricing for your online business.Stick to fewer carriers to have a good volume of shipments with them and thus maximize your bargaining power.Pay for shipping online.You can have additional cost savings by paying for shipping online.If you are located in the US, Germany, Belgium, or Netherlands, you can purchase and print shipping labels right from your Ecwid admin.Get third-party insurance.If you sell high-value items, you are likely to need shipping insurance to get reimbursed for shipments that are lost, stolen, or damaged in transit with a courier.Third-party insurers usually charge less than carriers, which can bring you significant savings if you frequently ship expensive items.USPS includes insurance in some shipments, so you may already have insurance when you buy a shipping label from your Ecwid admin.Factor in all shipping fees.Carriers have lots of special charges like a Saturday delivery fee or a fee for requiring a signature from the recipient, to name a few.Be sure to include all the extra costs in customer bills, so you don't end up absorbing them yourself.In Ecwid, you can charge your customers extra by using a handling fee on all orders or a hidden shipping markup on live rates.Besides, you can cover the shipping expenses just for certain products (e.g., for fragile or large items in your product line) by adding a hidden fee as a fixed rate per item on top of your regular shipping costs.Be careful when adding extra fees as you want to keep your prices competitive on the market.Was this article helpful?Articles in this

it takes into the truck, aircraft, or ship.However, charging light-weight merchandise based on weight became unprofitable and environmentally demanding quickly, as the merchandise took too much space in proportion to its actual weight.Dimensional shipping is the right tactic to help you increase the accuracy of your shipping rates, and reduce shipping costs.One major key factor influencing dimensional shipping is the product dimensions.The product dimensions are as follows- weight, length, width, and volume.Dimensional shipping can also be called dimensional packaging.All the terms are used in combinations but mean the same thing usually.If you are not new to shipping, the chances are you already heard about this shipping feature for your e-commerce.There are specific algorithms and software that can automate dimensional shipping.Meet Smart Packaging which is one of them.What is Smart Packaging?Smart Packaging, also known as dimensional packaging, is the algorithm based on product and package dimensions that “pre-packs” an order into given packages in an optimal way in real-time.Afterward, the carrier shipping rates (from UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL, and others) are requested together with the dimensions of selected packages.This helps to increase the accuracy of shipping rates displayed at the checkout significantly and therefore to make shipping cost-effective.Why Use Smart Packaging and How It Improves Your Business?The better question is why aren’t you using smart packaging already?There are many reasons why companies switch to using Smart Packaging.Let’s have a look at some of the reasons here:\nAccurate Shipping Rates\nSmart Packaging helps you to obtain more accurate shipping rates from your carriers.The accuracy of the shipping rates based only on the weight parameter is very low.Merchandise based only on weight is like paying for air in the box to be shipped.Shipping rate accuracy increases with the calculated dimensional (also known as volumetric) weight compared to regular weight.However, the highest accuracy of shipping rates is only achieved if you provide the carrier with the actual package dimensions and its weight that the order will be shipped with.With Smart Packaging, you can obtain the highest accuracy of your shipping rates.Waste Reduction\nNow that you stopped shipping empty air and started using algorithms that optimize your packaging, you saved space and reduced the waste coming from all the filling materials used in the packages as well as from transportation of ineffectively packed orders.Smart Packaging makes shipping eco-friendly and reduces the harmful impact it has on the environment.This is also a very good branding line to use for your e-commerce.Cost Reduction\nSmart Packaging reduces your shipping costs significantly.How is that?If you ship a small item in a bigger box than necessary, you pay more than you should have, because the parameters of the box are big and the package takes too much space in the carrier’s truck.Carriers charge more for larger boxes, so using Smart Packaging helps.Customer Satisfaction\nSmart Packaging diminishes the shipping costs on the side of both the retailer and customer.Costs inquired using custom Smart Packaging are much lower than those of standard shipping based on weight parameter only.Thus the gap between what both parties need to pay for shipping and delivery is smaller.Displaying the amount of money a customer saved on shipping at the checkout, definitely increases customer satisfaction which ultimately leads to a loyal customer base.Branding\nAlso, your customers will be happy to see the orders that are effectively packed instead of air traveling in your boxes.Therefore by choosing smart packaging you also ensure that you are showing your customers that you care about the environment through packaging.The right branding gives your e-commerce a competitive advantage and sets you apart from all your competitors.How Does Smart Packaging Work?The process of Smart Packaging is really simple and mostly depends on the merchandise that is being shipped.See the steps below to see how Smart Packaging works.Set the dimensions of your product (its length, height, and width) in your e-commerce platform.Add all the packages you ship with, their dimensions, tare weight, and weight capacity;\nThe algorithm will choose the best packaging configuration for each order in real-time;\nGet the most accurate real-time shipping rates from carriers for all your smart packed shipments.All the information is sent to the carriers automatically.Turn on Smart Packaging for your E-commerce\nThere are many shipping extensions available to help your e-commerce with real-time rates and dimensional shipping.However, not many of them offer reliable Smart Packaging algorithms.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"X5MpquateNyWS+q/uxtvGXbu0IhKQm84ZlnDmhxp+J8="},"597a97a1-955c-4cd5-a0ec-7afa7e76b7a5":{"id_":"597a97a1-955c-4cd5-a0ec-7afa7e76b7a5","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/@arkapackaging-dm/in-the-past-shipping-used-to-be-based-only-on-the-weight-of-the-merchandise-it-takes-into-the-2aa49b269b9"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"8dd13dc8-5d26-4b5c-9a9d-3331a4c7c2df","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/@arkapackaging-dm/in-the-past-shipping-used-to-be-based-only-on-the-weight-of-the-merchandise-it-takes-into-the-2aa49b269b9"},"hash":"GdZcIHnDTG/6Ss0WK0h2l8VvoirbKZJoiIht89VWaUg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"65549301-9cb8-4522-b0a2-4ea993f5ba19","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/@arkapackaging-dm/in-the-past-shipping-used-to-be-based-only-on-the-weight-of-the-merchandise-it-takes-into-the-2aa49b269b9"},"hash":"X5MpquateNyWS+q/uxtvGXbu0IhKQm84ZlnDmhxp+J8="}},"text":"Therefore

waste.Sometimes you might need to partner with professional shipping software to achieve your company’s specific goals, whether it is waste reduction or cost-effective and sales-stimulating

being shipped in a poly mailer.Poly mailers are the best option when it comes to handling fragile products because they can be easily broken or destroyed.Some of these fragile products are fabric materials and shoes that might not stay sealed for long during the shipping process.The second thing to consider is the size of the product.Can it fit into a poly mailer?Remember, it is not all fragile goods that can be shipped in a poly mailer.Shipping packages like poly mailers should not be used to ship foodstuff like chips and smashable items like eyeglasses or any glass made object.Boxes with cushioning are most preferred for this packaging.The post office is known for sorting a lot of packages daily with so many scanning to do in the process.A poly mailer with flat spot mistakes can hinder the process and get misread by the machines when detected.1.Fabrics\nMost fabric based products are good for poly mailers.They may include face masks, bed cover sets, and pieces of patterned materials.2.Attires\nPoly mailers are best suited for attires because they cannot be crushed or broken.These products are dresses, shirts, trousers, and footwear.3.Health and Beauty Products\nThese products are good and very important for your customers but can only be useful if packaged and delivered properly.It can be shipped in both poly mailers and boxes.40% of consumers sort to upload pictures of their packaged product online.Imagine shipping these beauty products in a branded poly mailer.Although, some liquid products like liquid mascara, eyeliner, and facial cleansers are not suitable for them.4.Books and Printed Documents\nThese products can be ripped and destroyed and so can be suitable for a poly mailer.But for extra security and preservation, a bubble lined poly mailer is best for it.From the name, bubble lined poly mailers are made of bubble pads that give an extra touch of security for any product that could get broken or scratched.5.Shoes\nIt is not a must to use blank packaging boxes, you can use poly mailers to ship shoes to customers.I know you are probably thinking it is impossible.Custom packaging companies like Arka design quality poly mailers for products that are not very fragile.With Arka poly mailers, your shoes are safe and secured.6.Accessories\nCan you ship accessories in a poly mailer?The answer is yes.However, you need more than just the poly mailer to come through.You need other packaging accessories to ensure that none of the items gets missing along the way.How do I Select the Right Poly Mailer?Before you select any type or style of poly mailer for your product, here are a few tips for the right choice to keep in mind.1.Strength and Durability Factor\nMost shipping materials will have to undergo a crushing test to determine their strength, but there is no general definition of strength for poly mailer strength.The thickness of the mailer, as well as the various layers used in producing it, is what makes up its strength.We suggest that when you order samples or start little with any shipping product, you should test the poly mailers before you can actively start using them to protect your quality products.2.Peel and Seal Factor\nLately, customers tend to go for shopping experiences that make it easy for them to return the products without stress.This is why the dual peel and seal factor is important.It has adhesives that help you pack your order and the other for your customers, in case they need to return the product in the same poly bag.Customers always come back for such privileges.3.Tear Strip Factor\nPoly mailers have a tear strip that makes it easy for your customer to open them.Without this feature, there will be a lot of pokes and tears on the mailer.These tear strips also create more room for the bag to be reused subsequently.4.Bottom Factor\nThere is an advantage for some poly mailers that have a gusseted bottom.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cpF/noixqDb+v1+JomgsS05Muzl/ZPRSGM+Zxkas+FY="},"fe016e4b-8787-4064-b5cb-1342108acbfe":{"id_":"fe016e4b-8787-4064-b5cb-1342108acbfe","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/@arkapackaging-dm/a-complete-guide-to-using-poly-mailers-afe74f11075b"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"16041413-964a-4479-ab13-cea729d07124","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/@arkapackaging-dm/a-complete-guide-to-using-poly-mailers-afe74f11075b"},"hash":"mBgRKv972HpAYzj987vpAx8wXv1r34m9+iCNJj57ZZc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b51c297c-d82a-49c0-a942-acef097a335a","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/@arkapackaging-dm/a-complete-guide-to-using-poly-mailers-afe74f11075b"},"hash":"BEJlQGju1tn8/5Hthpxscq3POaymQfmWAg3kroh4nJM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0463efac-fb4a-4166-8e4e-0f1889a7b29d","metadata":{},"hash":"mttf1bd/Nn/O+xsbG/azWQXxee2NSpCRMle77QNmOzU="}},"text":"We

room for the bag to be reused subsequently.4.Bottom Factor\nThere is an advantage for some poly mailers that have a gusseted bottom.This is because this feature allows the bag to expand when shipping bulky items like jewelry shoe boxes.These types of poly mailers can be used for more than one product at a time as long as they are compatible.You’ll be saving more money with poly mailers that have a gustted bottom.Though, not all products need this style of bottom.Can I Custom Print My Poly Mailer\nYes, you can!Custom printed poly mailers are very attractive and more acceptable than blank mailers.Arka can provide you with designer poly mailers.Most poly mailers manufacturers near me offer printing services too.However, you have to go for the best manufacturers.Arka understands how to satisfy their customers, making them ask for more.If you are purchasing a large quantity, you can consider a pre-production printing service.But for small quantity’s post-production printing will be more effective.How Much Do Poly Mailers Cost?It depends on the quality, strength, and size of the poly mailer.It also depends on the ability of the poly mailer to be reused or on what type of material it is made of.Some companies that use poly mailers can ship for no extra cost when you have small shipments.Arka has different price options for their poly mailers.And you can purchase in small or large quantities.You also have the right to choose how you want your poly mailers to look like.Are Poly Mailers Reusable?Yes.As earlier stated, tear strips make it possible for some of these poly mailers to be reusable.It allows the customer to easily open these poly bags without having to puncture a hole or cause a tear on them.Polybags can also be reused by simply folding sides approximately and using tapes over them for total coverage.But then again, why would anyone want to reuse these poly mailers?Most customers that make orders will also want to be able to return these products due to fitting or color reasons.This is a good reason to make these bags reusable.Eventually, it adds a star to your brand.49% of consumers are ready to purchase these packaging for a little more than usual.A different scenario will be in cases where we have customers that are cost and eco-conscious.They will want to keep these bags to send a package next time.Our customers deserve the best.Are Poly Mailers Recyclable?Yes.Most of these poly bags are recyclable because they are made with Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE).Polybags made with LDPE are lightweight and this makes it easy for them to get folded up in the machines meant for sorting.In the end, they get stuck and cause damages that may require manual removal to fix them.Conclusion\nPoly mailers remain a great packaging system for eCommerce businesses that are fully ready to ship and save more money and products.Be sure to contact the Arka company today to know how we can help you to optimize your eCommerce business and

Books Log in\nDetails\nRevision #3\nCreated 4 months ago by Farrah\nGeneral Business Supplies\nGeneral Needs/Supplies...\nPage Revisions\nRevision #20 Changes\nGeneral Needs/Supplies/Suppliers\nThe General Process\nFor products that we do not have a specific contact, nor specific requirements for ordering...\nWe can log in to their website using the \"supplies@tea-tavern.com\" email with the corresponding Vaultwarden credentials to make the order.\nExpectations\nThe Tea Tavern's order of priority for determining which product to purchase for the given purpose:\nEco-friendliness\nCan it be composted?\nIf not, can it be recyclable recycled materials?\nIf not, Can it be recycled?\nIs it clear what is least damaging to the people we serve (including the environment they live in?)\nIf the above is too unclear to make a determination, take the best, and move on to the next priority item.\nPrice/Effectiveness (Needs to be balanced)\nDoes it get the product to our customers effectively?\nIf it gets rained on, will the product be okay?\nIf it gets crushed, is the product okay?\nIf it gets hot, will it melt?\nIs it the cheapest we can find that fulfills our needs?\nTo reduce shipping costs, can we get the same or similar things from the same vendor at the same time as other products?\nDesign\nCan it be customized?\nDoes it look nice?\nIs the quality of the product higher than the others? (Do not spend too much time on this)\nIf all the above are ordered, and it comes down to more than one option, then take the relevant information and ask leadership to decide further priorities.\nTea Packaging\nThe Tea Container\nCurrently, we use Kraft bags with an aluminum laminate inside. \nThere are many suppliers for what appears to be the exact same bag.\nIs there a difference? (needs to be researched)\nBased on Elevate Packaging's catalogue, they are compostable.\nBased on the Kraft Packaging Store's catalogue, they are aluminum foil (laminate?) within kraft paper.\nCurrent known vendor options:\nhttps://www.kraftpackagingstore.com/\nhttps://elevatepackaging.com/\nPossible future options:\nSome places are developing seaweed-based plastic replacement products. They are supposed to be \"Restorative\" rather than just \"recyclable\", \"compostable\", or \"carbon-neutral\".\nLabels for Tea Containers (TODO)\nShipping Supplies\nShipping tape\nWe currently order compostable shipping tape from the following places:\nElevate Packaging\nPure Labels\nReasoning for the above vendors:\nElevate Packaging's Standards\nPure Labels' Standards\nShipping Labels\nElevate packaging and pure labels' products are the same on this one.\nEach are entirely compostable.\nIf something else is being ordered from one of these vendors, try to get these labels into the same order to save on shipping costs.\nElevate Packaging Labels\nPure label's Labels\nShipping Boxes\nCardboard boxes are compostable, making most of the work pretty simple. The concern is mostly the ink (toxticity?), and if the cardboard has a covering. \nIf price allows (mostly killed by shipping costs), order from Arka.com. They help make sure the Ink is okay and can give a good description of what the price will be for a variety of boxes in bulk, and are the most likely to ship in an ecologically friendly way.\nCurrent options:\nArka\nUPS?\nUSPS?\nHome Depot?\nOffice
