There are enough expenses required to run a successful business that you shouldn’t have to worry about paying too much for shipping. You can look at cutting costs in four areas: Finding lower shipping rates, using the right shipping services, affordable packaging, and streamlining shipping workflow. If you can do these things, more cost-effective shipping will follow. Trust us! Afterall, affordable shipping is what ShipStation does best. With this guide, we’ll help you find ways to decrease spending and make shipping quicker and more efficient.\\nTable of Contents\\nFind Lower Shipping Rates \\nChoosing the Right Shipping Services Reduce Shipping Costs\\nAffordable Packaging Reduces Shipping Costs\\nStreamline Shipping and Fulfillment\\nConclusion: How to Keep Shipping Costs Low\\nFind Lower Shipping Rates \\nThe simplest way to reduce shipping costs is to make shipping labels more affordable. Don’t pay retail rates you’d find at the post office. There’s plenty of discounts out there and simple to get. Additionally, customers are increasingly cost conscious especially when it comes to delivery charges. Growing your business will require you to keep shipping costs low. But it’s easier than you may think. Instead of negotiating volume-based pricing, you can access deep savings on the services you already use! We offer shipping discounts of up to 89% for USPS, UPS, DHL Express, and many more carriers thanks to our ShipStation Carrier Services. We’ll get into how ShipStation’s shipping and fulfillment features help you reduce shipping costs later, but for now, let’s go on and talk about shipping discounts.  \\nUSPS Shipping Discounts \\nThe USPS is a leading carrier for all US merchants. Everyone uses the USPS. And if you need to print shipping labels, ShipStation users can access the lowest USPS postage rates in the industry. All you have to do is sign up for a free 30-day trial account. Get instant savings such as: \\nUp to 89% off USPS retail prices\\nMail Express® – Save up to 17% off Post Office rates on all Priority Mail Express shipments.\\nPriority Mail® – Save up to 35% off Post Office rates on all Priority Mail shipments, depending on weight and distance.\\nFirst Class Package Service – Save up to 26% off Post Office rates on all First Class Parcels.\\nInternational Shipping – Save up to 5% on Priority Mail International shipments, up to 8% for Priority Mail Express International and up to 5% on First Class Package International Service.\\n*CPP rates are usually reserved for business shipping at least 50,000 units a year. Pay up to 15% lower than these CPP rates simply by signing up for ShipStation.\\nUPS® Shipping Discounts\\nUPS offers fantastic services and rates for parcels of all shapes, sizes, and delivery needs. This is made even better with ShipStation’s shipping discounts offered through UPS® from ShipStation. The rate you see at checkout is what you pay, and these UPS® discounts are incredible. \\nUp to 78% off UPS® Ground\\nUp to 88® off UPS® International Services\\nUp to 72% off UPS 2nd Day Air®\\nand many more\\nDHL Express Shipping Discounts for International Orders\\nDHL Express is a world leader in international logistics. With ShipStation, you can save up to 75% on shipping costs. ShipStation users can create a new DHL Express account, save on shipping, and use a single postage balance for shipping labels for DHL, UPS, USPS, and more. Having options like DHL Express at your disposal help grow your business internationally. \\nConsolidation, Insurance, and Freight Shipping Discounts\\nThere are ways to ship beyond major carriers. You can diversify your shipping strategy and account for edge cases and bulk delivery needs. Accounts are easy to set up and shipping is as simple as any other carrier. Here are some that you can use through ShipStation. \\nLTL Freight Discounts through Seko LTL\\nShipStation offers other great ways to save on shipping costs, too. For instance, if you want to deliver LTL freight, Seko LTL is also offered through ShipStation Carrier Services. All you need to start shipping large items or pallets across the country is in our carrier services. \\nShipping Consolidator Discounts\\nGlobalPost is a cost-effective way to ship your domestic and international orders. With hubs and last-mile carrier partners in 220+ countries, GlobalPost can help you grow your business with affordable shipping rates and efficient tracking and consolidation options.\\nGP Economy = 78% off\\nGP Standard = 72% off\\nGP Plus = 74% off\\nInsurance Shipping Discounts from Shipsurance\\nShipsurance from ShipStation allows you to provide insurance coverage for your customers’ parcels for less money than the carriers. It even provides coverage for services that carrier coverage won’t allow! A seller who insures 10 packages per day for a value of $100 each could save $4,375 annually. Additionally, our Stamps.com USPS integration offers parcel coverage at a rate of 40% lower than you’d find from the carrier. \\nChoosing the Right Shipping Services Reduce Shipping Costs\\nEven with the best shipping discounts, using the best service for each shipping is a must. No one—from the newest business to the biggest corporation—wants to throw money away. Sometimes, merchants feel locked into certain carriers and don’t know that they have more affordable options. For instance, you may think a parcel weighing 1.5 lbs would be most affordable with USPS Priority Mail, but UPS® Ground may be more affordable. Carrier rates change, incentives come around, and you may be stuck using the same old service. Over time, this adds up!\\nNot using the most optimal carrier or service for your shipments can cause slower delivery and wasted money. Additionally, using the best shipping service saves you more than just money, it can save you time too! Anyone running a business knows that the simplest math equation is  Time = Money. No company is too big or too small to optimize shipping. There are scenarios that are tried and true and others that can change based on a few criteria. \\nStandard Shipping: USPS First Class Mail® vs USPS Priority Mail®\\nThe question of when to use USPS First Class Mail® or Priority Mail® usually comes down to if the parcel weighs less than 16 ounces. Any package under a pound will usually ship most affordably with USPS First Class Mail. While First Class can take a day or two longer to reach its destination, the savings are substantial enough to make it worth it for economical or standard shipping. \\nUPS® Ground vs USPS Priority Mail®\\nUPS® Ground and USPS Priority Mail® are two of the most important shipping services for merchants shipping parcels. They both offer detailed tracking and similar 1–4 day shipping timeframes. The old rule of thumb is: They offer competitive rates for small, light parcels. But as you move up in weight and size, UPS® takes the lead. But this is more for retail rates. With UPS® from ShipStation, you can save up to 78% on UPS® Ground. Shipping rates this low can change which shipping service you choose—especially for small, light parcels that USPS historically wins on. Comparing rates to find the cheapest way to ship is crucial for reducing shipping costs. \\nExpress Shipping: What to Use For Fast Shipping\\nFor express shipping, you have a few options to choose from. With ShipStation, you can save big on both UPS® and USPS express shipping services. For instance, UPS® 2nd Day Air is available at a discount of up to 72% off. But there are other options, too. USPS Priority Mail Express offers great rates, particularly for lightweight parcels. As with other shipping services, rate shopping tools like a shipping calculator will give you the best idea of when to use a specific service as well as a better delivery timeframe. \\nAffordable Overnight Shipping Options\\nNext-day shipping is a separate beast. These services are expensive and you have to ship them by a certain time of day in order to even have it be accepted. Depending on the delivery area, carrier or service, overnight shipping rates can accrue additional carrier surcharges. This is why it is good to use a service like UPS from ShipStation. The rate you pay at checkout is much more likely to be the final price you pay. This helps you avoid end-of-month surprises on your invoice. \\nUSPS Media Mail Reduces Shipping Costs For Books, Movies, and Music \\nUSPS Media Mail helps merchants reduce shipping costs when shipping books, movies, music, and other physical media. If you are sending qualified materials, Media Mail helps reduce shipping costs. Media Mail allows you to ship parcels weighing up to 70 lbs. anywhere in the US, so you can ship volumes of encyclopedias for cheap!\\nIs Flat Rate Shipping Best For Reducing Shipping Costs? \\nFlat-rate packaging can be an easy way to save money on shipping. However, there are situations where standard packaging is more affordable. This is especially true if you’re shipping lightweight items. The USPS hopes you ship a sweater in a flat rate box! Flat rate services work because carriers have specially designed the packages to fit neatly into their trucks, pass through facilities, and be delivered with ease. Flat-rate boxes are most affordable when shipping heavy items (that fit in the box, of course). \\nHow to Reduce International Shipping Costs\\nInternational shipping is notoriously expensive. But, there are always places to trim costs. There is no tried and true option for cheapest international shipping options unless you use First Class Mail International. But, with no tracking or delivery timeframe, it’s not going to win any awards. Factors like country, size, and speed play heavily into which service will work best. That’s why it’s recommended to have access to as many carriers as possible to find the best way to ship. Having DHL Express, UPS, USPS, Global Post, and FedEx accounts will allow you to keep costs as low as possible. \\nAffordable Packaging Reduces Shipping Costs\\nReduce Packaging Costs With Poly Mailers and Bubble Mailers\\nPoly mailers and bubble mailers are affordable packaging options that work with most parcel shipping services. Parcel delivery services consider these bags to be packages, not envelopes. But, they’re pliable, can fit into nooks in delivery vehicles, and can usually fit in mailboxes. They’re also much more affordable to buy in bulk than boxes. Just be sure that you’re not putting items too fragile or pointy into these bags. They can break easily or puncture the mailer. This can cause additional handling fees. \\nHow to Get Free Shipping Supplies\\nThe best place to get free shipping supplies is from the carrier. You can usually get free shipping boxes, labels, etc. if you know where to look. Commonly offered free shipping supplies you can get from carriers include: \\nHazmat labels\\nDry Ice Labels\\nFlat Rate boxes\\nAirway bills \\nShipping tubes \\nExpress envelopes \\nShipStation also partners with Onyx Products for shipping supplies like printers and scales.\\nFree Carrier-Provided Shipping Supplies\\nFree carrier-provided shipping supplies go far beyond flat rate packaging. You can find many free accessories, supplies, and packaging to fit many different situations.\\nHow to get free shipping supplies from carriers\\nUPS Free Supplies\\nUSPS Free Supplies\\nFedEx Free Supplies\\nDHL Express Free Supplies\\nBuy Cheaper Shipping Supplies\\nNot all shipping supplies are going to be free. If you find yourself having to supply your own shipping materials, there are always affordable options like Uline, Amazon, or even stores like Staples. But, if items are already in rigid, cardboard boxes, they could be ready to ship on their own! Keep in mind, though, that information that lets you know what contents are inside—brand name, content types, pictures—can increase the risk of items being stolen. And this, in turn, can cause shipping insurance claims to be rejected. \\nStreamline Shipping and Fulfillment\\nRate Shop With a Rate Comparison Tool \\nOne way to reduce shipping costs is to see all the different carrier rates available for any given order. ShipStation’s rate calculator lets you make sure that you are using the best service every time you print a label. Comparing shipping services allows you to protect your profit margins. Just saving a few cents on every shipment can really add up! \\nShipping Automation Shortens Fulfillment Time\\nShipping and fulfillment is more than putting items in a box and slapping a label on it. Automated shipping workflows from ShipStation help you avoid manual tasks and allow you to reduce the time and money it takes to ship. Many ShipStation customers automate their workflow to the point that all they have to do is click “Create Label.”\\nAutomatically Configure Shipments\\nShipStation lets you apply specific actions to orders as soon as they import. You can configure import automations to your specific needs. There are countless configurations available for you to set up. For instance, any domestic order weighing under 1 lb needs to use USPS First Class Mail, you can configure that! So anything you find yourself repeating throughout the day can likely be automated. Taking this a step further, we can even bring this shipping service information over from your stores. \\nScan-Based Workflows Let You Ship The Right Items Every Time\\nIt can be a major headache if you send out duplicate items or wrong items to a customer. It adds work, causes negative customer experiences, and hurts your bottom line. Luckily, there is a solution! Scan to Verify ensures that a shipping label cannot be created until you scan the UPC or SKU barcodes on every item in an order. This customizable feature verifies that ALL items in and ONLY the items in an order are accounted for when you print the label. Features like this are available at no extra cost through ShipStation. If you were to find a standalone solution like this, it can become quite expensive. It is also an extra program to have to integrate your stores or order management system to. With ShipStation, it fits right into your shipping workflow. \\nConclusion: How to Keep Shipping Costs Low\\nShipping is a necessary expense of running an online business. But it doesn’t have to be difficult, and it doesn’t have to be expensive. Finding ways to charge for shipping, streamline your workflow, and keep costs low will protect your profit margins and help you grow your business. ShipStation wants to help you do all of these things. You can pass shipping savings to your customers with live, in-cart shipping rates, ship more quickly automated workflows, and save big with our low shipping rates.\\nPublished on November 29, 2022\\nWritten by James Messer\\nTOPICS\\nActualités ShipStation\\nCanaux de Vente\\nCarrier Rates\\nCase Studies\\nExpéditions\\nHoliday\\nPodcast\\nPrincipes de Base de L'expédition\\nSelling Channels\\nShipping Basics\\nShipping News\\nShipStation Product\\nShipStation Produits\\nTarifs Transporteurs\\nUncategorized\\nUser Story\\nWarehouse\\nJames Messer\\nJames Messer is a copywriter specializing in shipping, logistics, and ecommerce.\\nMore articles by James Messer →\\nMore Posts\\nHow the CUPW strike affects your business\\nOn November 15th, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) began a national strike, resulting in a complete shutdown of Canada Post operations.

When you’re first starting out, you may be buying your labels at the post office—hoping to one day have a driver instead hop down out of their truck and come to you to pick up outgoing parcels.\\nShipStation knows that shipping can be time-consuming and expensive. But there’s no reason that your business should be held back by something as essential as shipping. When you have to spend less time figuring out how to keep shipping costs low, you can spend more time growing your business. There are a few things you can do to increase your profit margins and gain a competitive edge over your competition:\\nUse online shipping\\nreduce shipping costs\\nShop around with multiple carriers\\nUse Multiple Carriers\\nHaving a multi-carrier shipping strategy helps keep costs low. Sometimes, businesses become accustomed to certain shipping services for a given package or destination. However, with rates constantly changing, increased fuel surcharges, and increased discounts, comparing rates lets you find the best shipping services for your parcels.\\nUse Shipping Software\\nUsing an online shipping platform like ShipStation is the most immediate way you can save money on ecommerce shipping. The difference between the retail prices the post office charges and the Commercial Base rates you pay through shipping software. Even if you only ship several parcels per week, the cost of shipping software can be offset simply through the money you save on postage. Let’s not forget the adage “Time is money.” The time-saving effects of online shipping are also advantageous enough to make the switch.\\nAs with most great tools, shipping software has a bit of a learning curve. It’s hard to hit the ground running with something as complex as ecommerce shipping. If you’ve used things UPS WorldShip or FedEx Shipping Manager, you are on your way. But once you get over that initial hump of learning the tools and features, you’ll wonder how you ever got through the day without it. Comparing calculated rates to find the best shipping method for your orders eventually becomes second nature.\\nReuse Packaging\\nIt may seem obvious, but re-using packaging is a great way to cut costs when shipping. Boxes experience wear and tear throughout their lifecycle. And the end consumer typically doesn’t notice the difference between a scuff on the corner of the box coming from its final delivery or if it was from a return shipment that you repurposed. Just make sure that the contents within its protective outer box are safe and sound. Additionally, don’t ever ship a parcel in the manufacturer’s box. This is a great way to get a parcel stolen from a customer’s doorstep. Furthermore, many insurance providers don’t accept claims for shipments in a manufacturer’s box.\\nUse Cost-Effective Cushioning\\nWays to ensure this are to use effective and affordable packing materials such as brown paper fill. Packing peanuts are a thing of the past and bubble wrap is mostly just fun to pop. There are more environmentally sound and affordable ways to transport goods. And at the end of the day, customers just want to get their package in one piece.\\nBrown paper fill works well because it is malleable and cheap. Simply stuff it in around the fragile contents of the box and make sure that it doesn’t jostle. Void fill is important for fragile material because roads are bumpy and no one’s perfect—you want to make sure any impact or dings don’t happen to your parcel’s contents. Sure, this larger, slightly heavier packaging technique can cause shipping rates to be a tad higher, but it’s a drop in the bucket compared to paying for a return label for broken merchandise.  \\nAdd Shipping Costs into Item Price\\n88% of customers prefer to shop on websites that offer free shipping. Makes sense, right? Well, as an ecommerce seller, you need to find ways to offer free shipping without breaking the bank. The most common way this happens is to inject the shipping costs into the item price. There’s no such thing as a free meal, and there’s no such thing as free shipping—someone’s gotta pay and it’s usually the customer. You have to keep your margins in mind. And if you ship items that are small and inexpensive to ship, a slight price increase may be unnoticeable to the customer. Research your competitors to see how they handle shipping costs, while the cheapest cost usually wins, if you can’t go too low, find a way to spin it more positively. First Class Mail typically doesn’t take more than 3-5 business days to make final delivery. And this is where a shipping software can really come in handy.\\nOffer “Same Day Shipping” for all orders. This is not the same as “Same Day Delivery” but it’s a good hook for your customers. It just means you’ll ship the order out on the same day as when the customer placed the order. A shipping software can reduce the shipping time so much that you can print the labels from anywhere on earth. Even if you ecommerce isn’t your day job, you can always print labels using something like a mobile app. This will send the customer an email notification and you can ship the parcel when you get home.\\nUse Carrier Provided Packaging\\nCarriers incentivize customers to use their more premium services by offering complimentary packagings. As such, these packagings tend to be service-restricted. So, if you get Priority Mail Flat Rate Envelopes, don’t use them with First Class Mail shipments. They will get returned to you.\\nTo see how much time and money you can save, sign up for a free ShipStation trial today\\nPublished on May 12, 2022\\nWritten by James Messer\\nTOPICS\\nActualités ShipStation\\nCanaux de Vente\\nCarrier Rates\\nCase Studies\\nExpéditions\\nHoliday\\nPodcast\\nPrincipes de Base de L'expédition\\nSelling Channels\\nShipping Basics\\nShipping News\\nShipStation Product\\nShipStation Produits\\nTarifs Transporteurs\\nUncategorized\\nUser Story\\nWarehouse\\nJames Messer\\nJames Messer is a copywriter specializing in shipping, logistics, and ecommerce.\\nMore articles by James Messer →\\nMore Posts\\nGet Discounted FedEx Shipping Rates With ShipStation\\nShipStation now offers up to 90% off FedEx services,* giving you greater flexibility and access to significant savings on a variety of FedEx shipping options.

Affordable shipping rates are available to anyone that knows where to look. And since you’re reading this, you’re already on the path to making shipping more affordable. ShipStation is all about saving you time and money on your shipping and fulfillment. And here, we’ll go over all the different ways you can find more affordable shipping options. You’ll discover new ways to use the services you use every day, new options you may have never heard of, and ways to create a better shipping workflow.\\nBreaking old habits can be hard, but once you find affordable shipping options and a simpler way to ship, you’ll wonder how you ever did things before. Sometimes a deal seems too good to be true. Other times, it’s better than you could’ve imagined. Here are the tricks and tips you’ll need to know to find the cheapest ways to ship your packages in 2024. \\nHow to Get the Cheapest Shipping Rates\\nAffordable shipping rates are available to anyone that knows where to look for them. And shipping software like ShipStation provide the tools you need to make it easier. From shipping calculators, to automated shipping tools, and so much more, you’ll soon be able to reduce shipping costs and get orders to your customers even faster.  Let’s go over how to create a shipping plan that sets you up for success. \\nTo access these savings, you simply need to sign up for ShipStation\\nUse Multiple Carrier Accounts\\nSometimes, merchants become accustomed to using the same carriers and services. Unbeknownst to them, there can be substantially more affordable options that deliver in less time. Using a mix of carriers like UPS, USPS, DHL Express, and FedEx helps merchants find the best way to ship any parcel. Luckily, ShipStation gives you instant access to many of these top carriers through ShipStation Carrier Services. You get savings of up to 89% on shipping services and buy postage from a single balance. ShipStation also helps you rate shop for the most affordable option. You can then automatically apply these services to future orders. But let’s move on to what you really want to know: The shipping discounts!\\nFind the Cheapest Shipping Rates\\nYou may not realize it, but anyone can be getting shipping rates that even Fortune 500 companies want. With ShipStation, you can save big on shipping—up to 89% on USPS Priority Mail® services, 77% on UPS® ground, 83% on UPS® International services, and many other shipping services. \\nCreate A Shipping and Fulfillment Workflow\\nWhen you ship multiple packages per day, a fine-tuned shipping strategy is essential. For any business, time is money. And a good shipping and fulfillment workflow saves you a lot of time. As mentioned above, ShipStation simplifies shipping by offering rate shopping options that let you pick the best shipping services for any given package. But we also offer automation processes that apply these shipping services as soon as an order comes into ShipStation. \\nCheapest Shipping Options Based on Delivery Time\\nDifferent services ensure delivery within specific timeframes. From economy to express, providing customers with affordable shipping options requires merchants to also save money. These are the preferred services for some common delivery timeframes.\\nCheapest Standard and 3-Day Shipping Options\\nStandard shipping options can vary based on a number of factors. For instance, if a parcel weighs under 16 oz, it’s likely you’re shipping it out with USPS First Class Mail®. But things begin to change when the weight goes up. Services like USPS Parcel Select® Ground take 2–8 days to reach the recipient and allow you to ship large parcels more affordably. Same goes with USPS Media Mail®. If you are sending approved materials, Media Mail is hard to beat. But other services like UPS® Ground, USPS Priority Mail®, and FedEx Ground® provide services that offer good ground shipping options. And depending on where they’re being shipped to, they may arrive sooner. UPS® Ground, for instance, may even arrive in as little as 24 hours. \\nCheapest Two-Day Shipping\\nTwo-day shipping options are very popular thanks to Amazon and other market leaders. Many consumers expect quicker delivery. ShipStation found that delivery speed is the second most important factor behind price for delivery options. There are many great 2-day shipping services. When you open a UPS account on ShipStation, you get discounts of up to 73% off UPS 2nd Day Air® service, 17% lower USPS Priority Mail Express rates, and 81% off DHL Express international services. Other 2-day shipping services include FedEx 2Day®. \\nCheapest Overnight Shipping\\nOvernight shipping is a premium shipping service, but there are ways to save. When you ship UPS on ShipStation, you get access to discounts on UPS Next Day Air® services. There are also other great services that can deliver next day including FedEx Standard Overnight®. For even more premium overnight options, look for AM services. ShipStation offers the following services: \\nOvernight Shipping Service Next-Day Delivery Time\\nUPS Next Day Air Saver® Arrives by end of business day\\nUPS Next Day Air® Arrives next day by noon\\nUPS Next Day® Early Arrives by 8 am to major metro areas, 9–9:30 am in many cities\\nFedEx Standard Overnight® Arrives by end of business day\\nFedEx Priority Overnight Arrives by 10:30 am to commercial addresses and 4:30 pm for residential\\nFedEx First Overnight® Arrives by 10:00 am for most areas and between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm for extended areas. \\nThe Cheapest Shipping Insurance\\nA major way to pay less for insurance is to use a third-party insurance provider, such as Shipsurance. When adding insurance to a shipment you pay the additional fees in increments of $100 insured value. Typically, carriers charge between $0.75-0.85 per $100 value, with a minimum cost of roughly $2.50. Shipsurance, however, only charges $0.55 per $100, and with no minimum cost. So you can save big by using this third party insurance. Applying Shipsurance to a parcel and filing a claim is very streamlined through ShipStation.\\nHow to Ship a Package Based on Size\\nThe size of a parcel is going to greatly determine your shipping rate. The more space a package takes in the back of a truck, the fewer parcels the carrier can transport at once. One way to maintain steady shipping costs is to opt for Flat Rate packages. But since this will not always give you the lowest rate, let’s explore some more packaging options.\\nHow to Send a Small Package\\nFirst Class Mail offers amazing rates for small parcels under 16 oz. But UPS® Ground and USPS Priority Mail® have great rates too and deliver much more quickly. Small parcels weighing over 16 oz can be more affordable than you’d think with services like UPS® Ground. \\nThe Cheapest Way to Ship Large Packages \\nIf you are using ShipStation rates, UPS usually costs less than USPS for large or heavy parcels. UPS® Ground and USPS Priority Mail® are two commonly used services. But USPS Parcel Select® is another one to look for. If you use FedEx, FedEx® Ground is a good option. \\nHow to Find Cheaper Dimensional Weight Pricing\\nEven if a large parcel is lightweight, shipping it can be expensive. Large parcels cost more because of their dimensional weight. Dimensional weight is a pricing structure that increases the shipping rate if a parcel is deemed too large in relation to its weight—think things like a bike rim or a hula hoop. Since packages take up so much space in cargo vehicles and airplanes, etc., their shipping rate increases with their size. \\nCarrier Domestic Dimensional Formula\\nUPS on ShipStation (L x W x H)/ 166\\nUSPS (L x W x H)/ 166\\nFedEx (L x W x H)/ 139\\nThe Cheapest Way to Ship Internationally\\nFor parcels weighing 4.4 lbs and under, USPS First Class Mail® International and GlobalPost Economy will be the most economical way to ship internationally. However, keep in mind that there are no requirements for estimated delivery time on this, so it may take weeks to arrive at its final destination. For quicker delivery—or for parcels weighing over 4.4 lbs—ShipStation offers discounts on GlobalPost and USPS. And when you ship UPS on ShipStation, you get access to discounts of up to 83% off UPS international services* and 81% off DHL Express international shipping as well!

We also have guides discussing how to ship to places as nearby as Canada and as far away as China. \\nCheapest Shipping Options Based on Weight\\nSimilar to size, the weight of a parcel can greatly impact its rate. Since we’ve already discussed size-based pricing and dimensional weight pricing, let’s take a look at what the most cost-effective shipping service is based on different weight groups and cubic pricing.\\nHow to Ship Packages Under 1 LB\\nAgain, USPS First Class Mail® is usually considered the most affordable shipping option for parcels weighing under 16 ounces unless USPS Media Mail rates can apply. However, when you ship UPS on ShipStation, you get discounts of up to 77%* off UPS® Ground that make it an attractive alternative—especially if the parcel needs to be delivered quickly. \\nHow to Send a 5 lb Package\\nFor parcels between 1-5 lbs, UPS® Ground rates on ShipStation provide merchants with versatile nationwide coverage for parcels sent to any destination. Other domestic services to look at include USPS Priority Mail and Parcel Select. \\nHow to Mail Packages Weighing 10 LBs or More\\nUPS rates on ShipStation also offer a great option for domestic parcels over 10 lbs. There are always variables that change this, though, so it’s best to rate shop for the best option. An important factor in choosing a shipping service, particularly when shipping heavier parcels is the distance a package requires to be delivered. Distance also impacts shipping rates. Carriers break pricing down into shipping zones. Understanding how zone impacts shipping costs help you pay substantially less money on delivery. \\nHow Cubic Weight Impacts Pricing \\nSmaller parcels usually cost less to ship because of their small cubic weight. Luckily, Cubic weight can decrease the shipping cost for small, heavy packages! Cubic weight is what allows smaller parcels to cost less than large ones that have the same weight. ShipStation offers great rates for these smaller packages through both USPS and UPS. \\nHow to Offer Customers the Cheapest Shipping Rates\\nFinding ways to make shipping more affordable for your customers means you’re less likely to see cart abandonment. ShipStation makes shipping much more affordable—allowing you to pass the savings on to your customers. \\nOffer Checkout Shipping Rates\\nOne way to capitalize on the affordable rates available in ShipStation is to use In-Cart Delivery Options. This exposes live rates to your customers in checkout. Fears of overcharging or undercharging can be a huge pain point for many ecommerce merchants. ShipStation lets Shopify, Wix, Magento, and BigCommerce merchants provide live-rate shipping options to their customers during checkout. These can be adjusted to include or decrease based on dollar amounts or percentages.\\nOffer Free Shipping for Cheaper\\nTypically you don’t want shipping to eat into more than 10-20% of your profit margins. A good way to offset free shipping costs is to incorporate shipping costs into the item cost. Merchants commonly utilize this method when selling through marketplaces like Amazon—since they require free shipping options for qualified orders. However, if you add too much of the shipping cost into the item price, you run the risk of losing more customers than if you charged separately for shipping. As a result, there are always factors to keep in mind when planning a pricing and shipping policy. \\nOffer Flat-Fee Shipping for Cheaper\\nFlat-fee shipping is a common practice for many merchants. One reason this option is so common is that it keeps prices stable. Surprises during checkout can deter customers. Flat-fee shipping allows you to cover shipping costs while making shipping cost low for customers. Knowing that shipping will cost $5 before placing an order is a lot less surprising then seeing an added $5 appear in checkout. \\nOffer Free Shipping Above a Threshold \\nA common practice of “having your cake and eating it too” is to offer free shipping above a certain price. This is commonly used in conjunction with flat-fee shipping. The way it works is to charge a single rate for shipping for any order (domestic, usually) below a price threshold. For instance: “$10 shipping for all orders under $75.” If the order total exceeds $75, shipping is free. Many companies incentivize larger purchases by offering free shipping above this threshold. \\nWhere to Find the Best Shipping Rates and Carrier Discounts\\nShipStation offers discounts on a range of carriers and label providers. While we’ve gone over many of these already, it’s always nice to hear how much money you can save. \\nUPS® Discounts Available on ShipStation \\nShipStation users who ship with UPS on ShipStation can print UPS® labels with discounts of up to 83%* off Daily Rates. With this reduced pricing, you can view real-time UPS® rates, print postage, and simplify the returns process directly within ShipStation.\\nThe UPS® Advantage for ShipStation Merchants\\n83% off UPS international services \\n77% off UPS® Ground shipments\\n73% for UPS 2nd Day Air®  service*\\nNo minimum shipping volume requirements\\nDiscounts on common delivery surcharges\\nGuaranteed delivery for applicable services\\nUpdated UPS® tracking and delivery alerts\\nDomestic and international delivery services\\n*Discounts off UPS daily rates.

There are a few things that go into shipping costs and what to charge. These are some of the things to be aware of when shipping online orders.\\nHow do I calculate shipping costs?\\nFrom weight, dimensions, destinations, additional surcharges, and more options, shipping costs have a lot of factors. There are very few flat rate shipping options. Let’s go over some of the most common things that influence shipping costs.\\nWeight\\nA package’s weight is a major deciding factor in a shipping carrier’s base rate. Typically, each new pound increases the shipping cost. While there are factors such as dimensions and shipping zones, it is usually weight that determines which shipping service to use. \\nDimensions\\nDimensions play a big part in shipping costs. Typically, a package’s dimensions don’t increase the rate to a new threshold. Rather, dimensions are more of a limiting factor—if you exceed a carrier’s maximum dimensions, it is subject to an additional handling surcharge. \\nDestinations and Shipping Zone\\nShipping zones are what carriers use to determine the distance between the origin and destination addresses of a domestic package. This distance is ranked in levels of 1-9. If the distance is a 1, or local, this is the shortest distance. Meanwhile, 9 is the furthest distance—overseas territories. Keep in mind, though, that international rates are determined a bit differently, though. \\nSurcharges\\nSurcharges increase shipping costs for customers and merchants alike. Surcharges are more common with carriers that post-bill, such as FedEx and UPS. These generally include additional fees for things like extended area delivery surcharges (a home in a more remote location) or residential surcharges. \\nHow UPS, FedEx, and USPS Treat Weight and Dimensions\\nUSPS Maximum Dimensions and Weight\\nThe USPS’ has a slightly smaller allowable maximum size than other carriers. Domestic pieces may not measure more than 108 inches in length and girth combined and 70 lbs in max weight. Oversized USPS parcels will have a $100 fee applied to them. \\nFedEx Maximum Dimensions and Weight\\nWith FedEx Ground® and FedEx Home Delivery® Services, you can ship packages up to 150 lbs; up to 108″ in length, and 165″ in length plus girth. An oversized surcharge of $52.50 applies to all FedEx parcels exceeding these size and weight limits. \\nUPS Maximum Dimensions and Weight\\nUPS allows packages up to 150 lbs with a maximum size of 165 inches in length and girth combined. An oversize surcharge of between $95-$115 will be applied to all UPS parcels exceeding these weight and size limits. \\nCubic Rates\\nCubic rates help make smaller, heavier parcels more affordable. Cubic rates are determined by a formula. Highly discounted rates for high-volume shippers for packages under 20lbs that are no larger than .5 cubic feet. \\nCubic Feet Formula\\nLength x Width x Height / 1728 = Cubic Feet\\nWhile ShipStation doesn’t offer full Cubic pricing, we do offer discounted cubic rates for any customer through our relationship with Stamps.com. \\nDimensional Weight\\nDimensional weight is the exact opposite of cubic rates. Instead of charging you less for small, heavy parcels. You get charged MORE for big, lightweight parcels. So, a can of chili and a pillow that have the same weight could have different shipping rates. \\nThe Dimensional formula\\nCarrier Domestic Dimensional Formula\\nUPS (L x W x H)/ 139\\nFedEx (L x W x H)/ 139\\nUSPS (L x W x H)/ 166\\nWhichever value weighs more between this outcome (the actual weight or the dimensional weight) will be what determines the shipping rate for the weight. \\nHow to Calculate USPS shipping cost\\nCalculating USPS shipping costs is generally more straightforward than UPS or FedEx. The rates don’t increase based on Saturday delivery or residential surcharges. Since USPS charges upon creation for a label, all fees are usually included in the initial cost. \\nHow to Calculate FedEx shipping cost\\nFedEx has more surcharges and factors to consider than USPS. For instance, FedEx has surcharges that can increase the price by a substantial amount. Things like residential surcharges and fuel surcharges may not be fully calculated until after an item is delivered.\\nShipping rates you’re quoted at the time of label creation may not accurately reflect the final shipping costs. For instance, the residential surcharge may not be applied when you use FedEx’s rate calculator. If your recipient is residential, use FedEx Home® delivery. This residential surcharge also allows for Saturday delivery at no extra cost. So the shipping cost you charge customers may need to be adjusted slightly. \\nHow to Calculate UPS shipping cost\\nSimilar to FedEx, UPS has additional shipping surcharges that increase the cost of a label from its base rate. However, if you want to avoid some of these surcharges and get more affordable UPS shipping rates, ShipStation’s integration with UPS offers cheaper shipping rates with fewer surcharges than you’d find with a standalone UPS account—which ShipStation also supports. \\nHow To Charge For Shipping\\nCustomers have eased up a bit on shipping timeframes and demanding free shipping. However, demand for clearly communicated shipping times and simple pricing structures has become stronger. For the most information about how customers prefer shipping, download ShipStation’s research guide that goes into detail about shipping expectations. \\nTo save on shipping your parcels as well as everything else, sign up for ShipStation to see how cheap shipping can be.\\nHow to Charge For Shipping on Etsy\\nEtsy makes charging shipping costs pretty easy. Since Etsy requires free shipping on orders over $35 for merchants participating in the free shipping guarantee, you may need to find cheap shipping options. Since customers are more likely to purchase from merchants offering free shipping, having an affordable shipping solution is key. Furthermore, you can inject some of the shipping costs into the item cost to increase cart conversions. \\nHow to Charge For Shipping on Amazon\\nAmazon is among the most rigid places to sell on—particularly if you want to become a Prime seller or to get the featured offer. Furthermore, offering free shipping is essential to being Prime or featured. Free shipping is a tad easier to offer if you can inject some of the shipping costs into the item’s price. However, this can be risky as you don’t want to be costlier than the featured seller. Many sellers cite Amazon as being a great place to get the word out about their products. With their rigid packaging guidelines and customer-centric returns strategy, some sellers just use Amazon as a marketplace for their lower-cost items with more affordable shipping prices. \\nHow to Charge For Shipping on eBay\\neBay has a few shipping guidelines to be aware of. For instance, you MUST use a shipping service with tracking. You also can’t use a slower shipping method than what the customer selects. Apart from this, there aren’t many rules. Shipping costs can be determined with the Ebay rate calculator. You may also use ShipStation’s USPS postage calculator to get a good idea of the rates available.\\nHow to Charge for Shipping on Your Website\\nIf you have your own website on platforms like Wix.com, Shopify, or WooCommerce, it is usually simplest to adopt some of the more favorable shipping options from your marketplace platforms. We found that 78% of customers have become more willing to shop from a small retailer than they were before COVID-19. So, this is a good time to move off of a marketplace and open your own store. But, the important thing to keep in mind is that customers do have expectations of quick delivery. So, if you can ship out items within 24 hours, offer affordable shipping costs, and send shipping confirmation emails in a timely manner, you should be good! Let’s go over how to determine these shipping costs. \\nTo start saving on shipping costs, sign up for a free ShipStation trial today!\\nHow Much to Charge For Domestic Shipping\\nDomestic shipping is usually pretty straightforward. You’ll find the shipping services that work best for your different items and regions of the country. The problem with domestic shipping is knowing what to charge. There are a few options that work well. Some are better for your customers and some are better for the merchant. \\nOffer Flat-Fee Shipping\\nFlat-fee shipping doesn’t require you use USPS Flat Rate boxes. However, this could be a good option if your parcels are heavy as it is the same rate as long as a parcel is under 70 lbs. This is especially good considering FedEx and UPS tend to be more affordable over about 6 lbs. \\nFlat-rate shipping is a good idea because customers don’t like surprises. This is why places like Amazon are so popular. Everything is quick, efficient, and easy to understand. Offering flat rate shipping is a good idea on your own website because it allows you to appear organized and in control of your shipping volume. Having different shipping rates for different items may be a good way to protect your profit margins, but it is less likely to result in an order being placed. Using something like “shipping is $4.99 for items under $75.” is a good way to get cart conversions while also incentivizing them to reach a threshold for free shipping.\\nWhy Charging Threshold Shipping Works\\nThreshold shipping is very common. It allows customers to get free shipping if they place an order above a certain cost. Generally, it’s just north of your average order total. This can be a way to get another item added to the cart. Advertising high-profit margin items that cost under about $20 can be an easy way to reduce surplus inventory as well as increase profits. \\nCustomers Prefer Free Shipping\\nObviously, free is king. If you can offer free shipping by injecting a little bit of the shipping cost into the item, do that. Our research study found that 56% of Americans expect free shipping in order to place an order. If you want to make these sales, you have to accept that your profit margin will narrow. Threshold shipping can be a way to get the best of both worlds, though.  \\nHow Much to Charge For International Shipping \\nInternational shipping is an entirely separate beast. It can be confusing, expensive, and an insufferably long ordeal to get international customers their orders. Free shipping is almost always off the table, even to nearby countries like Canada. Flat-fee shipping to certain countries is usually the best way to go as far as cart conversions go, but shipping fees can vary wildly from country to country. So it may be best to have rules set up to determine how much to add for shipping depending on the destination country. Shopify has a thorough tutorial on selling and shipping internationally that has plenty of good information. But let’s get into some of the finer points of shipping internationally that can become an expensive surprise for you and your customers. \\nHow Customs and Taxes Raise Shipping Costs\\nCustoms fees and import taxes can rack up quickly. And while it’s common for your customers to pay these import taxes, you may choose to pay them. And this can become a costly process. For instance, shipping to Europe has just become more expensive since VAT taxes apply to all international orders—not just those valued at over $22. Luckily, programs like the IOSS allow you to pay these fees instead of your customers for orders up to $150. Even if you charge customers based on these additional surcharges, it is easier than having to have them deal with it. Again, taxes and customs fees make international shipping very expensive. And the difficulties don’t end with it being more expensive. What happens if an item is rejected or undeliverable?\\nReturn to Sender vs Treat as Abandoned\\nWhen an item can not make final delivery to an international customer, you’re left with the decision to just scrap the item or to have it shipped back to you. Remember, once an item clears customs, those charges may still need to be paid, even once they’re returned. This can cause the final shipping charges to be far higher than the item cost. At this point, it may just be easier to just treat the item as abandoned. These are shipping options that you can configure. But, it is important to remember that regardless of which option you choose, you should charge international customers accordingly.\\nHow ShipStation Helps Reduce Shipping Costs\\nShipStation is a great tool for understanding shipping costs. With all your orders laid out regardless of order source, with the ability to compare different services and choose carriers based on the cheapest shipping price and delivery time-frame, you can figure out how much your shipping costs as well as how much to charge. \\nAdditionally, shipping costs include the amount of time it takes you and your team to fulfill an order. Luckily, ShipStation’s automation rules and user roles make shipping simple, automated, and avoids duplicate shipments. The leaner your processing time, the quicker your orders go out lets you work with a leaner, more efficient staff, pay less for shipping, charge your customers less—resulting in happier customers that give you better reviews and become repeat customers. \\nPublished on July 1, 2021\\nWritten by James Messer\\nTOPICS\\nActualités ShipStation\\nCanaux de Vente\\nCarrier Rates\\nCase Studies\\nExpéditions\\nHoliday\\nPodcast\\nPrincipes de Base de L'expédition\\nSelling Channels\\nShipping Basics\\nShipping News\\nShipStation Product\\nShipStation Produits\\nTarifs Transporteurs\\nUncategorized\\nUser Story\\nWarehouse\\nJames Messer\\nJames Messer is a copywriter specializing in shipping, logistics, and ecommerce.\\nMore articles by James Messer →\\nMore Posts\\nHow the CUPW strike affects your business\\nOn November 15th, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) began a national strike, resulting in a complete shutdown of Canada Post operations.

Shipsurance\\nShipsurance from ShipStation allows you to provide insurance coverage for your customers’ parcels for less money than the carriers.It even provides coverage for services that carrier coverage won’t allow!A seller who insures 10 packages per day for a value of $100 each could save $4,375 annually.Additionally, our Stamps.com USPS integration offers parcel coverage at a rate of 40% lower than you’d find from the carrier.Choosing the Right Shipping Services Reduce Shipping Costs\\nEven with the best shipping discounts, using the best service for each shipping is a must.No one—from the newest business to the biggest corporation—wants to throw money away.Sometimes, merchants feel locked into certain carriers and don’t know that they have more affordable options.For instance, you may think a parcel weighing 1.5 lbs would be most affordable with USPS Priority Mail, but UPS® Ground may be more affordable.Carrier rates change, incentives come around, and you may be stuck using the same old service.Over time, this adds up!Not using the most optimal carrier or service for your shipments can cause slower delivery and wasted money.Additionally, using the best shipping service saves you more than just money, it can save you time too!Anyone running a business knows that the simplest math equation is  Time = Money.No company is too big or too small to optimize shipping.There are scenarios that are tried and true and others that can change based on a few criteria.Standard Shipping: USPS First Class Mail® vs USPS Priority Mail®\\nThe question of when to use USPS First Class Mail® or Priority Mail® usually comes down to if the parcel weighs less than 16 ounces.Any package under a pound will usually ship most affordably with USPS First Class Mail.While First Class can take a day or two longer to reach its destination, the savings are substantial enough to make it worth it for economical or standard shipping.UPS® Ground vs USPS Priority Mail®\\nUPS® Ground and USPS Priority Mail® are two of the most important shipping services for merchants shipping parcels.They both offer detailed tracking and similar 1–4 day shipping timeframes.The old rule of thumb is: They offer competitive rates for small, light parcels.But as you move up in weight and size, UPS® takes the lead.But this is more for retail rates.With UPS® from ShipStation, you can save up to 78% on UPS® Ground.Shipping rates this low can change which shipping service you choose—especially for small, light parcels that USPS historically wins on.Comparing rates to find the cheapest way to ship is crucial for reducing shipping costs.Express Shipping: What to Use For Fast Shipping\\nFor express shipping, you have a few options to choose from.With ShipStation, you can save big on both UPS® and USPS express shipping services.For instance, UPS® 2nd Day Air is available at a discount of up to 72% off.But there are other options, too.USPS Priority Mail Express offers great rates, particularly for lightweight parcels.As with other shipping services, rate shopping tools like a shipping calculator will give you the best idea of when to use a specific service as well as a better delivery timeframe.Affordable Overnight Shipping Options\\nNext-day shipping is a separate beast.These services are expensive and you have to ship them by a certain time of day in order to even have it be accepted.Depending on the delivery area, carrier or service, overnight shipping rates can accrue additional carrier surcharges.This is why it is good to use a service like UPS from ShipStation.The rate you pay at checkout is much more likely to be the final price you pay.This helps you avoid end-of-month surprises on your invoice.USPS Media Mail Reduces Shipping Costs For Books, Movies, and Music \\nUSPS Media Mail helps merchants reduce shipping costs when shipping books, movies, music, and other physical media.If you are sending qualified materials, Media Mail helps reduce shipping costs.Media Mail allows you to ship parcels weighing up to 70 lbs.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"UAd7X7IbGW15qfRt54EQrxlrCa7fIh0lr90MGl/wazg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"10355cc0-04b5-4108-a62a-9bba2bd95f8e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"10355cc0-04b5-4108-a62a-9bba2bd95f8e\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-to-reduce-shipping-costs-for-a-small-business/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"99f7102d-92ee-453b-8431-aa210a6e6a94\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-to-reduce-shipping-costs-for-a-small-business/\"},\"hash\":\"WJTenR6BYXvak2qGaoquC071qq+kJ6HMgRRwzeqqSPE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"1591a835-4899-4715-a87c-0d0c71a7b954\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-to-reduce-shipping-costs-for-a-small-business/\"},\"hash\":\"xVhmo7eLSvBA2lSbXv2Kkhpoy0/0eFcRcM9UZZqj74M=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"abda4e6c-032e-422c-b286-5760eade500a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"ZQe6SdBOvEE2lGcgPtALbyTu1THBSsiy0bYplOfxOsI=\"}},\"text\":\"Affordable

to save money on shipping.However, there are situations where standard packaging is more affordable.This is especially true if you’re shipping lightweight items.The USPS hopes you ship a sweater in a flat rate box!Flat rate services work because carriers have specially designed the packages to fit neatly into their trucks, pass through facilities, and be delivered with ease.Flat-rate boxes are most affordable when shipping heavy items (that fit in the box, of course).How to Reduce International Shipping Costs\\nInternational shipping is notoriously expensive.But, there are always places to trim costs.There is no tried and true option for cheapest international shipping options unless you use First Class Mail International.But, with no tracking or delivery timeframe, it’s not going to win any awards.Factors like country, size, and speed play heavily into which service will work best.That’s why it’s recommended to have access to as many carriers as possible to find the best way to ship.Having DHL Express, UPS, USPS, Global Post, and FedEx accounts will allow you to keep costs as low as possible.Affordable Packaging Reduces Shipping Costs\\nReduce Packaging Costs With Poly Mailers and Bubble Mailers\\nPoly mailers and bubble mailers are affordable packaging options that work with most parcel shipping services.Parcel delivery services consider these bags to be packages, not envelopes.But, they’re pliable, can fit into nooks in delivery vehicles, and can usually fit in mailboxes.They’re also much more affordable to buy in bulk than boxes.Just be sure that you’re not putting items too fragile or pointy into these bags.They can break easily or puncture the mailer.This can cause additional handling fees.How to Get Free Shipping Supplies\\nThe best place to get free shipping supplies is from the carrier.You can usually get free shipping boxes, labels, etc. if you know where to look.Commonly offered free shipping supplies you can get from carriers include: \\nHazmat labels\\nDry Ice Labels\\nFlat Rate boxes\\nAirway bills \\nShipping tubes \\nExpress envelopes \\nShipStation also partners with Onyx Products for shipping supplies like printers and scales.Free Carrier-Provided Shipping Supplies\\nFree carrier-provided shipping supplies go far beyond flat rate packaging.You can find many free accessories, supplies, and packaging to fit many different situations.How to get free shipping supplies from carriers\\nUPS Free Supplies\\nUSPS Free Supplies\\nFedEx Free Supplies\\nDHL Express Free Supplies\\nBuy Cheaper Shipping Supplies\\nNot all shipping supplies are going to be free.If you find yourself having to supply your own shipping materials, there are always affordable options like Uline, Amazon, or even stores like Staples.But, if items are already in rigid, cardboard boxes, they could be ready to ship on their own!Keep in mind, though, that information that lets you know what contents are inside—brand name, content types, pictures—can increase the risk of items being stolen.And this, in turn, can cause shipping insurance claims to be rejected.Streamline Shipping and Fulfillment\\nRate Shop With a Rate Comparison Tool \\nOne way to reduce shipping costs is to see all the different carrier rates available for any given order.ShipStation’s rate calculator lets you make sure that you are using the best service every time you print a label.Comparing shipping services allows you to protect your profit margins.Just saving a few cents on every shipment can really add up!Shipping Automation Shortens Fulfillment Time\\nShipping and fulfillment is more than putting items in a box and slapping a label on it.Automated shipping workflows from ShipStation help you avoid manual tasks and allow you to reduce the

they import.You can configure import automations to your specific needs.There are countless configurations available for you to set up.For instance, any domestic order weighing under 1 lb needs to use USPS First Class Mail, you can configure that!So anything you find yourself repeating throughout the day can likely be automated.Taking this a step further, we can even bring this shipping service information over from your stores.Scan-Based Workflows Let You Ship The Right Items Every Time\\nIt can be a major headache if you send out duplicate items or wrong items to a customer.It adds work, causes negative customer experiences, and hurts your bottom line.Luckily, there is a solution!Scan to Verify ensures that a shipping label cannot be created until you scan the UPC or SKU barcodes on every item in an order.This customizable feature verifies that ALL items in and ONLY the items in an order are accounted for when you print the label.Features like this are available at no extra cost through ShipStation.If you were to find a standalone solution like this, it can become quite expensive.It is also an extra program to have to integrate your stores or order management system to.With ShipStation, it fits right into your shipping workflow.Conclusion: How to Keep Shipping Costs Low\\nShipping is a necessary expense of running an online business.But it doesn’t have to be difficult, and it doesn’t have to be expensive.Finding ways to charge for shipping, streamline your workflow, and keep costs low will protect your profit margins and help you grow your business.ShipStation wants to help you do all of these things.You can pass shipping savings to your customers with live, in-cart shipping rates, ship more quickly automated workflows, and save big with our low shipping

to Reduce eCommerce Shipping Costs\\nShipping costs are a major expense for any e-commerce merchant.When you’re first starting out, you may be buying your labels at the post office—hoping to one day have a driver instead hop down out of their truck and come to you to pick up outgoing parcels.ShipStation knows that shipping can be time-consuming and expensive.But there’s no reason that your business should be held back by something as essential as shipping.When you have to spend less time figuring out how to keep shipping costs low, you can spend more time growing your business.There are a few things you can do to increase your profit margins and gain a competitive edge over your competition:\\nUse online shipping\\nreduce shipping costs\\nShop around with multiple carriers\\nUse Multiple Carriers\\nHaving a multi-carrier shipping strategy helps keep costs low.Sometimes, businesses become accustomed to certain shipping services for a given package or destination.However, with rates constantly changing, increased fuel surcharges, and increased discounts, comparing rates lets you find the best shipping services for your parcels.Use Shipping Software\\nUsing an online shipping platform like ShipStation is the most immediate way you can save money on ecommerce shipping.The difference between the retail prices the post office charges and the Commercial Base rates you pay through shipping software.Even if you only ship several parcels per week, the cost of shipping software can be offset simply through the money you save on postage.Let’s not forget the adage “Time is money.”The time-saving effects of online shipping are also advantageous enough to make the switch.As with most great tools, shipping software has a bit of a learning curve.It’s hard to hit the ground running with something as complex as ecommerce shipping.If you’ve used things UPS WorldShip or FedEx Shipping Manager, you are on your way.But once you get over that initial hump of learning the tools and features, you’ll wonder how you ever got through the day without it.Comparing calculated rates to find the best shipping method for your orders eventually becomes second nature.Reuse Packaging\\nIt may seem obvious, but re-using packaging is a great way to cut costs when shipping.Boxes experience wear and tear throughout their lifecycle.And the end consumer typically doesn’t notice the difference between a scuff on the corner of the box coming from its final delivery or if it was from a return shipment that you repurposed.Just make sure that the contents within its protective outer box are safe and sound.Additionally, don’t ever ship a parcel in the manufacturer’s box.This is a great way to get a parcel stolen from a customer’s doorstep.Furthermore, many insurance providers don’t accept claims for shipments in a manufacturer’s box.Use Cost-Effective Cushioning\\nWays to ensure this are to use effective and affordable packing materials such as brown paper fill.Packing peanuts are a thing of the past and bubble wrap is mostly just fun to pop.There are more environmentally sound and affordable ways to transport goods.And at the end of the day, customers just want to get their package in one piece.Brown paper fill works well because it is malleable and cheap.Simply stuff it in around the fragile contents of the box and make sure that it doesn’t jostle.Void fill is important for fragile material because roads are bumpy and no one’s perfect—you want to make sure any impact or dings don’t happen to your parcel’s contents.Sure, this larger, slightly heavier packaging technique can cause shipping rates to be a tad higher, but it’s a drop in the bucket compared to paying for a return label for broken merchandise.Add Shipping Costs into Item Price\\n88% of customers prefer to shop on websites that offer free shipping.Makes sense, right?Well, as an ecommerce seller, you need to find ways to offer free shipping without breaking the bank.The most common way this happens is to inject the shipping costs into the item price.There’s no such thing as a free meal, and there’s no such thing as free shipping—someone’s gotta pay and it’s usually the customer.You have to keep your margins in mind.And if you ship items that are small and inexpensive to ship, a slight price increase may be unnoticeable to the customer.Research your competitors to see how they handle shipping costs, while the cheapest cost usually wins, if you can’t go too low, find a way to spin it more positively.First Class Mail typically doesn’t take more than 3-5 business days to make final delivery.And this is where a shipping software can really come in handy.Offer “Same Day Shipping” for all orders.This is not the same as “Same Day Delivery” but it’s a good hook for your customers.It just means you’ll ship the order out on the same day as when the customer placed the order.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"Y9UaXS2OclngHtvN71q6B6B97K6oHBFWCMVm6N7kmDY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"921b8979-c5ce-44f3-99ff-a9cb7132b3b5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"921b8979-c5ce-44f3-99ff-a9cb7132b3b5\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-to-reduce-ecommerce-shipping-costs/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"519ea9f1-c24a-4dc5-9a6a-7f78061eb8ec\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-to-reduce-ecommerce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"pedefH7cKO2Mtuab/G3Or8vCBVTZaeTjjHlpqTD2Klc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"55a308ca-327b-40e2-8ba6-24af2bcd2921\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-to-reduce-ecommerce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"Y9UaXS2OclngHtvN71q6B6B97K6oHBFWCMVm6N7kmDY=\"}},\"text\":\"There’s

labels using something like a mobile app.This will send the customer an email notification and you can ship the parcel when you get home.Use Carrier Provided Packaging\\nCarriers incentivize customers to use their more premium services by offering complimentary packagings.As such, these packagings tend to be service-restricted.So, if you get Priority Mail Flat Rate Envelopes, don’t use them with First Class Mail shipments.They will get returned to you.To see how much time and money you can save, sign up for a free ShipStation trial today\\nPublished on May 12, 2022\\nWritten by James

Cheapest Way to Ship a Package in 2024\\nFinding the cheapest way to ship a package doesn’t mean sacrificing quality.Affordable shipping rates are available to anyone that knows where to look.And since you’re reading this, you’re already on the path to making shipping more affordable.ShipStation is all about saving you time and money on your shipping and fulfillment.And here, we’ll go over all the different ways you can find more affordable shipping options.You’ll discover new ways to use the services you use every day, new options you may have never heard of, and ways to create a better shipping workflow.Breaking old habits can be hard, but once you find affordable shipping options and a simpler way to ship, you’ll wonder how you ever did things before.Sometimes a deal seems too good to be true.Other times, it’s better than you could’ve imagined.Here are the tricks and tips you’ll need to know to find the cheapest ways to ship your packages in 2024.How to Get the Cheapest Shipping Rates\\nAffordable shipping rates are available to anyone that knows where to look for them.And shipping software like ShipStation provide the tools you need to make it easier.From shipping calculators, to automated shipping tools, and so much more, you’ll soon be able to reduce shipping costs and get orders to your customers even faster.Let’s go over how to create a shipping plan that sets you up for success.To access these savings, you simply need to sign up for ShipStation\\nUse Multiple Carrier Accounts\\nSometimes, merchants become accustomed to using the same carriers and services.Unbeknownst to them, there can be substantially more affordable options that deliver in less time.Using a mix of carriers like UPS, USPS, DHL Express, and FedEx helps merchants find the best way to ship any parcel.Luckily, ShipStation gives you instant access to many of these top carriers through ShipStation Carrier Services.You get savings of up to 89% on shipping services and buy postage from a single balance.ShipStation also helps you rate shop for the most affordable option.You can then automatically apply these services to future orders.But let’s move on to what you really want to know: The shipping discounts!Find the Cheapest Shipping Rates\\nYou may not realize it, but anyone can be getting shipping rates that even Fortune 500 companies want.With ShipStation, you can save big on shipping—up to 89% on USPS Priority Mail® services, 77% on UPS® ground, 83% on UPS® International services, and many other shipping services.Create A Shipping and Fulfillment Workflow\\nWhen you ship multiple packages per day, a fine-tuned shipping strategy is essential.For any business, time is money.And a good shipping and fulfillment workflow saves you a lot of time.As mentioned above, ShipStation simplifies shipping by offering rate shopping options that let you pick the best shipping services for any given package.But we also offer automation processes that apply these shipping services as soon as an order comes into ShipStation.Cheapest Shipping Options Based on Delivery Time\\nDifferent services ensure delivery within specific timeframes.From economy to express, providing customers with affordable shipping options requires merchants to also save money.These are the preferred services for some common delivery timeframes.Cheapest Standard and 3-Day Shipping Options\\nStandard shipping options can vary based on a number of factors.For instance, if a parcel weighs under 16 oz, it’s likely you’re shipping it out with USPS First Class Mail®.But things begin to change when the weight goes up.Services like USPS Parcel Select® Ground take 2–8 days to reach the recipient and allow you to ship large parcels more affordably.Same goes with USPS Media Mail®.If you are sending approved materials, Media Mail is hard to beat.But other services like UPS® Ground, USPS Priority Mail®, and FedEx Ground® provide services that offer good ground shipping options.And depending on where they’re being shipped to, they may arrive sooner.UPS® Ground, for instance, may even arrive in as little as 24 hours.Cheapest Two-Day Shipping\\nTwo-day shipping options are very popular thanks to Amazon and other market leaders.Many consumers expect quicker delivery.ShipStation found that delivery speed is the second most important factor behind price for delivery options.There are many great 2-day shipping services.When you open a UPS account on ShipStation, you get discounts of up to 73% off UPS 2nd Day Air® service, 17% lower USPS Priority Mail Express rates, and 81% off DHL Express international services.Other 2-day shipping services include FedEx 2Day®.Cheapest Overnight Shipping\\nOvernight shipping is a premium shipping service, but there are ways to save.When you ship UPS on ShipStation, you get access to discounts on UPS Next Day Air® services.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"RJ44VbniaLV3YFBJ6LYAXliQfJFRlc+eXGzu7jjhUC4=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3038dcef-8a45-4c88-8c8e-07bd9c50eb1c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3038dcef-8a45-4c88-8c8e-07bd9c50eb1c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/cheapest-way-to-ship/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"23dcb940-93b9-4faa-a3d2-d86830dc9031\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/cheapest-way-to-ship/\"},\"hash\":\"PL1DKq1PuV920VrsCkJ+ieD/9jP4UD6CD5yRS8ulhWk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"dc70c141-5ff8-4959-b485-398018b282bb\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/cheapest-way-to-ship/\"},\"hash\":\"RJ44VbniaLV3YFBJ6LYAXliQfJFRlc+eXGzu7jjhUC4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b85b998d-ec60-46d6-b8ff-4dc20ce7d562\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"t876Lzr4078tAlrm4PzapR6SLhADW8ixdzxauxBe6wQ=\"}},\"text\":\"And

rates, and 81% off DHL Express international services.Other 2-day shipping services include FedEx 2Day®.Cheapest Overnight Shipping\\nOvernight shipping is a premium shipping service, but there are ways to save.When you ship UPS on ShipStation, you get access to discounts on UPS Next Day Air® services.There are also other great services that can deliver next day including FedEx Standard Overnight®.For even more premium overnight options, look for AM services.ShipStation offers the following services: \\nOvernight Shipping Service Next-Day Delivery Time\\nUPS Next Day Air Saver® Arrives by end of business day\\nUPS Next Day Air® Arrives next day by noon\\nUPS Next Day® Early Arrives by 8 am to major metro areas, 9–9:30 am in many cities\\nFedEx Standard Overnight® Arrives by end of business day\\nFedEx Priority Overnight Arrives by 10:30 am to commercial addresses and 4:30 pm for residential\\nFedEx First Overnight® Arrives by 10:00 am for most areas and between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm for extended areas.The Cheapest Shipping Insurance\\nA major way to pay less for insurance is to use a third-party insurance provider, such as Shipsurance.When adding insurance to a shipment you pay the additional fees in increments of $100 insured value.Typically, carriers charge between $0.75-0.85 per $100 value, with a minimum cost of roughly $2.50.Shipsurance, however, only charges $0.55 per $100, and with no minimum cost.So you can save big by using this third party insurance.Applying Shipsurance to a parcel and filing a claim is very streamlined through ShipStation.How to Ship a Package Based on Size\\nThe size of a parcel is going to greatly determine your shipping rate.The more space a package takes in the back of a truck, the fewer parcels the carrier can transport at once.One way to maintain steady shipping costs is to opt for Flat Rate packages.But since this will not always give you the lowest rate, let’s explore some more packaging options.How to Send a Small Package\\nFirst Class Mail offers amazing rates for small parcels under 16 oz.But UPS® Ground and USPS Priority Mail® have great rates too and deliver much more quickly.Small parcels weighing over 16 oz can be more affordable than you’d think with services like UPS® Ground.The Cheapest Way to Ship Large Packages \\nIf you are using ShipStation rates, UPS usually costs less than USPS for large or heavy parcels.UPS® Ground and USPS Priority Mail® are two commonly used services.But USPS Parcel Select® is another one to look for.If you use FedEx, FedEx® Ground is a good option.How to Find Cheaper Dimensional Weight Pricing\\nEven if a large parcel is lightweight, shipping it can be expensive.Large parcels cost more because of their dimensional weight.Dimensional weight is a pricing structure that increases the shipping rate if a parcel is deemed too large in relation to its weight—think things like a bike rim or a hula hoop.Since packages take up so much space in cargo vehicles and airplanes, etc., their shipping rate increases with their size.Carrier Domestic Dimensional Formula\\nUPS on ShipStation (L x W x H)/ 166\\nUSPS (L x W x H)/ 166\\nFedEx (L x W x H)/ 139\\nThe Cheapest Way to Ship Internationally\\nFor parcels weighing 4.4 lbs and under, USPS First Class Mail® International and GlobalPost Economy will be the most economical way to ship internationally.However, keep in mind that there are no requirements for estimated delivery time on this, so it may take weeks to arrive at its final destination.For quicker delivery—or for parcels weighing over 4.4 lbs—ShipStation offers discounts on GlobalPost and USPS.And when you ship UPS on ShipStation, you get access to discounts of up to 83% off UPS international services* and 81% off DHL Express international shipping as well!For more information on affordable international shipping, read our cheapest way to ship internationally

read our cheapest way to ship internationally blog.We also have guides discussing how to ship to places as nearby as Canada and as far away as China.Cheapest Shipping Options Based on Weight\\nSimilar to size, the weight of a parcel can greatly impact its rate.Since we’ve already discussed size-based pricing and dimensional weight pricing, let’s take a look at what the most cost-effective shipping service is based on different weight groups and cubic pricing.How to Ship Packages Under 1 LB\\nAgain, USPS First Class Mail® is usually considered the most affordable shipping option for parcels weighing under 16 ounces unless USPS Media Mail rates can apply.However, when you ship UPS on ShipStation, you get discounts of up to 77%* off UPS® Ground that make it an attractive alternative—especially if the parcel needs to be delivered quickly.How to Send a 5 lb Package\\nFor parcels between 1-5 lbs, UPS® Ground rates on ShipStation provide merchants with versatile nationwide coverage for parcels sent to any destination.Other domestic services to look at include USPS Priority Mail and Parcel Select.How to Mail Packages Weighing 10 LBs or More\\nUPS rates on ShipStation also offer a great option for domestic parcels over 10 lbs.There are always variables that change this, though, so it’s best to rate shop for the best option.An important factor in choosing a shipping service, particularly when shipping heavier parcels is the distance a package requires to be delivered.Distance also impacts shipping rates.Carriers break pricing down into shipping zones.Understanding how zone impacts shipping costs help you pay substantially less money on delivery.How Cubic Weight Impacts Pricing \\nSmaller parcels usually cost less to ship because of their small cubic weight.Luckily, Cubic weight can decrease the shipping cost for small, heavy packages!Cubic weight is what allows smaller parcels to cost less than large ones that have the same weight.ShipStation offers great rates for these smaller packages through both USPS and UPS.How to Offer Customers the Cheapest Shipping Rates\\nFinding ways to make shipping more affordable for your customers means you’re less likely to see cart abandonment.ShipStation makes shipping much more affordable—allowing you to pass the savings on to your customers.Offer Checkout Shipping Rates\\nOne way to capitalize on the affordable rates available in ShipStation is to use In-Cart Delivery Options.This exposes live rates to your customers in checkout.Fears of overcharging or undercharging can be a huge pain point for many ecommerce merchants.ShipStation lets Shopify, Wix, Magento, and BigCommerce merchants provide live-rate shipping options to their customers during checkout.These can be adjusted to include or decrease based on dollar amounts or percentages.Offer Free Shipping for Cheaper\\nTypically you don’t want shipping to eat into more than 10-20% of your profit margins.A good way to offset free shipping costs is to incorporate shipping costs into the item cost.Merchants commonly utilize this method when selling through marketplaces like Amazon—since they require free shipping options for qualified orders.However, if you add too much of the shipping cost into the item price, you run the risk of losing more customers than if you charged separately for shipping.As a result, there are always factors to keep in mind when planning a pricing and shipping policy.Offer Flat-Fee Shipping for Cheaper\\nFlat-fee shipping is a common practice for many merchants.One reason this option is so common is that it keeps prices stable.Surprises during checkout can deter customers.Flat-fee shipping allows you to cover shipping costs while making shipping cost low for customers.Knowing that shipping will cost $5 before placing an order is a lot less surprising then seeing an added $5 appear in checkout.Offer Free Shipping Above a Threshold \\nA common practice of “having your cake and eating it too” is to offer free shipping above a certain price.This is commonly used in conjunction with flat-fee shipping.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"HCrtiiPS4mjkV0LUxyWWgIgqGQ7AubwXoiHx8s+hY+k=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3d89a3cc-bcda-47dd-856b-7f830d4fec47":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3d89a3cc-bcda-47dd-856b-7f830d4fec47\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/cheapest-way-to-ship/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"23dcb940-93b9-4faa-a3d2-d86830dc9031\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/cheapest-way-to-ship/\"},\"hash\":\"PL1DKq1PuV920VrsCkJ+ieD/9jP4UD6CD5yRS8ulhWk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"b85b998d-ec60-46d6-b8ff-4dc20ce7d562\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/cheapest-way-to-ship/\"},\"hash\":\"t876Lzr4078tAlrm4PzapR6SLhADW8ixdzxauxBe6wQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e6e76f24-da57-4add-994a-1c37ef8d71b6\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"HFdhKzD4gKMFVyZhQ8/gizq7B+1bndPhmUoT6Z67eNM=\"}},\"text\":\"However,

shipping above a certain price.This is commonly used in conjunction with flat-fee shipping.The way it works is to charge a single rate for shipping for any order (domestic, usually) below a price threshold.For instance: “$10 shipping for all orders under $75.”If the order total exceeds $75, shipping is free.Many companies incentivize larger purchases by offering free shipping above this threshold.Where to Find the Best Shipping Rates and Carrier Discounts\\nShipStation offers discounts on a range of carriers and label providers.While we’ve gone over many of these already, it’s always

Do I Calculate Shipping Costs and Charge Customers?Knowing what to charge customers requires you to calculate shipping costs and determine the best carrier services for each order.There are a few things that go into shipping costs and what to charge.These are some of the things to be aware of when shipping online orders.How do I calculate shipping costs?From weight, dimensions, destinations, additional surcharges, and more options, shipping costs have a lot of factors.There are very few flat rate shipping options.Let’s go over some of the most common things that influence shipping costs.Weight\\nA package’s weight is a major deciding factor in a shipping carrier’s base rate.Typically, each new pound increases the shipping cost.While there are factors such as dimensions and shipping zones, it is usually weight that determines which shipping service to use.Dimensions\\nDimensions play a big part in shipping costs.Typically, a package’s dimensions don’t increase the rate to a new threshold.Rather, dimensions are more of a limiting factor—if you exceed a carrier’s maximum dimensions, it is subject to an additional handling surcharge.Destinations and Shipping Zone\\nShipping zones are what carriers use to determine the distance between the origin and destination addresses of a domestic package.This distance is ranked in levels of 1-9.If the distance is a 1, or local, this is the shortest distance.Meanwhile, 9 is the furthest distance—overseas territories.Keep in mind, though, that international rates are determined a bit differently, though.Surcharges\\nSurcharges increase shipping costs for customers and merchants alike.Surcharges are more common with carriers that post-bill, such as FedEx and UPS.These generally include additional fees for things like extended area delivery surcharges (a home in a more remote location) or residential surcharges.How UPS, FedEx, and USPS Treat Weight and Dimensions\\nUSPS Maximum Dimensions and Weight\\nThe USPS’ has a slightly smaller allowable maximum size than other carriers.Domestic pieces may not measure more than 108 inches in length and girth combined and 70 lbs in max weight.Oversized USPS parcels will have a $100 fee applied to them.FedEx Maximum Dimensions and Weight\\nWith FedEx Ground® and FedEx Home Delivery® Services, you can ship packages up to 150 lbs; up to 108″ in length, and 165″ in length plus girth.An oversized surcharge of $52.50 applies to all FedEx parcels exceeding these size and weight limits.UPS Maximum Dimensions and Weight\\nUPS allows packages up to 150 lbs with a maximum size of 165 inches in length and girth combined.An oversize surcharge of between $95-$115 will be applied to all UPS parcels exceeding these weight and size limits.Cubic Rates\\nCubic rates help make smaller, heavier parcels more affordable.Cubic rates are determined by a formula.Highly discounted rates for high-volume shippers for packages under 20lbs that are no larger than .5 cubic feet.Cubic Feet Formula\\nLength x Width x Height / 1728 = Cubic Feet\\nWhile ShipStation doesn’t offer full Cubic pricing, we do offer discounted cubic rates for any customer through our relationship with Stamps.com.Dimensional Weight\\nDimensional weight is the exact opposite of cubic rates.Instead of charging you less for small, heavy parcels.You get charged MORE for big, lightweight parcels.So, a can of chili and a pillow that have the same weight could have different shipping rates.The Dimensional formula\\nCarrier Domestic Dimensional Formula\\nUPS (L x W x H)/ 139\\nFedEx (L x W x H)/ 139\\nUSPS (L x W x H)/ 166\\nWhichever value weighs more between this outcome (the actual weight or the dimensional weight) will be what determines the shipping rate for the weight.How to Calculate USPS shipping cost\\nCalculating USPS shipping costs is generally more straightforward than UPS or FedEx.The rates don’t increase based on Saturday delivery or residential surcharges.Since USPS charges upon creation for a label, all fees are usually included in the initial cost.How to Calculate FedEx shipping cost\\nFedEx has more surcharges and factors to consider than USPS.For instance, FedEx has surcharges that can increase the price by a substantial amount.Things like residential surcharges and fuel surcharges may not be fully calculated until after an item is delivered.Shipping rates you’re quoted at the time of label creation may not accurately reflect the final shipping costs.For instance, the residential surcharge may not be applied when you use FedEx’s rate calculator.If your recipient is residential, use FedEx Home® delivery.This residential surcharge also allows for Saturday delivery at no extra cost.So the shipping cost you charge customers may need to be adjusted slightly.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"/tSTkMcSLPaouayegdcSlrUb8rbL1M2kZ5jPcsgKQhk=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5331d881-c474-45f4-a64c-5751760da7cd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5331d881-c474-45f4-a64c-5751760da7cd\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-do-i-calculate-shipping-costs-and-charge-customers/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"d4ab1d2e-cad6-4b54-88bf-c91d672be2a2\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-do-i-calculate-shipping-costs-and-charge-customers/\"},\"hash\":\"3ex3kHK9IctnizXMBgyI0xeomMfzQKH/K1Mqiruf46Q=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"c8850ccc-4440-4cf6-aabd-7d92c375b30a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-do-i-calculate-shipping-costs-and-charge-customers/\"},\"hash\":\"/tSTkMcSLPaouayegdcSlrUb8rbL1M2kZ5jPcsgKQhk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e7972fa3-38c8-4382-866f-359d3431135c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"ecKhfRSc4LKkShb7El2g3CkCzJ6TPx8vCwK5kAk6GNw=\"}},\"text\":\"How to Calculate USPS shipping cost\\nCalculating USPS shipping costs is generally more straightforward than UPS or FedEx.The rates don’t increase based on Saturday delivery or residential

avoid some of these surcharges and get more affordable UPS shipping rates, ShipStation’s integration with UPS offers cheaper shipping rates with fewer surcharges than you’d find with a standalone UPS account—which ShipStation also supports.How To Charge For Shipping\\nCustomers have eased up a bit on shipping timeframes and demanding free shipping.However, demand for clearly communicated shipping times and simple pricing structures has become stronger.For the most information about how customers prefer shipping, download ShipStation’s research guide that goes into detail about shipping expectations.To save on shipping your parcels as well as everything else, sign up for ShipStation to see how cheap shipping can be.How to Charge For Shipping on Etsy\\nEtsy makes charging shipping costs pretty easy.Since Etsy requires free shipping on orders over $35 for merchants participating in the free shipping guarantee, you may need to find cheap shipping options.Since customers are more likely to purchase from merchants offering free shipping, having an affordable shipping solution is key.Furthermore, you can inject some of the shipping costs into the item cost to increase cart conversions.How to Charge For Shipping on Amazon\\nAmazon is among the most rigid places to sell on—particularly if you want to become a Prime seller or to get the featured offer.Furthermore, offering free shipping is essential to being Prime or featured.Free shipping is a tad easier to offer if you can inject some of the shipping costs into the item’s price.However, this can be risky as you don’t want to be costlier than the featured seller.Many sellers cite Amazon as being a great place to get the word out about their products.With their rigid packaging guidelines and customer-centric returns strategy, some sellers just use Amazon as a marketplace for their lower-cost items with more affordable shipping prices.How to Charge For Shipping on eBay\\neBay has a few shipping guidelines to be aware of.For instance, you MUST use a shipping service with tracking.You also can’t use a slower shipping method than what the customer selects.Apart from this, there aren’t many rules.Shipping costs can be determined with the Ebay rate calculator.You may also use ShipStation’s USPS postage calculator to get a good idea of the rates available.How to Charge for Shipping on Your Website\\nIf you have your own website on platforms like Wix.com, Shopify, or WooCommerce, it is usually simplest to adopt some of the more favorable shipping options from your marketplace platforms.We found that 78% of customers have become more willing to shop from a small retailer than they were before COVID-19.So, this is a good time to move off of a marketplace and open your own store.But, the important thing to keep in mind is that customers do have expectations of quick delivery.So, if you can ship out items within 24 hours, offer affordable shipping costs, and send shipping confirmation emails in a timely manner, you should be good!Let’s go over how to determine these shipping costs.To start saving on shipping costs, sign up for a free ShipStation trial today!How Much to Charge For Domestic Shipping\\nDomestic shipping is usually pretty straightforward.You’ll find the shipping services that work best for your different items and regions of the country.The problem with domestic shipping is knowing what to charge.There are a few options that work well.Some are better for your customers and some are better for the merchant.Offer Flat-Fee Shipping\\nFlat-fee shipping doesn’t require you use USPS Flat Rate boxes.However, this could be a good option if your parcels are heavy as it is the same rate as long as a parcel is under 70 lbs.This is especially good considering FedEx and UPS tend to be more affordable over about 6 lbs.Flat-rate shipping is a good idea because customers don’t like surprises.This is why places like Amazon are so popular.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"jX1x8EkB1W3Q9Gphj9XNq2Md0Aj2Ay0SsmeGyBAiSMY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e7972fa3-38c8-4382-866f-359d3431135c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e7972fa3-38c8-4382-866f-359d3431135c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-do-i-calculate-shipping-costs-and-charge-customers/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"d4ab1d2e-cad6-4b54-88bf-c91d672be2a2\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-do-i-calculate-shipping-costs-and-charge-customers/\"},\"hash\":\"3ex3kHK9IctnizXMBgyI0xeomMfzQKH/K1Mqiruf46Q=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5331d881-c474-45f4-a64c-5751760da7cd\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipstation.com/blog/how-do-i-calculate-shipping-costs-and-charge-customers/\"},\"hash\":\"oABaqWssuAbcoeUuwHMrgU9LOHvaHmGccA9wDzJ0KMM=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"43985e56-5ced-4583-90d7-f055cddc3943\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"wFTJJ3lFn9ptRgPaFErBZW+kGVEqoltAWPKeut8UZkE=\"}},\"text\":\"Let’s

shipping is a good idea on your own website because it allows you to appear organized and in control of your shipping volume.Having different shipping rates for different items may be a good way to protect your profit margins, but it is less likely to result in an order being placed.Using something like “shipping is $4.99 for items under $75.”is a good way to get cart conversions while also incentivizing them to reach a threshold for free shipping.Why Charging Threshold Shipping Works\\nThreshold shipping is very common.It allows customers to get free shipping if they place an order above a certain cost.Generally, it’s just north of your average order total.This can be a way to get another item added to the cart.Advertising high-profit margin items that cost under about $20 can be an easy way to reduce surplus inventory as well as increase profits.Customers Prefer Free Shipping\\nObviously, free is king.If you can offer free shipping by injecting a little bit of the shipping cost into the item, do that.Our research study found that 56% of Americans expect free shipping in order to place an order.If you want to make these sales, you have to accept that your profit margin will narrow.Threshold shipping can be a way to get the best of both worlds, though.How Much to Charge For International Shipping \\nInternational shipping is an entirely separate beast.It can be confusing, expensive, and an insufferably long ordeal to get international customers their orders.Free shipping is almost always off the table, even to nearby countries like Canada.Flat-fee shipping to certain countries is usually the best way to go as far as cart conversions go, but shipping fees can vary wildly from country to country.So it may be best to have rules set up to determine how much to add for shipping depending on the destination country.Shopify has a thorough tutorial on selling and shipping internationally that has plenty of good information.But let’s get into some of the finer points of shipping internationally that can become an expensive surprise for you and your customers.How Customs and Taxes Raise Shipping Costs\\nCustoms fees and import taxes can rack up quickly.And while it’s common for your customers to pay these import taxes, you may choose to pay them.And this can become a costly process.For instance, shipping to Europe has just become more expensive since VAT taxes apply to all international orders—not just those valued at over $22.Luckily, programs like the IOSS allow you to pay these fees instead of your customers for orders up to $150.Even if you charge customers based on these additional surcharges, it is easier than having to have them deal with it.Again, taxes and customs fees make international shipping very expensive.And the difficulties don’t end with it being more expensive.What happens if an item is rejected or undeliverable?Return to Sender vs Treat as Abandoned\\nWhen an item can not make final delivery to an international customer, you’re left with the decision to just scrap the item or to have it shipped back to you.Remember, once an item clears customs, those charges may still need to be paid, even once they’re returned.This can cause the final shipping charges to be far higher than the item cost.At this point, it may just be easier to just treat the item as abandoned.These are shipping options that you can configure.But, it is important to remember that regardless of which option you choose, you should charge international customers accordingly.How ShipStation Helps Reduce Shipping Costs\\nShipStation is a great tool for understanding shipping costs.With all your orders laid out regardless of order source, with the ability to compare different services and choose carriers based

once an item clears customs, those charges may still need to be paid, even once they’re returned.This can cause the final shipping charges to be far higher than the item cost.At this point, it may just be easier to just treat the item as abandoned.These are shipping options that you can configure.But, it is important to remember that regardless of which option you choose, you should charge international customers accordingly.How ShipStation Helps Reduce Shipping Costs\\nShipStation is a great tool for understanding shipping costs.With all your orders laid out regardless of order source,

Tools\\nE-commerce management\\n17 February 2023\\nAgnieszka Łepkowska\\nShare\\nE-commerce businesses are facing increasingly complex and competitive markets, making it essential to have the right tools in place to optimize operations and stay ahead of the competition.Automation is a powerful way to streamline processes, reduce costs, and increase efficiency, freeing up time and resources to focus on growth and customer satisfaction.In this article, we will explore some of the top e-commerce automation tools available to help you optimize your e-commerce business and stay on top of things.Contents\\n1 Automate your marketing efforts with e-mail campaigns and social media scheduling tools\\n2 Use order management software to streamline the fulfillment process and track inventory levels\\n3 Integrate a payment gateway to automate transactions and reduce processing fees\\n4 Utilize shipping software to get real-time shipping quotes, track packages, and automate customs

marketing efforts with e-mail campaigns and social media scheduling tools\\nE-mail campaigns and social media scheduling tools can help you save time and effort by allowing you to plan and execute your marketing activities in advance.With e-mail campaigns, you can create and send automated e-mails to your subscribers based on certain triggers, such as signing up for your newsletter or making a purchase.You can also segment your e-mail list to personalize the messaging and make it more relevant to each recipient.Social media scheduling tools allow you to pre-schedule posts for your social media accounts.This means you can create and publish content in advance, ensuring that your social media presence remains active even when you are not able to be online.These tools also often provide analytics, so you can see how your content is performing and make any necessary adjustments.However, it is important to remember that automation should be used to augment your marketing efforts, not replace them entirely.Personal interaction and human touch are still important for building relationships with your audience and creating a strong brand.Mailchimp is one of the most popular automation tools for e-mail campaigns and social media scheduling.It is widely used by small businesses, freelancers, and larger organizations due to its user-friendly interface, range of features, and
