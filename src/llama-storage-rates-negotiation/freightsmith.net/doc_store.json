According to Khaled Naim, co-founder and CEO of Onfleet, both delivery and online sales continue to grow despite inflation. Food-at-home prices increased more than 13% over the past 12 months, marking the largest 12-month increase in 43 years. Though consumer price sensitivity is at an all-time high, Americans have become dependent on online ordering and delivery services for staple consumer goods because of the convenience and added health safety. So, as we hopefully near a post-pandemic era, what will the future hold for the last mile? • Demand for faster, more streamlined last-mile grocery delivery will continue to grow as consumer expectations rise. • Ease of scalability will be key to grocer success with last-mile delivery. • Grocers will leverage delivery management technology to make delivery a competitive advantage. • Modernization of the last mile will become a reality as more grocers begin their digital transformation. As last-mile delivery becomes essential to consumers, the cost of inaction in the grocery delivery market will be steep.

These disruptions could have extended beyond the rail sector itself, and affected other transportation modes, primarily trucking, according to Uber Freight, who estimates that even if 20% of rail freight shifted to trucking, spot rates could’ve doubled in just that short period of time. “As we’ve learned from the past two years, the truckload market is very sensitive to disruptions in supply and demand. While spot rates react quickly to such changes, contract rates lag by a few months. Therefore, a disruption of this magnitude would have a direct impact on spot rates,” according to Uber Freight. Data indicates that the average weight of a carload is 128,000 pounds and that of an intermodal load is 33,000 pounds. According to the Commodity Flow Survey, rail carries about the same amount of freight as for-hire truckloads (measured in ton-miles). When excluding local hauls (less than 100 miles) and light loads (less than 10,000 pounds, which are likely LTL shipments), rail carries 33% more freight than long-distance for-hire truckloads. Total emissions produced by all the truckload freight and 20% of the served rail freight would have increased by 19%.

Yet, despite the emerging complexities of this new trucking industry landscape, cold chain stakeholders have access to data analytics, tools and services to help them maintain their strict quality standards, according to Doug Thurston, VP of sales, cold chain digital solutions at Emerson.\\nMost importantly, data provides an objective record of cold chain temperatures in-transit. In challenging times like these, where truckers and retailers simply can’t afford the negative impacts of rejected loads, data serves as an arbiter of supply chain disputes. It takes emotion out of the equation by providing indisputable proof of precisely when and where temperature excursions occur.

Develop new plan. Implement new process. Execute. New disruption occurs. Pivot again. Rinse and repeat.\\nAt some point, when is the “New Normal” not so new? At what point does the New Normal become Old News? Begs the question of, what does a normal supply chain really even look like?\\nIs it disruption-proof? Is it cybersecurity-safe? Is it running on all cylinders with a full staff? Is it equipped with all the latest tools and technologies? Is it automated, cloud-based or hands-free?\\nBetter yet, does this so-called “normal” supply chain even exist?\\nPrior to 2019, nearly all supply chains were considered normal. They operated the same way, day in and day out, with only a few hiccups here and there.\\nPost-pandemic though, normal has been redefined to better suit the nature of how supply chains operate in a disruption-laden environment.\\nNatural disasters, port strikes, rail strikes, worker shortages, inflation and risk continue to present bottlenecks in all facets of the supply chain, leading some to believe that the logistics space may never achieve normalcy again.\\nCase in point: Nearly 45% of economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal estimated bottlenecks would ease by the second half of 2022. Yet, here we are, about to turn the page to 2023, and the supply chain still seems anything but normal.\\nChina, for example, continues to enforce a zero-COVID-19 policy “that can partially or fully lock down major cities like Chengdu, Shenzhen, Xian, or Shanghai,” says Mirko Woitzik, global director, intelligence solutions at Everstream Analytics. “While this persists, we will continue to see port, airport and city shutdowns, as well as extended travel bans, which will impact supply chain logistics.”\\n“The global economic slowdown and rising inflation rates will also create workforce and labor issues within the supply chain. This will add financial pressure to many parts of the supply chain that are still reeling from the impacts of COVID-19 coupled with the war in Ukraine. Cost-cutting measures will likely increase labor shortages in critical parts of the supply chain from food production to ports and railways, which have the potential to cause further turmoil,” adds Woitzik.\\nOther factors such as inflation and rising fuel costs, to name a few, continue to put a strain on the supply chain.\\nOn the other hand though, several industry leaders detail how this return to normalcy may not be as far-fetched in 2023 as currently perceived, but it will still be very different from prepandemic.\\nSupply chains are unlikely to stabilize until first half of 2024 and beyond, while 22% expect disruptions to continue until the second half of 2023, according to a Carl Marks Advisors survey.\\nIn a separate report, Citi economists said logistics pressures from excessive consumer demand for goods are easing up, yet companies shouldn’t consider an “all clear” just yet.\\nThe physical shortage of capacity, which drives up freight rates, doesn’t seem to be an issue at this time, according to SeaIntelligence, with models suggesting that a return to “normal” at a 2% capacity loss baseline by early 2023 is possible.\\n“In supply chain circles battered by more than two years of upheaval, the word ‘normal’ is creeping into the outlook for 2023. From the Logistics Managers’ Index to the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, we’re seeing forecasters more optimistic about the future outlook,” says Ben Harris, senior managing director, client solutioning and strategy at Cushman & Wakefield. “And while we’re optimistic that they’re right, we continue to see continuing challenges around raw materials and labor shortages, which are unchanged since last year at this time. Hopefully things will start to substantially ease by summer 2023, but it is going to be bumpy and uneven.”\\nIn order to obtain somewhat of a normal way of doing business, companies must adhere to a New Normal, but in a way that’s defined as new on a regular basis. Think of it as an alternate state of the supply chain, where the timeline has skewed to create a new supply chain space [Back to the Future fans, anyone?]. This new continuum is laden with bottlenecks, strikes and challenges never before experienced.\\nAnd, it’s all happening at once. And, it’s all normal.\\n“Instability and disruption are the New Normal. We must acknowledge the inevitable and shift our focus not only to building more adaptive, responsive and resilient supply chains, but addressing the systemic factors that contribute to ongoing risks and rising costs,” says Tom Madrecki, VP of supply chain and logistics, Consumer Brands Association.\\nRail strike strikes back\\nIn early October, U.S. supply chains dodged a rail strike, one that would’ve embargoed shipments and further crippled global supply chains. President Biden enforced a 60-day cooling off period, where the Presidential Emergency Board looked at the disputed issues in the negotiations and issued a recommended settlement. These disruptions could have extended beyond the rail sector itself, and affected other transportation modes, primarily trucking, according to Uber Freight, who estimated that even if 20% of rail freight shifted to trucking, spot rates could’ve doubled in just that short period of time. Fast forward a month later, and rail workers continue to express concern over their current labor contracts. Analysts say a possible next shutdown could “hamper passenger service and slow the flow of goods to stores and warehouses. A union strike could cost the U.S. economy up to $2 billion per day, according to an estimate from the Association of American Railroads. Roughly 40% of the nation’s long-distance trade is moved by rail—more than any form\\n@Kalyakan.stock.adobe.com of transportation—and a union strike could stop more than 7,000 trains from operating,” according to Time.com.\\nInstabilities in this sector are projected to continue for the next couple of years.\\nProblems at the port\\nThen there’s problems at the port, which didn’t just happen overnight and certainly didn’t start when the EVER GIVEN got stuck in the Suez Canal.\\nThe backlog of inventory compounded with the oversupply of containers is contributing to second-hand container market prices plummeting, according to analysis from Container xChange.\\n“The current situation of oversupply of containers is a result of a series of reactionary market disruptions that began soon after the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020. With the rise in demand, congestion at ports increased and the container capacity was held up for a considerably long period of time. This led to the panic ordering of new boxes at record levels. With time, as markets reopen and demand softens, the oversupply is a natural outcome of demand-supply forces\\nWith inflation and lockdowns, disruptions will continue to change the equation between supply, demand and prices.\\nbalancing at new levels,” says Christian Roeloffs, co-founder and CEO of Container xChange.\\nDisrupting 2023\\nCurrently the industry is faced with several disruptions.\\nFor starters, the Russia-Ukraine war doesn’t seem to be ending any time soon.\\n“Russia cutting off gas supplies to many parts of Europe is greatly affecting the price of energy in Europe. Currently, Europe is facing 10% inflation as of September 2022. We will likely see inflation soar even further during the winter months. The increase in costs has resulted in companies in Europe either shifting their production to other parts of the world or reducing their output. In some cases, companies that cannot afford it had to close, or stop production entirely. These problems will not be an overnight fix and will surely continue to be an issue into the new year,” says Woitzik.\\nHeightened financial volatility, sustainable development divestment, complex global supply chain reconfigurations and mounting trade costs stemming from the war in Ukraine continue to impact trade and development, according to a new study released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\\n“Soaring food and fuel prices will affect the most vulnerable in developing countries, putting pressure on the poorest households, which spend the highest share of their income on food, resulting in hardship and hunger,” says UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan.\\nIn fact, “the biggest trend to watch has to be the slowdown in the growth of global trade. Between 2005-2019, there was an 84% increase in global trade. Obviously, the pandemic had an immediate and (so far) lasting impact on that growth.

They can even track where their items are throughout the process until it arrives. This type of expectation of visibility and expediency is going to increase across the supply chain,” says Jennifer Karpus-Romain, executive director for Transportation Marketing & Sales Association (TMSA).\\nThe availability of ingredients and shortages in some food products continue to challenge the food sector, specifically the frozen food category.\\n“Manufacturers may still need to reformulate or make labeling changes in response to ingredient shortages. The frozen food industry in particular is facing the diversion of soy and canola oil to make biofuels for government transportation subsidies and manufacturers face crisis-level shortages in edible vegetable oil for producing many frozen foods,” says Alison Bodor, president and CEO at American Frozen Food Institute (AFFI).\\nFurthermore, other disruptions such as inflation and labor shortages continue to put a damper on the industry.\\n“The trucking industry is already plagued with driver shortages. Warehouses faced similar issues earlier this year and last year. Staffing complexities and labor shortages will be an ongoing trend next year as well,” says Adhish Luitel, senior analyst, ABI Research. “Inflation has grown rapidly this year globally and a lot of regions in the world are now dealing with the highest level of inflation in years. Businesses must be prepared for cost increases related to procurement, finished products, wages, transportation\\nDusan Kostic - stock.adobe.com\\nfees, storage space rent and more. Coping with inflation and trying to minimize its impact would entail fixing a lot of inefficiencies across supply chains.”\\nAnd, it’s those inefficiencies that could pose disruptions all on their own.\\n“As we approach the end of 2022 and enter 2023, I anticipate a state of continued supply chain instability and disruptions for the next year, if not longer. Consequently, issues of accuracy in demand forecasting will continue to be a major pain point for retailers,” says Troy Prothero, SVP, product management, supply chain solutions, SymphonyAI Retail CPG. “From changes in purchasing and consumption patterns that resulted from the past two years to inflation and geopolitical events, all of these factors combined create a perfect storm for supply chain disruption. What’s more, retailers can no longer rely solely on historical demand data as a basis for forecasting.”\\n“As a result, retailers must look to their demand forecasting technologies and ensure predictions are as agile, data-driven, science-based and accurate as possible,” Prothero says. “In addition, it’s crucial to proactively look at scenarios that might occur and plan how to act ahead of time, rather than just react to them.”\\nIndustry experts offer hope to a return to normalcy in the supply chain space, but it will be a new normalcy of sorts and be quite the bumpy ride in getting there.\\n“We are right back to a threatened supply chain because we have not had the time to catch up and build needed resiliency,” Madrecki says. But, by closing the labor gaps, implementing the right technology, hitting some sustainability marks and overcoming disruptions, the New Normal will be the only way to operate going forward.\\nSCAN QR CODE\\nFor the complete article\\nDEDICATED.

In the current job market, the winners are those who see the opportunity to invest in systems that require low human interaction. And even when human operators are required, the ergonomics of the system will determine the turnover rate.\\nMontana-based Doyles Sheehan, a leading distributor to convenience stores, capitalized on the opportunity to reinvent the order fulfillment process. They teamed up with Velociti Alliance North America, a technology leader for optimized order fulfillment solutions, to convert their warehouses from single-order picking to hybrid order/batch picking. While some areas of the warehouse are picked one order at a time, most areas benefit from batch-oriented picking and sorting, where one pass through inventory fills an entire truckload of orders.\\nThrough analysis and simulation of the Doyles Sheehan order history using 3-D models, Velociti was able to take their pick rate from 400 to 750 pieces per hour per employee. “Not only did the Velociti partnership significantly decrease our labor requirement, but we also increased throughput and accuracy with minimal training. The bottom-line addition to profit is significant,” says Pat Coulter, Director of Operations and Information Systems.\\nUsing wearable technology, handsfree order selection, and cloud-based order optimization, Coulter has been able to achieve top-tier results without spending millions of dollars in automation. With Velociti, Doyles Sheehan has created more ergonomic jobs for a smaller staff of dedicated employees – people they can keep, because the work is manageable. With the labor savings, Coulter has been able to create incentives for highperforming associates, recognizing them for their dedication and ensuring that they stay engaged with the company for years to come.\\nFor more information, head over to https://velocitialliance.com.\\nTRENDS IN COLD CHAIN\\nIf you had to choose a theme for 2022, its likely you would point toward supply chain disruption. For third-party logistics (3PL) providers who saw soaring rates and strong demand over the past two years, the market remains favorable long-term, but 2023 will look very different with a double-digit decline in revenues as the market normalizes, says Evan Armstrong, president of Armstrong & Associates.\\nAnd while all signs point to a more stable market following the last few years of uncertainty, 3PLs are still likely to feel the impacts of that “new normal.”\\n1. Shippers are demanding a higher service level\\nIndustry growth and increased service levels are the two biggest trends to look for in 2023, according to Chris Wilson, VP of business development at TA Services.\\n“Because 2021-22 was kind of a recovery period of getting out of the supply chain and COVID nightmares, now we are seeing more companies move from being reactive to be more proactive,” says Wilson. “We are seeing a lot of companies working a lot more with third parties, doing an integration of their\\n@iQoncept.stock.adobe.com\\nWhile all signs point to a more stable market following the last few years of uncertainty, 3PLs are still likely to feel the impacts of a New Normal.\\nsupply chain with a third-party company as far as its transportation, its warehousing, its final mile, everything. Companies are relying on 3PLs a lot more than they used to.”\\nShippers are also looking for proactive ideas from 3PLs to improve operations and reduce costs, says Armstrong, and that “3PL customers have evolved from wanting basic transportation and warehouse management skills to more strategic relationships. They are also looking at 3PLs for business continuity management and are seeking well-positioned 3PLs which can even operate in cases of disasters. Some customers are asking 3PLs to present their internal plans for labor shortages, disaster preparedness, work stoppage, weather-related transportation disruptions, technology outages and other risks to operations.” Wilson notes that it’s no longer just about price, but what you can bring to the table. “It’s about positioning yourself to have the most options and the best options,” he explains. Drew Herpich, chief commercial officer at Nolan Transportation Group and Transportation Insight, attributes the continued growth in the 3PL market to a level playing field. “People are now starting to accept brokers on the same level as assets. Brokers for so long got a bad name out in the industry, and shippers have realized, especially after COVID, that brokers have similar capabilities as these assets do,” Herpich adds.\\n2. 3PLs must be flexible\\nShippers are also looking for 3PLs that have the flexibility to bend and sway as the market changes. “You can no\\n Cold chain and dry warehousing capacity\\nis tight and will continue to be a challenge throughout 2023.\\nlonger take the approach of, ‘this is who we are, and this is how we do it.’ You have to be able to pivot and adjust to each individual customer,” Wilson explains.\\nHe adds that shippers are looking for an “elastic logistics plan,” with a partner “that can look at the overall picture and offer options.”\\nThis type of flexibility requires IT integration with transparency and visibility into both yours and your customers’ systems, “so that they’re able to know in real-time everything that is going on with their supply chain and that the 3PL is handling it,” says Wilson.\\n3. A continued crunch on warehouse capacity\\nCold chain and dry warehousing capacity is tight and will continue to be a challenge throughout 2023 as shippers look to 3PLs to find space and manage operations.\\n“Finding and managing warehouse and\\n@bnenin.stock.adobe.com\\ntransportation labor is another challenge and risk that is being passed on to 3PLs,” explains Armstrong.\\nWilson says that 3PLs are being asked to take more product in and have more stock available, so if and when there are supply chain disruptions, the stock is readily available. However, this has created a major crunch on warehousing space.\\nIn response, Herpich predicts the industry will see an increase in mergers and acquisitions this year among the biggest players.\\n“Being able to build or get the equipment or space to be able to build these refrigerated solutions is going to be tougher. To get the on-demand warehousing, you’re going to see a lot more M&A deals going down,” he says.\\n4. Labor shortage is growing\\nWilson says a labor shortage across the supply chain is likely to be an even bigger problem for 3PLs this year.\\nAccording to an annual study by NTT\\nFROMVINETOMARKET\\nGetting perishables to the market in excellent condition is a tough job. But with our help, it’s a little easier. With a fleet of more than1,40053-foot refrigerated trailers and containers,Alliance Shippers Inc. has the capacity to manage the largest protective-service tasks.

This also tracks with the findings in the study, which found 84% of 3PLs and 70% of shippers are either actively implementing or researching and reviewing augmenting their supply chain operations with new technology and/or automation to offset talent shortage.\\n5. Rates will trend downward\\nRecipient of Food Logistics’ 2022 Top Software & Technology Providers Award\\nEnd-to-End Visibility Shipper - Carrier Matching\\nAs disruptions in the supply chain continue to resolve, Wilson predicts rates trending downward. While general freight volume is currently muted and rates for most modes are down significantly from the first half of 2022, Armstrong says more historically normal transportation rates and demand levels should progress into 2023.\\nThis means that price will no longer be the biggest differentiator in a competitive 3PL landscape.\\n“When you’re looking to work with a new customer, everyone’s rates are going down into the ground right now. Its more about providing a service level and finding other services that provide a value-add for the customer,” Wilson says.\\nTo that point, Armstrong says that value-added warehousing and distribution will continue to do well given the general lack of warehousing space, which is nearing a critical level in the cold chain and strong growth in e-commerce fulfillment and last-mile delivery.\\nReal-Time Tracking\\nAutomation & Efficiency Instant Reports\\nCustomer Support & Relationship\\nJoin Our Community WWW.LANEZ.COM\\n6. Digital freight matching takes focus\\nDigital freight matching will continue to pick up speed in 2023, with an increased focus on the automation of freight brokerage. This process automates traditional spot-market freight brokerage sales functions, and according to Armstrong, is increasing shippers’ use of more spot vs. contract pricing.\\n“The ongoing digitalization of transactional truckload freight brokerage continues at a rapid pace as more 3PLs have built API integrations to large shippers’ transportation management systems for truckload spot-market rate quoting and automated load tendering and booking,” says Armstrong, adding that it has become a competitive differentiator as 3PLs look to increase the number of loads and shipments they manage per person per day and revenue per person per year.\\n7. Sustainability will demand a bigger role\\nSustainability will also be top of mind for many 3PLs this year. “The solutions that we see today have not been exactly environmentally friendly or sustainable long term. You’re going to see much more sustainable solutions come to the forefront,” Herpich says. Wilson points to green initiatives in the warehouse, specifically mentioning major grocery chains who in recent years have announced plans to reduce emissions, cut their carbon footprints and create greater efficiencies in the warehouse. Lighting and temperature control are the two biggest areas companies are focusing on in the warehouse, with energy efficiency found through LED lights, skylights, sensors that monitor usage and turn off lights when not in use and highefficiency HVAC systems.\\n8. Innovative cold storage solutions are needed\\nAs warehouse capacity continues to tighten, Herpich says 3PLs will need to get more creative in keeping products cold.\\n“You are going to see people get more and more creative if they don’t actually have a cold storage warehouse,” Herpich says, adding that you’re also going to see more “from a packaging standpoint in being able to keep things cool because at the end of the day, the insurance and the claims can be costly if you don’t do it the right way.”\\n9. Last-mile logistics remain a challenge\\nWhile interest in grocery delivery was already growing pre-pandemic, it is now the preferred method of grocery shopping for many consumers.\\n“There was a small niche of people who did home delivery of grocery, but that market has blossomed,” says Wilson. “Every major chain is now partnering with some sort of home delivery service. In the beginning, they would send a shopper to the store to fulfill the delivery, and now it’s working out of warehouses. Now, they’ve pivoted that there are warehouses just for that at-home delivery.”\\n10. Demand for reverse logistics will grow\\n3PLs place a lack of importance on reverse logistics, but considering the growing size of the market, it is suggested 3PLs may be missing out on “the untapped potential of reverse logistics to their overall growth and customer loyalty.\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\nAMY WUNDERLIN\\nfreelance writer\\nTHE LEADER IN TEMPERATURECONTROLLED LOGISTICS\\nBuilding trust through outstanding performance\\nWarehouse Solutions | Transportation Solutions Brokerage Solutions | CES Solutions\\n908-351-2800 | EastCoastWarehouse.com\\nTOP SOFTWARE & TECH PROVIDERS AWARD: VISIBILITY, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT LEAD THE WAY\\nIn February 2020, MIT Management Sloan School predicted that machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced analytics would be the top supply chain technologies set to deliver the most competitive advantage.

today expect to get what they want when they want it—whether it’s ordering something online that can be delivered in a few days or going to the grocery store to shop fully stocked shelves. However, the COVID-19 pandemic changed all of that. It exposed the vulnerabilities of the global supply chain and logistics companies to quickly adapt to continue to move products and goods throughout the world.\\nOver the last two years, while some businesses have become experts in shipping logistics, others have been pushed outside of their comfort zones to find alternate ways to get their products to market. This inconvenience unfortunately created more challenges and issues for businesses such as increased costs, elevated inventory and evolving risks.\\nSupply chain efficiency is essential in business, and delays and bottlenecks are friction points for an already stressed supply chain. While many factors contribute to supply chain issues, the main ones are demand, material supply, bottlenecks and labor shortages.\\nBottlenecks and shipping delays\\nPort inefficiencies are a major cause of the supply chain bottleneck. If ships get held up at a port or can’t unload cargo quickly, the delay has a rippling effect on the supply chain. Some ports are investing in newer equipment like environmentally friendly autonomous cranes to help improve efficiency. However, it will take more than a year for these cranes to be built and delivered, which means the ports will continue to face logjams. Although these investments in port infrastructure have been happening, it has not been able to keep pace with the growth in size of container ships and demand during COVID-19.\\nShipping and logistics problems\\nAside from delays, businesses face unique risks and other problems with shipping such as costs, lost cargo, environmental regulations, damaged cargo and goods and world events like political unrest. It is important to remember that it is not just the product owner that faces these risks. Logistics companies are also exposed to various liability risks.\\nTypically, companies rely on ocean freight to transport goods. In fact, the majority of global trade goes through ocean vessel because the cost for air freight is exponentially more than shipping by sea. The other big difference between ocean and air freight is speed. Shipping goods on a plane means they will reach their destination faster than traveling by sea. Because of this, using a cargo plane is generally reserved for more expensive goods or perishable products.\\nHowever, when supply chains were significantly delayed and disrupted during the height of the pandemic, some businesses were unable to rely on air freight because of cost, storage space and weight. A shipping container can be 20- or 40-feet long and can hold a lot of materials. With air cargo, goods are traveling by pallet. The physics of a plane can’t hold the same amount of weight as a shipping container. Unfortunately, it is not possible to just flip a switch and immediately start using air freight.\\nInsurance to help protect supply chain\\nGiven the delays and issues in the supply chain, businesses and logistics shipping companies face unique risks. Although some of these risks were present before the pandemic, alternative measures for freight travel can create new exposures. If a company decides to charter their own vessel instead of working with a logistics shipping company, they are entering into a different agreement. It is a channel they would not normally go through, so they must think about the risks involved. It is why businesses need to make sure their insurance coverage is up to date.\\nAs countries reopened, demand skyrocketed and manufacturers could not re-open quickly enough to meet this increase.\\nKARLA SCOTT\\nsenior managing director, ocean marine,\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\nCLIVE NIX\\ntransport and marine liability underwriter, international, The Hartford\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\nThe Hartford\\nYESTERDAY WAS THE TIME TO START NEARSHORING\\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies around the world have been struggling to rebuild their global supply chains, both in terms of finding suppliers to deliver the key parts needed in their manufacturing and/or delivering end products to their customers.\\nFood Logistics’ editor-in-chief Marina Mayer sat down with Michele Porrino Perassi, executive director of World Trade Center San Luis Potosi in Mexico, to talk about post-COVID-19 pandemic challenges for maritime and air cargo, logistics challenges deriving from e-commerce and how nearshoring is an option for U.S. and Latin American companies to reconfigure their global value chains.\\nFood Logistics: What does the state of the supply chain look like next year and in the years ahead?\\nMichele Porrino Perassi: Since we are an industrial park in Mexico, very close to the U.S. market, offering exceptional services for any business wishing to expand or start operations, the logistic challenges during the pandemic are generating many opportunities for us. The “nearshoring effect” is a real thing. Companies are approaching us and other industrial parks to reduce logistics risks and increase logistics efficiency. Historically, the goal for manufacturing companies was zero inventory. The pandemic has changed that thinking. Now, many companies are trying to relocate all their manufacturing capacity from Asia. In some cases, when that’s not possible, they are relocating part of their capacity. And in other cases, companies cannot relocate manufacturing but can substantially increase their safety stock. These measures are helping, but they won’t reduce logistical challenges immediately. Even with just increasing safety stocks, you need warehouses, and there aren't enough in North America. The current vacancy rate in warehouses in Canada, the U.S., and\\n@donvictori0l.stock.adobe.com\\nMexico are close to 0%. This process will take time. I believe it will take 1-2 years for companies to get to safer performance.\\nFood Logistics: Explain the importance of logistic hubs in relation to ports and distribution centers.\\nPorrino Perassi: It makes sense to relocate a business to a logistic hub to have different ways to access the market so you can be more efficient. For example, companies located in WTC Premium Industrial Park in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, have access to a good rail service connecting to truck routes in Mexico and the U.S. and a free trade zone that makes making and receiving shipments easier in an international environment. Our city also has a strong, established supply chain, making logistics very efficient. Being part of a global network such as the WTCA is extremely beneficial because there are over 300 WTC locations in over 100 countries.\\nFood Logistics: Explain some of the postCOVID-19 pandemic challenges for maritime and air cargo and what’s in store for 2023.\\nPorrino Perassi: Companies must be more creative. That may be finding better, more efficient routes. It could also be using combined processes (having part of your manufacturing done in Asia, part of it done in Mexico and part close to your market). You can also have some manufacturing done on the road (by rail, etc.) Looking years ahead, by using technology, such as 3D printing, companies may be able to have manufacturing done on-site and in real-time wherever they are located.\\nFood Logistics: Explain some of the logistics challenges deriving from e-commerce.\\nPorrino Perassi: E-commerce has been increasing exponentially, and there are many challenges: lack of warehouse space, a shortage of drivers, dealing with reverse logistics (consumers returning items). I’m convinced that companies need to build a relationship with consumers and be able to suggest and explain more efficient ways to supply merchandise. There’s a lot of technology available that can enhance the experience for the customer while also improving logistics efficiently, and at the same time, taking care of the environment because that’s critical.\\nSCAN QR CODE\\nFor the complete article\\nHOW NFTS CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO SUPPLY CHAINS\\n@denisismagilov.stock.adobe.com\\nIt’s no secret that global supply chains are under duress. Since the onset of the pandemic, the increase in consumer demand paired with product and labor shortages have tested the current processes and technologies in place.\\nSupply chains are in need of a technology re-set, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a useful tool to digitize, track and trace items. NFTs can be used for authentication to transfer ownership rights and to store data that’s verifiable on blockchains. With the average product moving through many touchpoints on its journey to a consumer, an NFT can be paired with that product and used to record, verify and report each touchpoint. Ownership of that NFT can be transferred as the product changes hands to the eventual purchaser. The implementation of NFTs into supply chains at large could enable warehouses, manufacturers and consumers to better understand and refine the product journey. Here are a few examples of how they can be integrated:\\nConsumer transparency and certification\\nSupply chain disruptions, combined with a growing consumer interest in sustainable and ethically sourced products, have made it more important to give consumers a clearer understanding into where things come from and how each step in a product’s journey impacts the environment.\\nNFTs can be used as “digital twins” of products to verify and track items as they go from raw materials to an item in a consumer’s hands. Not only does this implementation give a purchaser a verifiable certificate of ownership, it can also give consumers insights into sustainable practices in supply chains. Digital twin NFTs can also be used for connecting consumers to brands as the means to unlock exclusive perks and post purchase promotions.\\nFor sellers, it’s important to note that when customers accept digital twin NFTs, the seller can then see and take note of the customers’ wallet addresses. This provides a valuable anchor for addressing customers, even across different environments like brick-and-mortar stores, online shops, IoT kiosks or public events. Sellers can issue promotions or solicitations to these addresses and have a much stronger connection to customers than if they just had their email or mailing addresses.\\nTraceability\\nTracking and tracing the movement and quality of goods as they flow through the supply chain has been an ongoing challenge for companies, manufacturers and supply chain professionals, as well as consumers. Digital twin NFTs have the ability to provide real-time tracking and verifiable records into the environmental and social impact and overall quality of goods.\\nFor companies moving large amounts of inventory, digital twin NFTs can be leveraged to track and trace individual items or shipments. This could be especially useful with items where multiple checkpoints and authorizations are required along the way.\\nAnother example is with food and beverage distribution. Food distribution requires temperature controls and checks at multiple locations to ensure quality for consumers and to prevent food waste. Digital twin NFTs give consumers, distributors and manufacturers a non-fungible record of the supply chain journey to ensure the quality of perishable items.\\nData insights\\nThese NFTs can also provide easy visibility into not just where items are located but also the history of various components, information on manufacturing steps and more. As supply chain leaders and technologists seek to better understand and pinpoint logistical challenges, NFTs’ ability to store data using smart contracts on blockchains provides all parties with a verifiable retrospect into product journeys.\\nPaving the way to adoption\\nWhile supply chains are poised to benefit from the adoption of NFTs, there are many common roadblocks to implementing them into legacy supply chain systems.\\nFirst is the high transaction costs associated with modifying or transferring NFTs on some blockchains. Transaction fees need to be nearly free for all high-volume businesses, otherwise they can’t be justified. Implementation expense is another concern. Point of sale and distribution companies involved in new standards have a hard enough time supporting an additional REST endpoint, let alone running a blockchain “validator” node. However, this is changing as more source code packages and cloud based one-click solutions become available.\\nOverall, we are still in the early stages of utilizing NFTs to better our supply chains. The good news is that there is an appetite for transparency, traceability and trust .\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\nJULIEN GENESTOUX\\nfounder and CEO,\\nUnlock\\nHOW A VIRTUAL TWIN CHANGES THE COLD FOODS PACKAGING GAME\\nPackaging design engineers— especially for food products—will say that developing an attractive, functional design to promote a brand involves many factors. Whether designing a bottle, carton, box or other form, exact requirements call for applying a combination of creativity and science.\\nProtecting food from elements (light, moisture, air and even pathogens like bacteria) and ensuring package integrity means goods arrive safely in stores. Consider developing the packaging for delicate éclairs, for instance. The éclair packaging must entice the consumer in the store and the pastry must taste good after purchase. To add more complexity, consumer packaged goods companies with razor-thin profit margins must not only keep packaging costs down, but also strive to meet sustainability goals.\\nComplicating packaging decisions further, new regulations require manufacturers to phase out single-use plastics, Styrofoam, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other bisphenol A (BPA)-laden polymers. Instead, packaging designers now use eco-friendly alternatives (like bamboo, rice husk and even mushroom fiber) and responsibly-sourced paper. How do manufacturers meet all specifications with minimal design iterations while mitigating the risk of damaged products or product recalls?\\nTo ensure success in achieving these goals, engineers must start with simulation and the virtual twin to make the right decisions.\\n@petunyia.stock.adobe.com\\nAcross-the-board packaging success\\nTo meet growing customer demand, companies are looking for ways to bring products to market more quickly. One option is to eliminate traditional prototyping methods in favor of 3D\\nsimulation software by applying a virtual twin of packaging designs to define the optimal balance of strength, size and performance in the shortest time possible.\\nAlso analyze how packaging would withstand temperature extremes and high humidity over extended periods without expensive environmental chambers and lengthy testing.\\nBecause the virtual twin allows users to simulate these and countless other variables, optimizing a product or package design takes hours rather than weeks or even months. There are no physical prototypes to build and discard when testing design options.\\nCool tech for cold temps\\nWhen a global leader in convenience foods and beverages needed similar capabilities, it employed 3D simulation on a virtual twin of its beverage packaging. The company’s blow molding department sought to identify what processing parameters would provide the best wall thickness in stretch blow molded and extrusion blow molded beverage bottles. Through end-to-end simulation, the beverage maker eliminated its previous trial-and-error approach to bottle design. In addition, packaging engineers at the company have begun using simulation to perform feasibility studies on recycled plastics and paper beverage packaging, each aimed at reducing carbon footprints. The company now enjoys newfound cost reductions and improved sustainability.\\nSustainable directions\\nThe drive to meet sustainability requirements to support a lower carbon footprint and a more circular economy continues to grow by the year.\\nPackaging manufacturers of all kinds can do more with recycled plastics or switch to environmentally friendly materials. Meeting this challenge in an efficient, cost-effective manner via 3D simulation tools and a virtual twin allows companies to define the best fit, form and function for packagin—without physical prototypes.\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\nADRIAN WOOD\\nstrategic business development director,\\nDassault Systèmes\\nPEST MANAGEMENT TIPS FOR COLDER WEATHER\\nThe winter season can serve as an open invitation into business for pests that don’t go dormant during the colder months. These critters will be searching for food and shelter and your building will look good to them. Supply chain facilities can be a weak link where pests can contaminate goods.\\nHere are the most problematic pests threatening to put a kink in your food and supply chain during this time of year.\\nRodents. Along with the danger of possibly sparking a fire, these pests bring health-related threats. They are associated with numerous potentially serious health hazards, including typhus, food poisoning and hantavirus. Rodents can contaminate products through droppings and other biohazardous body wastes.\\nCockroaches. These stubborn pests thrive in heated buildings during the winter. Oriental cockroaches enter by crawling through gaps or openings in the foundation. American cockroaches follow sewage lines and plumbing into boiler rooms or utility rooms. And German cockroaches can hitch a free ride inside through shipments, bags and even clothing.\\nBirds. Birds like pigeons, house sparrows and starlings may carry a variety of pathogens that can be transferred to humans and products. For example, dust from dried-out bird feathers and droppings, carrying pathogens, could be inhaled.\\nAnts. Pavement ants and odorous house ants are two species that may establish colonies under foundations or slabs yearround. As a result, they sometimes appear inside structures even in the wintertime when other insects are not active. When ants are seen indoors in the winter, it will most likely be near sources of heat and moisture. These could be where plumbing and utilities penetrate slabs.\\nFlies. There are two major groups of pest flies that can affect facilities. Fruit flies, drain flies and phorid flies are in the first group. These flies establish populations within the facility and breed in unsanitary places as floor drains, septic soil beneath slabs, sewage ejector pits and sumps. House flies and blow flies are among the filth flies and are known to be active in the late winter or early spring. They normally live and breed outside in excrement, garbage or animal carcasses.\\nFortunately there are many steps to help prevent pests from threatening the cold food chain. 1. Identify popular pest areas early. If you can identify the key areas they will gravitate to ahead of time, you can address them before pests are introduced. Common hotspots include storage rooms, delivery areas, utility rooms, break rooms and trash areas. 2. Look for evidence. Once you’ve identified the areas, monitor them frequently for activity. Look for damage to packaging and food, droppings and obvious entry points. If you notice anything, log it immediately. 3. Seal any openings. Pests love to sneak into buildings through cracks and gaps. Cockroaches, ants, flies and spiders are especially skilled at entering this way. Do an assessment of your siding and foundation and repair where needed. Seal any gaps between doors and windows with caulk, ensure weather stripping is in place and undamaged and replace any damaged screens in windows. 4. Clean and sanitize. Clean up spills and crumbs as soon as possible. Keep storage areas and utility closets clean and tidy and avoid unnecessary clutter (particularly cardboard). Instruct employees not to consume food or leave food wrappers and bags in operational areas. Clear your drains of buildup/ 5. Deal with smells. Bad smells naturally occur near and around trash areas and dumpsters. Neutralize the smells or add a pleasant scent.\\nWith staff training, diligent maintenance, cleaning practices and the help of a pest management provider, you can help keep facilities pest-free during the winter months and every season after.\\nromul014\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR NICOLAS ELLIS technical specialist, Western Pest Services\\nMARCH 20-23, 2023 MCCORMICK PLACE CHICAGO, IL\\npromatshow.com\\nsupply chains explored\\nWith over 900 of the world’s leading manufacturing and supply chain solution providers under one roof, you can see firsthand what the future holds – and find the tools you need to shockproof your operations and move your business forward.

2023\\nDemand for last-mile grocery delivery skyrocketed during the pandemic as online grocery sales soared and many sheltered in place.According to Khaled Naim, co-founder and CEO of Onfleet, both delivery and online sales continue to grow despite inflation.Food-at-home prices increased more than 13% over the past 12 months, marking the largest 12-month increase in 43 years.Though consumer price sensitivity is at an all-time high, Americans have become dependent on online ordering and delivery services for staple consumer goods because of the convenience and added health safety.So, as we hopefully near a post-pandemic era, what will the future hold for the last mile?• Demand for faster, more streamlined last-mile grocery delivery will continue to grow as consumer expectations rise.• Ease of scalability will be key to grocer success with last-mile delivery.• Grocers will leverage delivery management technology to make delivery a competitive advantage.• Modernization of the last mile will become a reality as more grocers begin their digital transformation.As last-mile delivery becomes essential to consumers, the cost of inaction in the grocery delivery market will be steep.Scan the QR code to learn more\\nhttps://foodl.me/3ciu1m\\niQoncept-stock.adobe.com\\nRobotics for Reshoring\\nAn ABB survey revealed a growing trend in U.S.and European businesses toward re-shoring or nearshoring operations to build resilience in the face of global challenges, however there is a significant education gap in Getty Images the skills necessary for these strategies to succeed.“The world is constantly evolving—businesses are shifting existing structures and adopting new technologies to future-proof their operations for a variety of challenges and uncertainties, with robotic automation playing a key role,” says Sami Atiya, president of ABB’s Robotics and Discrete Automation Business.“We need significant investment in continuous education to prepare our existing and future workforce to thrive in an age of robotics and automation, important not only to prepare for the widespread shifts we are seeing, but to create prosperous societies going forward.”Scan the

that would’ve embargoed shipments and further crippled global supply chains.These disruptions could have extended beyond the rail sector itself, and affected other transportation modes, primarily trucking, according to Uber Freight, who estimates that even if 20% of rail freight shifted to trucking, spot rates could’ve doubled in just that short period of time.“As we’ve learned from the past two years, the truckload market is very sensitive to disruptions in supply and demand.While spot rates react quickly to such changes, contract rates lag by a few months.Therefore, a disruption of this magnitude would have a direct impact on spot rates,” according to Uber Freight.Data indicates that the average weight of a carload is 128,000 pounds and that of an intermodal load is 33,000 pounds.According to the Commodity Flow Survey, rail carries about the same amount of freight as for-hire truckloads (measured in ton-miles).When excluding local hauls (less than 100 miles) and light loads (less than 10,000 pounds, which are likely LTL shipments), rail carries 33% more freight than long-distance for-hire truckloads.Total emissions produced by all the truckload freight and 20% of the served rail freight would have increased by 19%.Scan the QR code to learn more In addition to the known supply chain shortages, the current trucking industry challenges https://foodl.me/dmluym are having negative impacts on cold chain integrity, increasing the potential for temperature excursions that could accelerate the degradation of perishable food quality and safety.Yet, despite the emerging complexities of this new trucking industry landscape, cold chain stakeholders have access to data analytics, tools and services to help them maintain their strict quality standards, according to Doug Thurston, VP of sales, cold chain digital solutions at Emerson.Most importantly, data provides an objective record of cold chain temperatures in-transit.In challenging times like these, where truckers and retailers simply can’t afford the negative impacts of rejected loads, data serves as an arbiter of supply chain disputes.It takes emotion out of the equation by providing indisputable proof of precisely when and where temperature excursions occur.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"AwkyGfuJSAmSfTA10Ct3Ch4W0Tr/DHE8fj9ptY0Cc/M=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5cdf301d-528e-4df7-a68f-a808c8857d82":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5cdf301d-528e-4df7-a68f-a808c8857d82\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://issuu.com/supplydemandchainfoodlogistics/docs/flog1222_digital/s/17537815\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"d8e9b1b8-ae29-4fb6-a050-66376e0f7b08\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://issuu.com/supplydemandchainfoodlogistics/docs/flog1222_digital/s/17537815\"},\"hash\":\"2KNNKCudiiTU5ZawBiaFRX8OmHOij0tHdfeVAvWIdus=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"6c2172a5-2370-4c7a-8837-904398d2639a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://issuu.com/supplydemandchainfoodlogistics/docs/flog1222_digital/s/17537815\"},\"hash\":\"AwkyGfuJSAmSfTA10Ct3Ch4W0Tr/DHE8fj9ptY0Cc/M=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b8106514-5c90-4da0-a76d-c43621b6e00f\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"eveMcWFmEjz94Cjq/BrFDJH43KrS7+Jn5cZ/QKPJIFA=\"}},\"text\":\"Scan

so-called “normal” supply chain even exist?Prior to 2019, nearly all supply chains were considered normal.They operated the same way, day in and day out, with only a few hiccups here and there.Post-pandemic though, normal has been redefined to better suit the nature of how supply chains operate in a disruption-laden environment.Natural disasters, port strikes, rail strikes, worker shortages, inflation and risk continue to present bottlenecks in all facets of the supply chain, leading some to believe that the logistics space may never achieve normalcy again.Case in point: Nearly 45% of economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal estimated bottlenecks would ease by the second half of 2022.Yet, here we are, about to turn the page to 2023, and the supply chain still seems anything but normal.China, for example, continues to enforce a zero-COVID-19 policy “that can partially or fully lock down major cities like Chengdu, Shenzhen, Xian, or Shanghai,” says Mirko Woitzik, global director, intelligence solutions at Everstream Analytics.“While this persists, we will continue to see port, airport and city shutdowns, as well as extended travel bans, which will impact supply chain logistics.”“The global economic slowdown and rising inflation rates will also create workforce and labor issues within the supply chain.This will add financial pressure to many parts of the supply chain that are still reeling from the impacts of COVID-19 coupled with the war in Ukraine.Cost-cutting measures will likely increase labor shortages in critical parts of the supply chain from food production to ports and railways, which have the potential to cause further turmoil,” adds Woitzik.Other factors such as inflation and rising fuel costs, to name a few, continue to put a strain on the supply chain.On the other hand though, several industry leaders detail how this return to normalcy may not be as far-fetched in 2023 as currently perceived, but it will still be very different from prepandemic.Supply chains are unlikely to stabilize until first half of 2024 and beyond, while 22% expect disruptions to continue until the second half of 2023, according to a Carl Marks Advisors survey.In a separate report, Citi economists said logistics pressures from excessive consumer demand for goods are easing up, yet companies shouldn’t consider an “all clear” just yet.The physical shortage of capacity, which drives up freight rates, doesn’t seem to be an issue at this time, according to SeaIntelligence, with models suggesting that a return to “normal” at a 2% capacity loss baseline by early 2023 is possible.“In supply chain circles battered by more than two years of upheaval, the word ‘normal’ is creeping into the outlook for 2023.From the Logistics Managers’ Index to the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, we’re seeing forecasters more optimistic about the future outlook,” says Ben Harris, senior managing director, client solutioning and strategy at Cushman & Wakefield.“And while we’re optimistic that they’re right, we continue to see continuing challenges around raw materials and labor shortages, which are unchanged since last year at this time.Hopefully things will start to substantially ease by summer 2023, but it is going to be bumpy and uneven.”In order to obtain somewhat of a normal way of doing business, companies must adhere to a New Normal, but in a way that’s defined as new on a regular basis.Think of it as an alternate state of the supply chain, where the timeline has skewed to create a new supply chain space [Back to the Future fans, anyone?].This new continuum is laden with bottlenecks, strikes and challenges never before experienced.And, it’s all happening at once.And, it’s all

rising costs,” says Tom Madrecki, VP of supply chain and logistics, Consumer Brands Association.Rail strike strikes back\\nIn early October, U.S.supply chains dodged a rail strike, one that would’ve embargoed shipments and further crippled global supply chains.President Biden enforced a 60-day cooling off period, where the Presidential Emergency Board looked at the disputed issues in the negotiations and issued a recommended settlement.These disruptions could have extended beyond the rail sector itself, and affected other transportation modes, primarily trucking, according to Uber Freight, who estimated that even if 20% of rail freight shifted to trucking, spot rates could’ve doubled in just that short period of time.Fast forward a month later, and rail workers continue to express concern over their current labor contracts.Analysts say a possible next shutdown could “hamper passenger service and slow the flow of goods to stores and warehouses.A union strike could cost the U.S.economy up to $2 billion per day, according to an estimate from the Association of American Railroads.Roughly 40% of the nation’s long-distance trade is moved by rail—more than any

for the next couple of years.Problems at the port\\nThen there’s problems at the port, which didn’t just happen overnight and certainly didn’t start when the EVER GIVEN got stuck in the Suez Canal.The backlog of inventory compounded with the oversupply of containers is contributing to second-hand container market prices plummeting, according to analysis from Container xChange.“The current situation of oversupply of containers is a result of a series of reactionary market disruptions that began soon after the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020.With the rise in demand, congestion at ports increased and the container capacity was held up for a considerably long period of time.This led to the panic ordering of new boxes at record levels.With time, as markets reopen and demand softens, the oversupply is a natural outcome of demand-supply forces\\nWith inflation and lockdowns, disruptions will continue to change the equation between supply, demand and prices.balancing at new levels,” says Christian Roeloffs, co-founder and CEO of Container xChange.Disrupting 2023\\nCurrently the industry is faced with several disruptions.For starters, the Russia-Ukraine war doesn’t seem to be ending any time soon.“Russia cutting off gas supplies to many parts of Europe is greatly affecting the price of energy in Europe.Currently, Europe is facing 10% inflation as of September 2022.We will likely see inflation soar even further during the winter months.The increase in costs has resulted in companies in Europe either shifting their production to other parts of the world or reducing their output.In some cases, companies that cannot afford it had to close, or stop production entirely.These problems will not be an overnight fix and will surely continue to be an issue into the new year,” says Woitzik.Heightened financial volatility, sustainable development divestment, complex global supply chain reconfigurations and mounting trade costs stemming from the war in Ukraine continue to impact trade and development, according to a new study released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).“Soaring food and fuel prices will affect the most vulnerable in developing countries, putting pressure on the poorest households, which spend the highest share of their income on food, resulting in hardship and hunger,” says UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca

increase across the supply chain,” says Jennifer Karpus-Romain, executive director for Transportation Marketing & Sales Association (TMSA).The availability of ingredients and shortages in some food products continue to challenge the food sector, specifically the frozen food category.“Manufacturers may still need to reformulate or make labeling changes in response to ingredient shortages.The frozen food industry in particular is facing the diversion of soy and canola oil to make biofuels for government transportation subsidies and manufacturers face crisis-level shortages in edible vegetable oil for producing many frozen foods,” says Alison Bodor, president and CEO at American Frozen Food Institute (AFFI).Furthermore, other disruptions such as inflation and labor shortages continue to put a damper on the industry.“The trucking industry is already plagued with driver shortages.Warehouses faced similar issues earlier this year and last year.Staffing complexities and labor shortages will be an ongoing trend next year as well,” says Adhish Luitel, senior analyst, ABI Research.“Inflation has grown rapidly this year globally and a lot of regions in the world are now

likely to experience high turnover.In the current job market, the winners are those who see the opportunity to invest in systems that require low human interaction.And even when human operators are required, the ergonomics of the system will determine the turnover rate.Montana-based Doyles Sheehan, a leading distributor to convenience stores, capitalized on the opportunity to reinvent the order fulfillment process.They teamed up with Velociti Alliance North America, a technology leader for optimized order fulfillment solutions, to convert their warehouses from single-order picking to hybrid order/batch picking.While some areas of the warehouse are picked one order at a time, most areas benefit from batch-oriented picking and sorting, where one pass through inventory fills an entire truckload of orders.Through analysis and simulation of the Doyles Sheehan order history using 3-D models, Velociti was able to take their pick rate from 400 to 750 pieces per hour per employee.“Not only did the Velociti partnership significantly decrease our labor requirement, but we also increased throughput and accuracy with minimal training.The bottom-line addition to profit is significant,” says Pat Coulter, Director of Operations and Information Systems.Using wearable technology, handsfree order selection, and cloud-based order optimization, Coulter has been able to achieve top-tier results without spending millions of dollars in automation.With Velociti, Doyles Sheehan has created more ergonomic jobs for a smaller staff of dedicated employees – people they can keep, because the work is manageable.With the labor savings, Coulter has been able to create incentives for highperforming associates, recognizing them for their dedication and ensuring that they stay engaged with the company for years to come.For more information, head over to https://velocitialliance.com.\\nTRENDS IN COLD CHAIN\\nIf you had to choose a theme for 2022, its likely you would point toward supply

with a third-party company as far as its transportation, its warehousing, its final mile, everything.Companies are relying on 3PLs a lot more than they used to.”Shippers are also looking for proactive ideas from 3PLs to improve operations and reduce costs, says Armstrong, and that “3PL customers have evolved from wanting basic transportation and warehouse management skills to more strategic relationships.They are also looking at 3PLs for business continuity management and are seeking well-positioned 3PLs which can even operate in cases of disasters.Some customers are asking 3PLs to present their internal plans for labor shortages, disaster preparedness, work stoppage, weather-related transportation disruptions, technology outages and other risks to operations.”Wilson notes that it’s no longer just about price, but what you can bring to the table.“It’s about positioning yourself to have the most options and the best options,” he explains.Drew Herpich, chief commercial officer at Nolan Transportation Group and Transportation Insight, attributes the continued growth in the 3PL market to a level playing field.“People are now starting to accept brokers on the same level as

adds that shippers are looking for an “elastic logistics plan,” with a partner “that can look at the overall picture and offer options.”This type of flexibility requires IT integration with transparency and visibility into both yours and your customers’ systems, “so that they’re able to know in real-time everything that is going on with their supply chain and that the 3PL is handling it,” says Wilson.3.A continued crunch on warehouse capacity\\nCold chain and dry warehousing capacity is tight and will continue to be a challenge throughout 2023 as shippers look to 3PLs to find

operations.Wilson predicts the solution for this shortage, in part, will be the integration of robotics in the warehouse.This also tracks with the findings in the study, which found 84% of 3PLs and 70% of shippers are either actively implementing or researching and reviewing augmenting their supply chain operations with new technology and/or automation to offset talent shortage.5.Rates will trend downward\\nRecipient of Food Logistics’ 2022 Top Software & Technology Providers Award\\nEnd-to-End Visibility Shipper - Carrier Matching\\nAs disruptions in the supply chain continue to resolve, Wilson predicts rates trending downward.While general freight volume is currently muted and rates for most modes are down significantly from the first half of 2022, Armstrong says more historically normal transportation rates and demand levels should progress into 2023.This means that price will no longer be the biggest differentiator in a competitive 3PL landscape.“When you’re looking to work with a new customer, everyone’s rates are going down into the ground right now.Its more about providing a service level and finding other services that provide a value-add for the customer,” Wilson says.To that point, Armstrong says that value-added warehousing and distribution will continue to do well given the general lack of warehousing space, which is nearing a critical level in the cold chain and strong growth in e-commerce fulfillment and last-mile delivery.Real-Time Tracking\\nAutomation & Efficiency Instant Reports\\nCustomer Support & Relationship\\nJoin Our

process automates traditional spot-market freight brokerage sales functions, and according to Armstrong, is increasing shippers’ use of more spot vs. contract pricing.“The ongoing digitalization of transactional truckload freight brokerage continues at a rapid pace as more 3PLs have built API integrations to large shippers’ transportation management systems for truckload spot-market rate quoting and automated load tendering and booking,” says Armstrong, adding that it has become a competitive differentiator as 3PLs look to increase the number of loads and shipments they manage per person per day and revenue per person per year.7.Sustainability will demand a bigger role\\nSustainability will also be top of mind for many 3PLs this year.“The solutions that we see today have not been exactly

specifically mentioning major grocery chains who in recent years have announced plans to reduce emissions, cut their carbon footprints and create greater efficiencies in the warehouse.Lighting and temperature control are the two biggest areas companies are focusing on in the warehouse, with energy efficiency found through LED lights, skylights, sensors that monitor usage and turn off lights when not in use and highefficiency HVAC systems.8.Innovative cold storage solutions are needed\\nAs warehouse capacity continues to tighten, Herpich says 3PLs will need to get more creative in keeping products cold.“You are going to see people get more and more creative if they don’t actually have a cold storage warehouse,” Herpich says, adding that you’re also going to see more “from a packaging standpoint in being able to keep things cool because at the end of the day, the insurance and the claims can be costly if you don’t do it the right way.”9.Last-mile logistics remain a challenge\\nWhile interest in grocery delivery was already growing pre-pandemic, it is now the preferred method of grocery shopping for many consumers.“There was a small niche of people who did home delivery of grocery, but that market has blossomed,” says Wilson.“Every major chain is now partnering with some sort of home delivery service.In the beginning, they would send a shopper to the store to fulfill the delivery, and now it’s working out of warehouses.Now, they’ve pivoted that there are warehouses just for that at-home delivery.”10.Demand for reverse logistics will grow\\n3PLs place a lack of importance on reverse logistics, but considering the growing size of the market, it is suggested 3PLs may be missing out on “the untapped potential of reverse logistics to their overall growth

Platform\\nINSURANCE COVERAGE AMID SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES\\nConsumers today expect to get what they want when they want it—whether it’s ordering something online that can be delivered in a few days or going to the grocery store to shop fully stocked shelves.However, the COVID-19 pandemic changed all of that.It exposed the vulnerabilities of the global supply chain and logistics companies to quickly adapt to continue to move products and goods throughout the world.Over the last two years, while some businesses have become experts in shipping logistics, others have been pushed outside of their comfort zones to find alternate ways to get their products to market.This inconvenience unfortunately created more challenges and issues for businesses such as increased costs, elevated inventory and evolving risks.Supply chain efficiency is essential in business, and delays and bottlenecks are friction points for an already stressed supply chain.While many factors contribute to supply chain issues, the main ones are demand, material supply, bottlenecks and labor shortages.Bottlenecks and shipping delays\\nPort inefficiencies are a major cause of the supply chain bottleneck.If ships get held up at a port or can’t unload cargo quickly, the delay has a rippling effect on the supply chain.Some ports are investing in newer equipment like environmentally friendly autonomous cranes to help improve efficiency.However, it will take more than a year for these cranes to be built and delivered, which means the ports will continue to face logjams.Although these investments in port infrastructure have been happening, it has not been able to keep pace with the growth in size of container ships and demand during COVID-19.Shipping and logistics problems\\nAside from delays, businesses face unique risks and other problems with shipping such as costs, lost cargo, environmental regulations, damaged cargo and goods and world events like political unrest.It is important to remember that it is not just the product owner that faces these risks.Logistics companies are also exposed to various liability risks.Typically, companies rely on ocean freight to transport goods.In fact, the majority of global trade goes through ocean vessel because the cost for air freight is exponentially more than shipping by sea.The other big difference between ocean and air freight is speed.Shipping goods on a plane means they will reach their destination faster than traveling by sea.Because of this, using a cargo plane is generally reserved for more expensive goods or perishable products.However, when supply chains were significantly delayed and disrupted during the height of the pandemic, some businesses were unable to rely on air freight because of cost, storage space and weight.A shipping container can be 20- or 40-feet long and can hold a lot of materials.With air cargo, goods are traveling by pallet.The physics of a plane can’t hold the same amount of weight as a shipping container.Unfortunately, it is not possible to just flip a switch and immediately start using air freight.Insurance to help protect supply chain\\nGiven the delays and issues in the supply chain, businesses and logistics shipping companies face unique risks.Although some of these risks were present before the pandemic, alternative measures for freight travel can create new exposures.If a company decides to charter their own vessel instead of working with a logistics shipping company, they are entering into a different agreement.It is a channel they would not normally go through, so they must think about the risks involved.It is why businesses need to make sure their insurance coverage is up to date.As countries reopened, demand skyrocketed and manufacturers could not re-open quickly enough to meet this increase.KARLA SCOTT\\nsenior managing director, ocean marine,\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\nCLIVE NIX\\ntransport and marine liability underwriter, international, The Hartford\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\nThe Hartford\\nYESTERDAY WAS THE TIME TO START NEARSHORING\\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies around the world have been struggling to rebuild their global supply chains, both in terms of finding suppliers to deliver the key parts needed in their manufacturing and/or delivering end products to their customers.Food Logistics’ editor-in-chief Marina Mayer sat down with Michele Porrino Perassi, executive director of World Trade Center San Luis Potosi in Mexico, to talk about post-COVID-19 pandemic challenges for maritime and air cargo,

Logistics’ editor-in-chief Marina Mayer sat down with Michele Porrino Perassi, executive director of World Trade Center San Luis Potosi in Mexico, to talk about post-COVID-19 pandemic challenges for maritime and air cargo, logistics challenges deriving from e-commerce and how nearshoring is an option for U.S.and Latin American companies to reconfigure their global value chains.Food Logistics: What does the state of the supply chain look like next year and in the years ahead?Michele Porrino Perassi: Since we are an industrial park in Mexico, very close to the U.S.market, offering exceptional services for any business wishing to expand or start operations, the logistic challenges during the pandemic are generating many opportunities for us.The “nearshoring effect” is a real thing.Companies are approaching us and other industrial parks to reduce logistics risks and increase logistics efficiency.Historically, the goal for manufacturing companies was zero inventory.The pandemic has changed that thinking.Now, many companies are trying to relocate all their manufacturing capacity from Asia.In some cases, when that’s not possible, they are relocating part of their capacity.And in other cases, companies cannot relocate manufacturing but can substantially increase their safety stock.These measures are helping, but they won’t reduce logistical challenges immediately.Even with just increasing safety stocks, you need warehouses, and there aren't enough in North America.The current vacancy rate in warehouses in Canada, the U.S., and\\n@donvictori0l.stock.adobe.com\\nMexico are close to 0%.This process will take time.I believe it will take 1-2 years for companies to get to safer performance.Food Logistics: Explain the importance of logistic hubs in relation to ports and distribution centers.Porrino Perassi: It makes sense to relocate a business to a logistic hub to have different ways to access the market so you can be more efficient.For example, companies located in WTC Premium Industrial Park in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, have access to a good rail service connecting to truck routes in Mexico and the U.S.and a free trade zone that makes making and receiving shipments easier in an international environment.Our city also has a strong, established supply chain, making logistics very efficient.Being part of a global network such as the WTCA is extremely beneficial because there are over 300 WTC locations in over 100 countries.Food Logistics: Explain some of the postCOVID-19 pandemic challenges for maritime and air cargo and what’s in store for 2023.Porrino Perassi: Companies must be more creative.That may be finding better, more efficient routes.It could also be using combined processes (having part of your manufacturing done in Asia, part of it done in Mexico and part close to your market).You can also have some manufacturing done on the road (by rail, etc.) Looking years ahead, by using technology, such as 3D printing, companies may be able to have manufacturing done on-site and in real-time wherever they are located.Food Logistics: Explain some of the logistics challenges deriving from e-commerce.Porrino Perassi: E-commerce has been increasing exponentially, and there are many challenges: lack of warehouse space, a shortage of drivers, dealing with reverse logistics (consumers returning items).I’m convinced that companies need to build a relationship with consumers and be able to suggest and explain more efficient ways to supply merchandise.There’s a lot of technology available that can enhance the experience for the customer while also improving logistics efficiently, and at the same time, taking care of the environment because that’s critical.SCAN QR CODE\\nFor

increase in consumer demand paired with product and labor shortages have tested the current processes and technologies in place.Supply chains are in need of a technology re-set, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a useful tool to digitize, track and trace items.NFTs can be used for authentication to transfer ownership rights and to store data that’s verifiable on blockchains.With the average product moving through many touchpoints on its journey to a consumer, an NFT can be paired with that product and used to record, verify and report each touchpoint.Ownership of that NFT can be transferred as the product changes hands to the eventual purchaser.The implementation of NFTs into supply chains at large could enable warehouses, manufacturers and consumers to better understand and refine the product journey.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ZW52/UIGzudsegGG4jb6y1nCMF9YTSEJRc6PkxuD3cs=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ef75a034-5422-4a42-b78e-7ba8f094eac3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ef75a034-5422-4a42-b78e-7ba8f094eac3\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://issuu.com/supplydemandchainfoodlogistics/docs/flog1222_digital/s/17537815\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"d8e9b1b8-ae29-4fb6-a050-66376e0f7b08\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://issuu.com/supplydemandchainfoodlogistics/docs/flog1222_digital/s/17537815\"},\"hash\":\"2KNNKCudiiTU5ZawBiaFRX8OmHOij0tHdfeVAvWIdus=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"8c7c1a74-de98-442d-a76e-d0b2e26ba68a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://issuu.com/supplydemandchainfoodlogistics/docs/flog1222_digital/s/17537815\"},\"hash\":\"KHM7jO72S4OWQ4LgDTvHj81R/nVEZhgR2VDGe6e/wvI=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"2b3f8e6c-c891-45fb-b319-9a69acc89b63\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"FWIIa2pzDvAXHwXWtKheDFHtPnuOaY3LnGk1yV8JQpI=\"}},\"text\":\"stock.adobe.com\\nIt’s no secret that global supply chains are under duress.Since the onset of the pandemic, the increase in consumer demand paired with product and labor shortages have tested the current processes and technologies in place.Supply chains are in need of a technology re-set, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a useful tool to digitize, track and trace items.NFTs can be used for authentication to transfer ownership rights and to store data that’s verifiable on blockchains.With the average product moving through many touchpoints on its journey to a consumer, an NFT can be paired with that product and used to record, verify and report each touchpoint.Ownership of that NFT can be transferred as the product changes hands to the eventual purchaser.The implementation of NFTs into supply chains at large could enable warehouses, manufacturers and consumers to better understand and refine the product journey.Here are a few examples of how they can be integrated:\\nConsumer transparency and certification\\nSupply chain disruptions, combined with a growing consumer interest in sustainable and ethically sourced products, have made it more important to give consumers a clearer understanding into where things come from and how each step in a product’s journey impacts the environment.NFTs can be used as “digital twins” of products to verify and track items as they go from raw materials to an item in a consumer’s hands.Not only does this implementation give a purchaser a verifiable certificate of ownership, it can also give consumers insights into sustainable practices in supply chains.Digital twin NFTs can also be used for connecting consumers to brands as the means to unlock exclusive perks and post purchase promotions.For sellers, it’s important to note that when customers accept digital twin NFTs, the seller can then see and take note of the customers’ wallet addresses.This provides a valuable anchor for addressing customers, even across different environments like brick-and-mortar stores, online shops, IoT kiosks or public events.Sellers can issue promotions or solicitations to these addresses and have a much stronger connection to customers than if they just had their email or mailing addresses.Traceability\\nTracking and tracing the movement and quality of goods as they flow through the supply chain has been an ongoing challenge for companies, manufacturers and supply chain professionals, as well as consumers.Digital twin NFTs have the ability to provide real-time tracking and verifiable records into the environmental and social impact and overall quality of goods.For companies moving large amounts of inventory, digital twin NFTs can be leveraged to track and trace individual items or shipments.This could be especially useful with items where multiple checkpoints and authorizations are required along the way.Another example is with food and beverage distribution.Food distribution requires temperature controls and checks at multiple locations to ensure quality for consumers and to prevent food waste.Digital twin NFTs give consumers, distributors and manufacturers a non-fungible record of the supply chain journey to ensure the quality of perishable items.Data insights\\nThese NFTs can also provide easy visibility into not just where items are located but also the history of various components, information on manufacturing steps and more.As supply chain leaders and technologists seek to better understand and pinpoint logistical challenges, NFTs’ ability to store data using smart contracts on blockchains provides all parties with a verifiable retrospect into product journeys.Paving the way to adoption\\nWhile supply chains are poised to benefit from the adoption of NFTs, there are many common roadblocks to implementing them into legacy supply chain systems.First is the high transaction costs associated with modifying or transferring NFTs on some blockchains.Transaction fees need to be nearly free for all high-volume businesses, otherwise they can’t be justified.Implementation expense is another concern.Point of sale and distribution companies involved in new standards have a hard enough time supporting an additional REST endpoint, let alone running a blockchain “validator” node.However, this is changing as more source code packages and cloud based one-click solutions become available.Overall, we are still in the early stages of utilizing NFTs to better our supply chains.The good news is that there is an appetite for transparency, traceability and trust .ABOUT THE

package integrity means goods arrive safely in stores.Consider developing the packaging for delicate éclairs, for instance.The éclair packaging must entice the consumer in the store and the pastry must taste good after purchase.To add more complexity, consumer packaged goods companies with razor-thin profit margins must not only keep packaging costs down, but also strive to meet sustainability goals.Complicating packaging decisions further, new regulations require manufacturers to phase out single-use plastics, Styrofoam, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other bisphenol A (BPA)-laden polymers.Instead, packaging designers now use eco-friendly alternatives (like bamboo, rice husk and even mushroom fiber) and responsibly-sourced paper.How do manufacturers meet all specifications with minimal design iterations while mitigating the risk of damaged products or product recalls?To ensure success in achieving these goals, engineers must start with simulation and the virtual twin to make the right decisions.@petunyia.stock.adobe.com\\nAcross-the-board packaging success\\nTo meet growing customer demand, companies are looking for ways to bring products to market more quickly.One option is to eliminate traditional prototyping methods in favor of 3D\\nsimulation software by applying a virtual twin of packaging designs to define the optimal balance of strength, size and performance in the shortest time possible.Also analyze how packaging would withstand temperature extremes and high humidity over extended periods without expensive environmental chambers and lengthy testing.Because the virtual twin allows users to simulate these and countless other variables, optimizing a product or package design takes hours rather than weeks or even months.There are no physical prototypes to build and discard when testing design options.Cool tech for cold temps\\nWhen a global leader in convenience foods and beverages needed similar capabilities, it employed 3D simulation on a virtual twin of its beverage packaging.The company’s blow molding department sought to identify what processing parameters would provide the best wall thickness in stretch blow molded and extrusion blow molded beverage bottles.Through end-to-end simulation, the beverage maker eliminated its previous trial-and-error approach to bottle design.In addition, packaging engineers at the company have begun using simulation to perform feasibility studies on recycled plastics and paper beverage packaging, each aimed at reducing carbon footprints.The company now enjoys newfound cost reductions and improved sustainability.Sustainable directions\\nThe drive to meet sustainability requirements to support a lower carbon footprint and a more circular economy continues to grow by the year.Packaging manufacturers of all kinds can do more with recycled plastics or switch to environmentally friendly materials.Meeting this challenge in an efficient, cost-effective manner via 3D simulation tools and a virtual twin allows companies to define the best fit, form and function for packagin—without physical prototypes.ABOUT THE AUTHOR\\nADRIAN WOOD\\nstrategic business development director,\\nDassault

inside through shipments, bags and even clothing.Birds.Birds like pigeons, house sparrows and starlings may carry a variety of pathogens that can be transferred to humans and products.For example, dust from dried-out bird feathers and droppings, carrying pathogens, could be inhaled.Ants.Pavement ants and odorous house ants are two species that may establish colonies under foundations or slabs yearround.As a result, they sometimes appear inside structures even in the wintertime when other insects are not active.When ants are seen indoors in the winter, it will most likely be near sources of heat and moisture.These could be where plumbing and utilities penetrate slabs.Flies.There are two major groups of pest flies that can affect facilities.Fruit flies, drain flies and phorid flies are in the first group.These flies establish populations within the facility and breed in unsanitary places as floor drains, septic soil beneath slabs, sewage ejector pits and sumps.House flies and blow flies are among the filth flies and are known to be active in the late winter or early spring.They normally live and breed outside in excrement, garbage or animal carcasses.Fortunately there are many steps to help prevent pests from threatening the cold food chain.1.Identify popular pest areas early.If you can identify the key areas they will gravitate to ahead of time, you can address them before pests are introduced.Common hotspots include storage rooms, delivery areas, utility rooms, break rooms and trash areas.2.Look for evidence.Once you’ve identified the areas, monitor them frequently for activity.Look for damage to packaging and food, droppings and obvious entry points.If you notice anything, log it immediately.3.Seal any openings.Pests love to sneak into buildings through cracks and gaps.Cockroaches, ants, flies and spiders are especially skilled at entering this way.Do an assessment of your siding and foundation and repair where needed.Seal any gaps between doors and windows with caulk, ensure weather stripping is in place and undamaged and replace any damaged screens in windows.4.Clean and sanitize.Clean up spills and crumbs as soon as possible.Keep storage areas and utility closets clean and tidy and avoid unnecessary clutter (particularly cardboard).Instruct employees not to consume food or leave food wrappers and bags in operational areas.Clear your drains of buildup/ 5.Deal with smells.Bad smells naturally occur near and around trash areas and dumpsters.Neutralize the smells or add a pleasant scent.With staff training, diligent maintenance, cleaning practices and the help of a pest management provider, you can help keep facilities pest-free during the winter months and every season after.romul014\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR NICOLAS ELLIS technical
