Their main product, Paccurate, is a parcel packing intelligence platform that helps shippers make better packaging decisions and provides complete control over how every order is packed. The software aims to optimize packing to save money, materials, and the environment by reducing wasted space and materials in shipments. One of Paccurate's key features is PacSimulate, which helps users identify the right carton sizes for their operations by virtually packing historical shipments to uncover insights that can lead to more efficient packaging decisions. The software also takes into account factors such as fulfillment costs, material costs, and labor to optimize packing directly for cost efficiency. Paccurate also offers an API-first developer quickstart, allowing developers to easily integrate the software into their systems and leverage its capabilities. The company emphasizes reducing costs and waste in shipping operations, with statistics showing significant reductions in transportation spend, corrugated usage, and air shipped. In addition to cost savings, Paccurate promotes environmental sustainability by advocating for smaller boxes that result in fewer trucks on the road and less waste for customers. The software is flexible and can be integrated at various touchpoints in the order-to-cash process, providing accurate shipping quotes, improving packer efficiency, and automating box-making machines.\\nRelated OurCrowd Portfolio Companies\\nSee all\\nTASE: HICN\\nHighcon\\nSTARTUP\\nFUNDED\\nEnterprise HardwareHighcon has developed the first digital creasing and cutting machine enabling a seamless and cost-effective production process for the folding carton packaging industry.\\nSiteaware\\nSTARTUP\\nFUNDING NOW!\\nEnterprise SoftwareAI-powered quality management platform for construction, generating real-time data, enabling production-line quality, reducing risk, avoiding rework and preventing costly delays\\nXsense (Formerly BT9)\\nSTARTUP\\nFUNDED\\nEnterprise HardwareXsense's supply chain tracking platform offers a full-stack solution for granular monitoring of perishable goods transport.\\nConfidential Deal\\nExclusive for OurCrowd investors\\nJoin For Free\\nor\\nSign In\\nPaccurate at a Glance\\nPaccurate offers cartonization software for efficient shippers.\\nThe software helps optimize packing decisions to save money, materials, and the environment.\\nPaccurate's PacSimulate feature allows users to identify the right carton sizes for their operations.\\nThe company provides an API-first developer quickstart for easy integration.\\nPaccurate reduces transportation spend, corrugated usage, and air shipped, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits.\\nPaccurate News\\nSentiment Score 100\\n(Out of 100 max value)\\nNews Articles 16Positive News Articles 16Neutral News Articles 0Negative News Articles 0\\nPaccurate\\nOct 28, 2024\\nPaccurate’s bid to Reduce Cost and Waste of Parcel Shipping\\nPublisherSupply Chain Digital\\nNews Summary\\nPaccurate has just secured US$8.1m in a Series A funding round led by High Alpha .

funding was led by venture firm High Alpha with participation from Tech Square Ventures, Grand Ventures, HPA (Hyde Park Angels) and more.Paccurate’s patented technology combines advanced cartonization with simulation and monitoring tools, lowering fulfillment costs, reducing waste and ensuring compliance with emerging regulatory requirements for packing efficiency.Early customers include large retailers and shippers such as Daily Harvest, Our Place and Barrett Distribution Centers.NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Paccurate, the packing intelligence platform for parcel shippers, announced today the closing of an $8.1 million Series A funding.The round was led by High Alpha, with participation from Tech Square Ventures, Grand Ventures, HPA (Hyde Park Angels), Las Olas Venture Capital, Springtime Ventures and Royal Street Ventures.As e-commerce continues to grow, and pressure mounts for companies to reduce shipping costs and hit environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, Paccurate’s patented technology enables smarter packing decisions for businesses that both lower costs and enhance sustainability efforts.Using the packing intelligence platform, companies like Daily Harvest, Our Place and Barrett Distribution Centers have reduced Scope-3 emissions, seen up to a 15% reduction in shipping costs and cut corrugate usage by 14%.“The next big shift in supply chain efficiency is simply smarter packing,” said Paccurate Co-Founder and CEO James Malley.“Packing and packaging decisions should be informed not just by empty space, but also by external cost factors like carrier rates, labor, materials and more.Paccurate is the first to provide companies a single platform to identify ideal packaging sizes, and generate packing instructions based on their unique cost factors — saving more money and reducing waste.”Paccurate’s patented technology includes a lightweight API that suggests the optimal packing solution for every shipment.Shippers can also leverage PacSimulate, a powerful analysis tool that identifies ideal carton mixes or other packaging types, and measures the impact of changes to warehouse automation.The complete platform lowers shipping costs, reduces waste and ensures compliance with emerging regulatory requirements for packing efficiency.“Paccurate has developed an innovative and easy-to-use solution that enables companies to optimally pack parcel orders in real time,” said David Mintz, chief supply chain officer for NDC.“The ability to optimize packing based on detailed cost and material factors has led to significant savings while supporting our ESG environmental initiative.Paccurate is fundamentally changing how we think about packing and shipping in the best way possible.”With the new funding, Paccurate will continue to enhance and build upon platform capabilities and features, forge new partnerships with prominent solution providers and support its growing customer base.“Packing optimization is a massive opportunity for shippers and retailers of every size to not only gain an edge in a competitive market, but to stay compliant to evolving regulatory requirements for packing efficiency,” said High Alpha Partner Seth Corder.“We’re excited to support James and the Paccurate team as they continue to build upon their differentiated platform and lead the future of packing intelligence.”Tech Square Ventures Managing Partner and Founder Blake Patton added, “Retail supply chains are facing extraordinary new challenges as consumer demand for e-commerce continues to surge, and packaging has emerged

on:  Tuesday, 22 October 2024  ●  3 Min Read\\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Paccurate, the packing intelligence platform for parcel shippers, announced today the closing of an $8.1 million Series A funding.The round was led by High Alpha, with participation from Tech Square Ventures, Grand Ventures, HPA (Hyde Park Angels), Las Olas Venture Capital, Springtime Ventures and Royal Street Ventures.As e-commerce continues to grow, and pressure mounts for companies to reduce shipping costs and hit environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, Paccurate’s patented technology enables smarter packing decisions for businesses that both lower costs and enhance sustainability efforts.Using the packing intelligence platform, companies like Daily Harvest, Our Place and Barrett Distribution Centers have reduced Scope-3 emissions, seen up to a 15% reduction in shipping costs and cut corrugate usage by 14%.“The next big shift in supply chain efficiency is simply smarter packing,” said Paccurate Co-Founder and CEO James Malley.“Packing and packaging decisions should be informed not just by empty space, but also by external cost factors like carrier rates, labor, materials and more.Paccurate is the first to provide companies a single platform to identify ideal packaging sizes, and generate packing instructions based on their unique cost factors — saving more money and reducing waste.”Paccurate’s patented technology includes a lightweight API that suggests the optimal packing solution for every shipment.Shippers can also leverage PacSimulate, a powerful analysis tool that identifies ideal carton mixes or other packaging types, and measures the impact of changes to warehouse automation.The complete platform lowers shipping costs, reduces waste and ensures compliance with emerging regulatory requirements for packing efficiency.“Paccurate has developed an innovative and easy-to-use solution that enables companies to optimally pack parcel orders in real time,” said David Mintz, chief supply chain officer for NDC.“The ability to optimize packing based on detailed cost and material factors has led to significant savings while supporting our ESG environmental initiative.Paccurate is fundamentally changing how we think about packing and shipping in the best way possible.”With the new funding, Paccurate will continue to enhance and build upon platform capabilities and features, forge new partnerships with prominent solution providers and support its growing customer base.“Packing optimization is a massive opportunity for shippers and retailers of every size to not only gain an edge in a competitive market, but to stay compliant to evolving regulatory requirements for packing efficiency,” said High Alpha Partner Seth Corder.“We’re excited to support James and the Paccurate team as they continue to build upon their differentiated platform and lead the future of packing intelligence.”Tech Square Ventures Managing Partner and Founder Blake Patton added, “Retail supply chains are facing extraordinary new challenges as consumer demand for e-commerce continues to surge, and packaging has emerged as a critical focus area.Paccurate’s consistent innovation around packaging optimization is why we’re excited to deepen our partnership with the team.”About Paccurate\\nPaccurate is a parcel intelligence platform
