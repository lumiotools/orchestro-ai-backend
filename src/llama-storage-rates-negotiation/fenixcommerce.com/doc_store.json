One of the biggest challenges facing e-commerce brands is the complexity of shipping. With so many carriers, rates, delivery times, and regulations to consider, managing the shipping process can be time-consuming, frustrating, and costly. Fortunately, the rise of AI-powered shipping automation is transforming the industry, making it easier than ever for brands to optimize their multi-carrier and parcel rate shopping strategies. \\nWhile at some level, much of the modern shipping process is automated, at FenixCommerce we help streamline decision making for your e-commerce brand. Using our AI, we can simplify your carrier rate shopping by providing the most accurate cost and delivery predictions. In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of shipping automation and how Fenix’s software can help e-commerce brands optimize their shipping process through our AI decision making model.\\nBenefits of Automation\\nOne of the primary benefits of shipping automation is that it can help e-commerce brands select the most cost-effective carrier rate option meeting customer delivery expectations. With so many different carriers to choose from, selecting the right one can be a challenge, especially for brands that are new to the industry. Shipping automation uses AI algorithms to analyze a range of data points, including package dimensions, weight, destination, carrier surcharges, and delivery time, to recommend the best carrier rate option for each shipment. By automating this process, brands can save time and reduce shipping costs, which can help increase their profitability and competitiveness.\\nSimplify Your Brand’s Shipping\\nAnother advantage of shipping automation is that it helps brands consider delivery times and tracking. Customers expect accurate and reliable information about their orders, as Chain Store Age indicates 85% of shoppers will not revisit a webstore after a poor delivery experience. With shipping automation, brands can optimize their shipping processes to ensure fast and reliable delivery, which can help improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, automated tracking and notifications can help brands keep customers informed about their order status, further increasing transparency and improving the customer experience.\\nManaging the complexities of shipping regulations and requirements can be a significant challenge for e-commerce brands. Shipping automation can help by automating compliance checks and ensuring that packages meet all relevant regulations and requirements. This can help brands avoid costly fines and delays and improve their reputation with customers and regulators alike.\\nAutomate Your Brand’s Decision Making\\nOne of the significant benefits of FenixCommerce's software is that it automates decision-making to optimize carrier and parcel rate selection, pre-purchase AND post-purchase. \\\"There is no reason to just use Fedex or just use UPS, you got to really be open to all the carriers,” said Shawn Singh, Founder/CEO of FabricWholesaleDirect.com, in a recent interview. “Businesses should be carrier-agnostic and really prioritize the carrier [service] that is best-fit for each shipment.\\\"\\nSelecting the optimal carrier service for each shipping option pre-purchase, offers the shopper the most accurate estimated delivery date (EDD) at Checkout, increasing conversion and incentivizing upgrades to a faster delivery option, increasing shipping revenue. Then, post-purchase, Fenix can optimize each order and select a less costly Carrier service that meets the same delivery date promised to the shopper at Checkout. \\nOn-Time Delivery is the Goal \\nSeveral WMS/TMS packages offer Rate shopping post-purchase. However, with Fenix, the two-step method of pre- & post-purchase automated carrier service selection provides the highest delivery accuracy at the lowest possible shipping cost to the Retailer, while increasing order fulfillment efficiency. \\nThis capability can easily extend to a Brand’s 3PL or WMS/TMS partners to lower the 3PLs overall shipping costs while increasing the Brand’s satisfaction by delivering ON TIME; not early or late. Additionally, shipping automation can help brands make data-driven decisions, which can help them optimize their shipping strategies over time and adapt to changing market conditions.\\nBe More Accurate than Carriers\\nShipping automation can also help increase transparency with customers and improve EDD accuracy. This is especially true as more e-commerce brands utilize inexpensive shipping services like UPS Sure Post or FedEx Ground Economy, for their Free or Standard shipping. These are the hardest to predict as after order confirmation even the Carriers’ own EDD’s are accurate less than 70% of the time.  \\nDon’t rely on Carriers to build trust with your customers. By automating the shipping process, brands can offer highly accurate EDDs (94%+) pre-purchase, for all services and provide real-time tracking information to customers, allowing them to monitor their package's progress and receive updates about any delays or issues. \\nWork With Fenix Today\\nIn conclusion, shipping automation is a powerful tool for e-commerce brands looking to optimize their shipping process. By using AI to automate shipping decisions, brands can save time, reduce costs, improve efficiency, and increase transparency with customers. FenixCommerce's software is an excellent example of how shipping automation can help e-commerce brands stay competitive and adapt to changing market conditions. \\nFREE Assessment\\nAnd Fenix backs up this claim with a FREE Assessment of Multi-Carrier Parcel shipping spend, offered to any Retailer/DTC Brand with at least 10K shipments/month.  Recently, Fenix’s proprietary Rate-simulator decision-engine revealed 18% savings in Carrier costs ($2.56/shipment for affected orders) for a large Shopify DTC footwear apparel brand, from just one month’s worth of shipping data history. Take advantage of this free assessment to see how automating carrier-service shipping decisions can reduce costs.\\nAs e-commerce continues to grow, brands that embrace shipping automation will be better positioned to succeed in the years ahead.\\nAuthor: Akhilesh Srivastava\\nFounder and CEO of FenixCommerce\\nFollow on :\\nShare Articles\\nTalk to our Consultant\\nRecommended Articles\\nWhy Showing Estimated Delivery Dates on Product Pages is Crucial...\\nNovember 18, 2024\\nQuick Read\\nWhy the Holiday Season is the Best Time to Improve...\\nNovember 17, 2024\\nQuick Read\\nBlack Friday: A Critical Sales Event for eCommerce Brands\\nNovember 17, 2024\\nQuick Read\\nView All Blogs\\nPLATFORM\\nPLATFORM OVERVIEW\\nESTIMATED DELIVERY DATES\\nMULTI-CARRIER PARCEL MANAGEMENT\\nPOST-PURCHASE DELIVERY STATUS\\nCOMPANY\\nOUR STORY\\nCLIENTS\\nPARTNERS\\nCAREERS\\nCONTACT US\\nRESOURCES\\nBLOG\\nVIDEOS\\nDEVELOPER DOCS\\nLEGAL\\nTRUST CENTER\\nFOLLOW US\\nTerms of Service\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCopyright © 2023 FenixCommerce Inc.| All rights reserved.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"/GApxCpV+kHFzZ9AHReZj+wrpiwvWLGVqx6m+iVOrtM=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"caf51288-1aba-40a4-acc8-5bf2f9909480":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"caf51288-1aba-40a4-acc8-5bf2f9909480\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://fenixcommerce.com/how-to-lower-shipping-costs-on-shopify/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Platform\\nResources\\nAbout Us\\nInstall Shopify App\\nAugust, 13 2024\\nHow to Lower Shipping Costs on Shopify\\nReducing shipping costs is a top priority for many Shopify retailers. With various strategies and smart planning, you can significantly lower your shipping expenses, ultimately enhancing your profit margins and providing better value to your customers. Here are some effective methods:\\nEvaluate Different Carriers and Rates\\nOne of the first steps in minimizing shipping costs is to evaluate various shipping carriers. Each carrier has its unique rate structure, and sometimes even minor differences in weight or dimensions can significantly alter the costs. Platforms like Shopify allow you to integrate with multiple carriers such as USPS, FedEx, and UPS. By comparing their rates for different shipping zones, you can opt for the most cost-effective option for your business.\\nNegotiate Better Rates with Shipping Carriers\\nIf your business ships substantial volumes regularly, you may have leverage to negotiate with shipping carriers. Carriers are often open to providing better rates to ensure continued or increased business. It's a good idea to contact carrier representatives directly to discuss volume-based discounts or long-term contracts that could benefit both parties.\\nUse Shopify Shipping for Discounted Rates\\nShopify Shipping provides built-in access to discounted rates with major carriers. This feature may offer you lower prices than you could secure on your own, especially for small to medium-sized businesses. Taking advantage of these pre-negotiated rates can streamline your shipping process and reduce costs effectively.\\nGet Insights for Your Brand\\nTalk to Our Consultant\\nImplement Tiered Pricing Based on Order Value or Weight\\nAn intelligent way to manage shipping costs is to implement tiered pricing. Set different shipping rates based on the order value or weight of the items. For instance, you could offer free or discounted shipping for orders above a specific dollar amount or apply weight-based rates to accurately reflect shipping costs. This not only helps in recouping shipping expenses but also encourages customers to make larger purchases.\\nHow to Get Shipping Costs Down\\nFor small businesses and eCommerce retailers, reducing shipping costs can significantly impact profitability. Here are several strategies to help you get your shipping expenses under control.\\nLeverage Bulk Shipping Discounts\\nOne of the most effective ways to get your shipping costs down is to leverage bulk shipping discounts. Contact your shipping carriers and inquire about volume-based pricing. Many parcel carriers offer reduced rates for businesses that ship a high volume of packages. This tactic can yield substantial savings, especially during peak shopping seasons.\\nStreamline Packaging to Reduce Dimensional Weight\\nOptimizing your packaging can also reduce shipping costs significantly. Carriers often determine shipping prices based on dimensional weight, which considers the package size along with its actual weight. Use the right-sized boxes and consider packing materials that minimize the overall package size. This approach not only saves money but also benefits the environment by reducing waste.\\nOptimize Supply Chain Logistics\\nEnhancing your supply chain logistics can further help reduce shipping costs. By strategically placing inventory in multiple warehouses or fulfillment centers close to your primary customer base, you can shorten shipping distances and cut costs. This can also lead to faster delivery times, which can enhance customer satisfaction.\\nConsider Third-Party Shipping Solutions\\nThird-party shipping solutions, such as shipping aggregators or logistics companies, can provide significant savings on postage. These platforms often have pre-negotiated rates with multiple carriers, allowing you to benefit from lower shipping costs without large volume commitments. Evaluate different third-party providers to find the best fit for your business.\\nHow to Get Cheaper Postage\\nRetailers and eCommerce businesses using Shopify often find that postage costs can significantly affect their profitability. Fortunately, there are several strategies to lower those costs. Understanding how to get cheaper postage can make a substantial difference in operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.\\nUse the Shopify Shipping Rates Calculator\\nOne of the most effective tools at your disposal is the Shopify shipping rates calculator. This tool allows you to input the weight, dimensions, and destination of your package, providing an accurate estimate of the shipping cost. By using the calculator, you can identify the most cost-effective shipping options available. It can also help you to transparently pass on shipping costs to customers or to strategize on offering free shipping by incorporating those costs into product pricing.\\nExplore Regional Shipping Options\\nAnother method to achieve cheaper postage is by exploring regional shipping options. Many carriers offer specific regional shipping rates that are significantly lower than national rates, particularly for deliveries within a certain geographic area. By selecting carriers that provide such rates, you can take advantage of lower costs for local deliveries. This is particularly useful for businesses with a locally concentrated customer base.\\nGet notified about our upcoming blogs\\nFollow us\\nUtilize Shipping Consolidators\\nConnecting with shipping consolidators can also reduce your postage costs. Shipping consolidators buy postage in bulk from carriers and pass on the savings to their customers. By consolidating your shipments with those of other businesses, you can benefit from bulk rates without having to increase your own shipping volume. This approach is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses that can't yet negotiate bulk rates directly with carriers.\\nTake Advantage of Promotional Shipping Discounts\\nFinally, always be on the lookout for promotional shipping discounts. Many carriers offer temporary discounts around peak shipping seasons or special business promotions. Signing up for newsletters and checking carrier websites regularly can provide opportunities to take advantage of these discounts, significantly lowering your shipping expenses during promotion periods.\\nHow to Save Delivery Costs\\nLowering delivery costs is a pivotal concern for eCommerce businesses and retailers using Shopify. By implementing strategic measures, you can significantly reduce your shipping expenses and pass these savings on to your customers, enhancing their purchase experience and boosting your business's profitability.\\nImplement Flat Rate Shipping\\nOne effective method to save on delivery costs is to implement flat rate shipping. By setting a single shipping rate for all orders, regardless of size or weight, you can simplify your shipping process and make shipping costs more predictable for both you and your customers. This approach can particularly benefit businesses with relatively uniform product sizes and weights.\\nPass on Savings from Negotiated Rates\\nAnother strategy is to negotiate better shipping rates with carriers and pass these savings on to your customers. Shopify offers discounted rates through partnerships with major carriers, and utilizing these can help reduce shipping and delivery costs. Additionally, frequent shippers can often negotiate directly with carriers for even better rates.\\nOffer Local Pickup or In-Store Drop-Off\\nOffering local pickup or in-store drop-off options can also help save on shipping costs. This option can be particularly appealing to local customers who are willing to visit your physical location. Not only does this save on shipping costs, but it also provides an opportunity to build stronger customer relationships by offering a more personalized shopping experience.\\nIncorporate Free Shipping Thresholds\\nIncorporating free shipping thresholds is another tactic to consider. By setting a minimum purchase amount for free shipping, you can encourage customers to add more items to their cart, thereby increasing your average order value while still managing to cover the shipping costs effectively. This strategy can also enhance customer satisfaction by reducing the cost burden they perceive.\\nEach of these strategies requires careful consideration of your business's unique needs and customer base. By employing a combination of these tactics, you can effectively manage and reduce your delivery costs, leading to improved profitability and customer satisfaction.\\nAbout FenixCommerce\\nAt FenixCommerce, we specialize in transforming your eCommerce shipping experience by leveraging advanced technology and industry expertise.

One of the significant challenges faced by retailers is managing shipping costs effectively. This is where carrier rate shopping comes into play. But why is it so crucial for retailers in 2024?\\nChallenges Faced by Retailers\\nRetailers today face numerous challenges, from rising operational costs to heightened customer expectations. One of the primary pain points is optimizing shipping costs while ensuring timely delivery. With a plethora of shipping carriers offering various rates and services, it becomes increasingly complex to choose the best option.

This complexity necessitates the need for an effective carrier rate shopping strategy.\\nBenefits of Carrier Rate Shopping\\nImplementing a strategic approach to carrier rate shopping can yield numerous benefits for retailers. Primarily, it allows for significant shipping cost optimization. By comparing rates from multiple carriers in real-time, retailers can select the most cost-effective option for each shipment, thereby reducing overall shipping expenses. Moreover, this approach helps in enhancing delivery speed and reliability as retailers can choose the carrier best suited for specific delivery requirements.\\nFurthermore, carrier rate shopping aids in improving customer satisfaction. With access to the best shipping rates and services, retailers can offer more flexible and affordable shipping options to customers, leading to a better overall shopping experience. This, in turn, can increase customer loyalty and repeat business.\\nCase Studies of Successful Implementations\\nSeveral retailers have successfully integrated carrier rate shopping solutions into their logistics operations, reaping substantial benefits. For instance, an e-commerce retailer specializing in electronics utilized an automated carrier rate shopping platform. This allowed them to reduce shipping costs by 20% while maintaining fast delivery times. Another example is a fashion retailer that used a multi-carrier shipping platform to provide customers with real-time shipping options and accurate delivery estimates, significantly boosting customer satisfaction and sales.\\nThese case studies highlight the tangible benefits of adopting a carrier rate shopping strategy, making it an indispensable tool for retailers aiming to stay competitive in 2024 and beyond.\\nKey Technologies and Platforms for Shipping Optimization\\nIn the increasingly competitive e-commerce landscape, the use of advanced shipping technologies has become a necessity for retailers aiming to optimize their logistics and delivery processes.

There are so many challenges that make it hard to get your products to your customers on time. That’s why you must seek proactive shipping solutions.\\nSeeing that the landscape has become much harder for retailers and  brands to thrive, the big question remains: “how can retailers keep shipping in a way that elevates the customer experience, improves their journey, and guarantees their satisfaction?”\\nOf course, your ability to get it right with shipping goes a long way to boost your eCommerce conversion rate. But, before we provide shipping solutions to the questions posed above, let’s first consider the current shipping challenges facing retailers.\\nWhat Shipping Challenges Are Retailers Up Against?\\nSeveral problems exist for virtually every fast-growing eCommerce business out there, but we will highlight 4 of the major issues in this piece, including:\\nCarrier duopoly\\nInability to benchmark rates\\nThe amazon effect\\nDemand exceeds supply\\nProblem #1 - Carrier duopoly\\nThe biggest shipping carriers right now are companies like FedEx and UPS, and what we've noticed in recent years is that these two shippers operate in lockstep. So whenever FedEx implements an increase in surcharge, peak surcharge, fuel surcharge, and more, UPS goes ahead to copy and implement the exact same thing.\\nNow, this happens multiple times throughout the year, not just in January alone when rates tend to increase in general. FedEx recently raised the fuel surcharge, and UPS went on to mirror that increase. \\nIn the minds of online retailers, after observing these lockstep patterns, it’s almost like the shipping carriers are holding all the cards here with rates continuing to increase. \\nProblem #2 - Inability to benchmark rates\\nDo you have the ability to benchmark your rates? How can you even tell if you have the best-negotiated rates possible and if what you are getting is accurate? \\nThe thing is, right now, when you look at the carrier agreements from shippers like FedEx and UPS, you will notice that there are around 250 data points to consider. But you also have other competing, but smaller shippers who offer different rates as well.\\nThe existing challenge for many eCommerce businesses right now is that they have no way to tell if the current rates they’re getting from these bigger shippers are optimized well enough against the competition. \\nProblem #3 - The Amazon effect\\nYet another big challenge for online retailers is the ever-growing demands of shoppers, especially since the end of the pandemic. Customers are demanding free shipping. They also want their shipping to be fast and cheap. \\nIn general, today’s shoppers now expect to never have to pay for shipping and that's because companies like Amazon have set the stage for such expectations. Since customers are unwilling to pay for shipping, eCommerce brands are in a sort of dilemma to decide their strategy and figure out how to meet such demands through their logistics profile. \\nRetailers have to find a way to deliver orders fast and at a minimal cost, in order to reduce abandoned carts and increase conversion rates.\\nProblem #4 - Demand exceeds supply\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted buying habits, changing the landscape. Buying volume online has increased so much that it’s now causing numerous shipping challenges for retailers. Some of such challenges include slower transit times, surcharges, capacity constraints, etc. \\nThe 5 to 7-year growth projections for eCommerce have been exceeded already and we anticipate more increases. So retailers must find a way to keep up since UPS and FedEx can’t handle all this volume. \\nHow Retailers can Tackle These Challenges and Keep Shipping Profitably \\nAmidst these ever-present challenges facing eCommerce brands, what other options are out there in addition to FedEx and UPS? How can retailers remedy these challenges using shipping solutions to reduce abandoned carts and keep shipping profitably?\\n3 ways that retailers can become proactive and go on to increase their eCommerce conversions in spite of these issues include:\\nDon’t use single-source shipping\\nDisplay the most competitive shipping options at checkout\\nImprove the post-purchase experience\\nSolution #1 - Don’t use single-source shipping\\nWith more consumers shopping online, your customers are scattered around different locations. Using just one carrier to handle your shipping needs could be doing your business more harm than good. You want to evolve from being single-source and start exploring better ways to optimize your shipping logistics. \\nRather than stay confined to one carrier, explore more options from other shippers that help you save on shipping costs and time while increasing last-mile delivery speed. Here are some tips:\\nUse consolidated shipping solutions: Using split shipments to deliver faster will only cost you more in shipping fees while increasing wasted packages which isn’t environmentally friendly. Consider opting for consolidated shipping services to help reduce shipping rates and boost customer service. \\nExplore regional carriers: Regional shippers help to shorten the delivery time since they have a smaller operation scope. The fact that they are familiar with the routes in a specific region gives your customers greater flexibility as well. \\nTake advantage of zone shipping: Have more fulfillment centers around your customer bases and ship from wherever the majority of your customers are located.\\nSolution #2 - Display the most competitive shipping options at checkout\\nWhen shoppers hop on your site, they are not just trying to find the best products alone. They also want to figure out how to get the fastest shipping and lowest cost options at the checkout. That's because retailers who offer the most competitive costs at checkout are the ones who go on to convert higher. Online stores with hidden costs or high shipping rates eventually lose such customers at checkout, ultimately hurting their conversions and increasing cart abandonment rates. \\nTo solve that problem, it makes sense to start leveraging an eCommerce automation solution that monitors the shipping rates from different carriers in real time.\\nFenixCommerce was built to do just that. Our shipping and delivery software uses real-time rates from carriers to display accurate delivery dates and multiple shipping options on your product, cart, and checkout pages. All pickup and delivery options displayed are tailored to the location of the individual customer to create a more personalized experience.  \\nSee how Road iD was able to increase conversions up to 17% by displaying the most cost-effective shipping options to customers using Fenix.\\nSolution #3 - Improve the post-purchase experience\\nYour connection with customers doesn’t just end once you get them through checkout. You must keep the experience enriched until the final delivery. That’s why it makes sense to optimize your post-purchase phase. For example, customers want the ability to track their orders, so make sure to offer order tracking and keep customers updated regularly about their packages until the delivery gets completed.\\nWith a smooth after-purchase experience, such customers are bound to return to your online store again the next time they need to shop or replenish their supplies. That’s how you earn customer loyalty and drive conversions. Fortunately, Fenix also provides branded order tracking services for retailers to make sure you’re creating an immersive end-to-end customer experience. \\nConvert Higher by Utilizing Shipping Solutions Today \\nBeing open to alternative shipping solutions can be the game-changer that helps reduce shipping costs and improve overall customer service levels. At FenixCommerce, we are constantly creating software that helps retailers sell more and reduce abandoned carts arising from shipping and delivery challenges.

remain competitive.One of the biggest challenges facing e-commerce brands is the complexity of shipping.With so many carriers, rates, delivery times, and regulations to consider, managing the shipping process can be time-consuming, frustrating, and costly.Fortunately, the rise of AI-powered shipping automation is transforming the industry, making it easier than ever for brands to optimize their multi-carrier and parcel rate shopping strategies.While at some level, much of the modern shipping process is automated, at FenixCommerce we help streamline decision making for your e-commerce brand.Using our AI, we can simplify your carrier rate shopping by providing the most accurate cost and delivery predictions.In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of shipping automation and how Fenix’s software can help e-commerce brands optimize their shipping process through our AI decision making model.Benefits of Automation\\nOne of the primary benefits of shipping automation is that it can help e-commerce brands select the most cost-effective carrier rate option meeting customer delivery expectations.With so many different carriers to choose from, selecting the right one can be a challenge, especially for brands that are new to the industry.Shipping automation uses AI algorithms to analyze a range of data points, including package dimensions, weight, destination, carrier surcharges, and delivery time, to recommend the best carrier rate option for each shipment.By automating this process, brands can save time and reduce shipping costs, which can help increase their profitability and competitiveness.Simplify Your Brand’s Shipping\\nAnother advantage of shipping automation is that it helps brands consider delivery times and tracking.Customers expect accurate and reliable information about their orders, as Chain Store Age indicates 85% of shoppers will not revisit a webstore after a poor delivery experience.With shipping automation, brands can optimize their shipping processes to ensure fast and reliable delivery, which can help improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.Additionally, automated tracking and notifications can help brands keep customers informed about their order status, further increasing transparency and improving the customer experience.Managing the complexities of shipping regulations and requirements can be a significant challenge for e-commerce brands.Shipping automation can help by automating compliance checks and ensuring that packages meet all relevant regulations and requirements.This can help brands avoid costly fines and delays and improve their reputation with customers and regulators alike.Automate Your Brand’s Decision Making\\nOne of the significant benefits of FenixCommerce's software is that it automates decision-making to optimize carrier and parcel rate selection, pre-purchase AND post-purchase.\\\"There is no reason to just use Fedex or just use UPS, you got to really be open to all the carriers,” said Shawn Singh, Founder/CEO of FabricWholesaleDirect.com, in a recent interview.“Businesses should be carrier-agnostic and really prioritize the carrier [service] that is best-fit for each shipment.\\\"Selecting the optimal carrier service for each shipping option pre-purchase, offers the shopper the most accurate estimated delivery date (EDD) at Checkout, increasing conversion and incentivizing upgrades to a faster delivery option, increasing shipping revenue.Then, post-purchase, Fenix can optimize each order and select a less costly Carrier service that meets the same delivery date promised to the shopper at Checkout.On-Time Delivery is the Goal \\nSeveral WMS/TMS packages offer Rate shopping post-purchase.However, with Fenix, the two-step method of pre- & post-purchase automated carrier service selection provides the highest delivery accuracy at the lowest possible shipping cost to the Retailer, while increasing order fulfillment efficiency.This capability can easily extend to a Brand’s 3PL or WMS/TMS partners to lower the 3PLs overall shipping costs while increasing the Brand’s satisfaction by delivering ON TIME; not early or late.Additionally, shipping automation can help brands make data-driven decisions, which can help them optimize their shipping strategies over time and adapt to changing market conditions.Be More Accurate than Carriers\\nShipping automation can also help increase transparency with customers and improve EDD accuracy.This is especially true as more e-commerce brands utilize inexpensive shipping services like UPS Sure Post or FedEx Ground Economy, for their Free or Standard shipping.These are the hardest to predict as after order confirmation even the Carriers’ own EDD’s are accurate less than 70% of the time.Don’t rely on Carriers to build trust with your customers.By automating the shipping process, brands can offer highly accurate EDDs (94%+) pre-purchase, for all services and provide real-time tracking information to customers, allowing them to monitor their package's progress and receive updates about any delays or issues.Work With Fenix Today\\nIn conclusion, shipping automation is a powerful tool for e-commerce brands looking to optimize their shipping process.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"6jujyL2eQSJaIM8QS8JmSVc8eNv64twGEJiyrjlR9LA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"7fd73889-8b20-41d0-b60e-655517e5952d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"7fd73889-8b20-41d0-b60e-655517e5952d\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://fenixcommerce.com/rate-shopping-through-shipping-automation/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"5cac3757-af61-40fe-9362-297bde6c4aa8\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://fenixcommerce.com/rate-shopping-through-shipping-automation/\"},\"hash\":\"/GApxCpV+kHFzZ9AHReZj+wrpiwvWLGVqx6m+iVOrtM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"31af6419-8b29-4e08-a1b5-f3daff9dcbf1\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://fenixcommerce.com/rate-shopping-through-shipping-automation/\"},\"hash\":\"6jujyL2eQSJaIM8QS8JmSVc8eNv64twGEJiyrjlR9LA=\"}},\"text\":\"Be

conditions.FREE Assessment\\nAnd Fenix backs up this claim with a FREE Assessment of Multi-Carrier Parcel shipping spend, offered to any Retailer/DTC Brand with at least 10K shipments/month.Recently, Fenix’s proprietary Rate-simulator decision-engine revealed 18% savings in Carrier costs ($2.56/shipment for affected orders) for a large Shopify DTC footwear apparel brand, from just one month’s worth of shipping data history.Take advantage of this free assessment to see how automating carrier-service shipping decisions can reduce costs.As e-commerce continues to grow, brands that embrace shipping automation will be better positioned to succeed in the years ahead.Author: Akhilesh Srivastava\\nFounder and CEO of FenixCommerce\\nFollow on :\\nShare Articles\\nTalk to our

Us\\nInstall Shopify App\\nAugust, 13 2024\\nHow to Lower Shipping Costs on Shopify\\nReducing shipping costs is a top priority for many Shopify retailers.With various strategies and smart planning, you can significantly lower your shipping expenses, ultimately enhancing your profit margins and providing better value to your customers.Here are some effective methods:\\nEvaluate Different Carriers and Rates\\nOne of the first steps in minimizing shipping costs is to evaluate various shipping carriers.Each carrier has its unique rate structure, and sometimes even minor differences in weight or dimensions can significantly alter the costs.Platforms like Shopify allow you to integrate with multiple carriers such as USPS, FedEx, and UPS.By comparing their rates for different shipping zones, you can opt for the most cost-effective option for your business.Negotiate Better Rates with Shipping Carriers\\nIf your business ships substantial volumes regularly, you may have leverage to negotiate with shipping carriers.Carriers are often open to providing better rates to ensure continued or increased business.It's a good idea to contact carrier representatives directly to discuss volume-based discounts or long-term contracts that could benefit both parties.Use Shopify Shipping for Discounted Rates\\nShopify Shipping provides built-in access to discounted rates with major carriers.This feature may offer you lower prices than you could secure on your own, especially for small to medium-sized businesses.Taking advantage of these pre-negotiated rates can streamline your shipping process and reduce costs effectively.Get Insights for Your Brand\\nTalk to Our Consultant\\nImplement Tiered Pricing Based on Order Value or Weight\\nAn intelligent way to manage shipping costs is to implement tiered pricing.Set different shipping rates based on the order value or weight of the items.For instance, you could offer free or discounted shipping for orders above a specific dollar amount or apply weight-based rates to accurately reflect shipping costs.This not only helps in recouping shipping expenses but also encourages customers to make larger purchases.How to Get Shipping Costs Down\\nFor small businesses and eCommerce retailers, reducing shipping costs can significantly impact profitability.Here are several strategies to help you get your shipping expenses under control.Leverage Bulk Shipping Discounts\\nOne of the most effective ways to get your shipping costs down is to leverage bulk shipping discounts.Contact your shipping carriers and inquire about volume-based pricing.Many parcel carriers offer reduced rates for businesses that ship a high volume of packages.This tactic can yield substantial savings, especially during peak shopping seasons.Streamline Packaging to Reduce Dimensional Weight\\nOptimizing your packaging can also reduce shipping costs significantly.Carriers often determine shipping prices based on dimensional weight, which considers the package size along with its actual weight.Use the right-sized boxes and consider packing materials that minimize the overall package size.This approach not only saves money but also benefits the environment by reducing waste.Optimize Supply Chain Logistics\\nEnhancing your supply chain logistics can further help reduce shipping costs.By strategically placing inventory in multiple warehouses or fulfillment centers close to your primary customer base, you can shorten shipping distances and cut costs.This can also lead to faster delivery times, which can enhance customer satisfaction.Consider Third-Party Shipping Solutions\\nThird-party shipping solutions, such as shipping aggregators or logistics companies, can provide significant savings on postage.These platforms often have pre-negotiated rates with multiple carriers, allowing you to benefit from lower shipping costs without large volume commitments.Evaluate different third-party providers to find the best fit for your business.How to Get Cheaper Postage\\nRetailers and eCommerce businesses using Shopify often find that postage costs can significantly affect their profitability.Fortunately, there are several strategies to lower those costs.Understanding how to get cheaper postage can make a substantial difference in operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.Use the Shopify Shipping Rates Calculator\\nOne of the most effective tools at your disposal is the Shopify shipping rates calculator.This tool allows you to input the weight, dimensions, and destination of your package, providing an accurate estimate of the shipping cost.By using the calculator, you can identify the most cost-effective shipping options available.It can also help you to transparently pass on shipping costs to customers or to strategize on offering free shipping by incorporating those costs into product pricing.Explore Regional Shipping Options\\nAnother method to achieve cheaper postage is by exploring regional shipping options.Many carriers offer specific regional shipping rates that are significantly lower than national rates, particularly for deliveries within a certain geographic area.By selecting carriers that provide such rates, you can take advantage of lower costs for local deliveries.This is particularly useful for businesses with a locally concentrated customer base.Get notified

carriers and pass on the savings to their customers.By consolidating your shipments with those of other businesses, you can benefit from bulk rates without having to increase your own shipping volume.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"rd+k+yhqanOAigXoa6KQmXwwdTH/AkZbEiwVczhLmf0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0de6b739-9c24-4157-b078-0d823f6b83a1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0de6b739-9c24-4157-b078-0d823f6b83a1\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://fenixcommerce.com/how-to-lower-shipping-costs-on-shopify/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"caf51288-1aba-40a4-acc8-5bf2f9909480\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://fenixcommerce.com/how-to-lower-shipping-costs-on-shopify/\"},\"hash\":\"M3OLzBOnq8WV8THVTKuuDjkmoRe3PK0gFKm8QF+K3dc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"bc0d75ac-05ae-4d3e-965a-2e262588f898\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://fenixcommerce.com/how-to-lower-shipping-costs-on-shopify/\"},\"hash\":\"rd+k+yhqanOAigXoa6KQmXwwdTH/AkZbEiwVczhLmf0=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ca9a4a6b-8951-477a-a16a-e1b0a1f88af8\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"yi0msdM2cyfSVckfTMKgHcObYyIk8glDraOHWt+aqYg=\"}},\"text\":\"By

customers.By consolidating your shipments with those of other businesses, you can benefit from bulk rates without having to increase your own shipping volume.This approach is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses that can't yet negotiate bulk rates directly with carriers.Take Advantage of Promotional Shipping Discounts\\nFinally, always be on the lookout for promotional shipping discounts.Many carriers offer temporary discounts around peak shipping seasons or special business promotions.Signing up for newsletters and checking carrier websites regularly can provide opportunities to take advantage of these discounts, significantly lowering your shipping expenses during promotion periods.How to Save Delivery Costs\\nLowering delivery costs is a pivotal concern for eCommerce businesses and retailers using Shopify.By implementing strategic measures, you can significantly reduce your shipping expenses and pass these savings on to your customers, enhancing their purchase experience and boosting your business's profitability.Implement Flat Rate Shipping\\nOne effective method to save on delivery costs is to implement flat rate shipping.By setting a single shipping rate for all orders, regardless of size or weight, you can simplify your shipping process and make shipping costs more predictable for both you and your customers.This approach can particularly benefit businesses with relatively uniform product sizes and weights.Pass on Savings from Negotiated Rates\\nAnother strategy is to negotiate better shipping rates with carriers and pass these savings on to your customers.Shopify offers discounted rates through partnerships with major carriers, and utilizing these can help reduce shipping and delivery costs.Additionally, frequent shippers can often negotiate directly with carriers for even better rates.Offer Local Pickup or In-Store Drop-Off\\nOffering local pickup or in-store drop-off options can also help save on shipping costs.This option can be particularly appealing to local customers who are willing to visit your physical location.Not only does this save on shipping costs, but it also provides an opportunity to build stronger customer relationships by offering a more personalized shopping experience.Incorporate Free Shipping Thresholds\\nIncorporating free shipping thresholds is another tactic to consider.By setting a minimum purchase amount for free shipping, you can encourage customers to add more items to their cart, thereby increasing your average order value while still managing to cover the shipping costs effectively.This strategy can also enhance customer satisfaction by reducing the cost burden they perceive.Each of these strategies requires careful consideration of your business's unique needs and customer base.By employing a combination of these tactics, you can effectively manage and reduce your delivery costs, leading to improved profitability and customer satisfaction.About

for Retailers in 2024 - The Why\\nThe e-commerce landscape is evolving rapidly, and with it, the expectations of both retailers and consumers.One of the significant challenges faced by retailers is managing shipping costs effectively.This is where carrier rate shopping comes into play.But why is it so crucial for retailers in 2024?Challenges Faced by Retailers\\nRetailers today face numerous challenges, from rising operational costs to heightened customer expectations.One of the primary pain points is optimizing shipping costs while ensuring timely delivery.With a plethora of shipping carriers offering various rates and services, it becomes increasingly complex to choose the best option.Additionally, fluctuating carrier rates can make it difficult for retailers to offer competitive shipping rates to customers.This complexity necessitates the need for an effective carrier rate shopping strategy.Benefits of Carrier Rate Shopping\\nImplementing a strategic approach to carrier rate shopping can yield numerous benefits for retailers.Primarily, it allows for significant shipping cost optimization.By comparing rates from multiple carriers in real-time, retailers can select the most cost-effective option for each shipment, thereby reducing overall shipping expenses.Moreover, this approach helps in enhancing delivery speed and reliability as retailers can choose the carrier best suited for specific delivery requirements.Furthermore, carrier rate shopping aids in improving customer satisfaction.With access to the best shipping rates and services, retailers can offer more

today.There are so many challenges that make it hard to get your products to your customers on time.That’s why you must seek proactive shipping solutions.Seeing that the landscape has become much harder for retailers and  brands to thrive, the big question remains: “how can retailers keep shipping in a way that elevates the customer experience, improves their journey, and guarantees their satisfaction?”Of course, your ability to get it right with shipping goes a long way to boost your eCommerce conversion rate.But, before we provide shipping solutions to the questions posed above, let’s first consider the current shipping challenges facing retailers.What Shipping Challenges Are Retailers Up Against?Several problems exist for virtually every fast-growing eCommerce business out there, but we will highlight 4 of the major issues in this piece, including:\\nCarrier duopoly\\nInability to benchmark rates\\nThe amazon effect\\nDemand exceeds supply\\nProblem #1 - Carrier duopoly\\nThe biggest shipping carriers right now are companies like FedEx and UPS, and what we've noticed in recent years is that these two shippers operate in lockstep.So whenever FedEx implements an increase in surcharge, peak surcharge, fuel surcharge, and more, UPS goes ahead to copy and implement the exact same thing.Now, this happens multiple times throughout the year, not just in January alone when rates tend to increase in general.FedEx recently raised the fuel surcharge, and UPS went on to mirror that increase.In the minds of online retailers, after observing these lockstep patterns, it’s almost like the shipping carriers are holding all the cards here with rates continuing to increase.Problem #2 - Inability to benchmark rates\\nDo you have the ability to benchmark your rates?How can you even tell if you have the best-negotiated rates possible and if what you are getting is accurate?The thing is, right now, when you look at the carrier agreements from shippers like FedEx and UPS, you will notice that there are around 250 data points to consider.But you also have other competing, but smaller shippers who offer different rates as well.The existing challenge for many eCommerce businesses right now is that they have no way to tell if the current rates they’re getting from these bigger shippers are optimized well enough against the competition.Problem #3 - The Amazon effect\\nYet another big challenge for online retailers is the ever-growing demands of shoppers, especially since the end of the pandemic.Customers are demanding free shipping.They also want their shipping to be fast and cheap.In general, today’s shoppers now expect to never have to pay for shipping and that's because companies like Amazon have set the stage for such expectations.Since customers are unwilling to pay for shipping, eCommerce brands are in a sort of dilemma to decide their strategy and figure out how to meet such demands through their logistics profile.Retailers have to find a way to deliver orders fast and at a minimal cost, in order to reduce abandoned carts and increase conversion rates.Problem #4 - Demand exceeds supply\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted buying habits, changing the landscape.Buying volume online has increased so much that it’s now causing numerous shipping challenges for retailers.Some of such challenges include slower transit times, surcharges, capacity constraints, etc. \\nThe 5 to 7-year growth projections for eCommerce have been exceeded already and we anticipate more increases.So retailers must find a way to keep up since UPS and FedEx can’t handle all this volume.How Retailers can Tackle These Challenges and Keep Shipping Profitably \\nAmidst these ever-present challenges facing eCommerce brands, what other options are out there in addition to FedEx and UPS?How can retailers remedy these challenges using shipping solutions to reduce abandoned carts and keep shipping profitably?3 ways that retailers can become proactive and go on to increase their eCommerce conversions in spite of these issues include:\\nDon’t use single-source shipping\\nDisplay the most competitive shipping options at checkout\\nImprove the post-purchase experience\\nSolution #1 - Don’t use single-source shipping\\nWith more consumers shopping online, your customers are scattered around different locations.Using just one carrier to handle your shipping needs could be doing your business more harm than good.You want to evolve from being single-source and start exploring better ways to optimize your shipping logistics.Rather than stay confined to one carrier, explore more options from other shippers that help you save on shipping costs and time while increasing last-mile delivery speed.Here are some tips:\\nUse consolidated shipping solutions: Using split shipments to deliver faster will only cost you more in shipping fees while increasing wasted packages which isn’t environmentally friendly.Consider opting for consolidated shipping services to help reduce shipping rates and boost customer service.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"1LV2q/uUaWS0QjjC/X4ElpIaBXZP5dsLNXpAZM6FUhc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3dc50a8c-75f5-497c-9d0f-a04aa3c29b4f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3dc50a8c-75f5-497c-9d0f-a04aa3c29b4f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://fenixcommerce.com/how-to-utilize-shipping-solutions-to-impact-ecommerce-conversions/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"12ba4972-1bec-4401-8340-41d7ba7b6405\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://fenixcommerce.com/how-to-utilize-shipping-solutions-to-impact-ecommerce-conversions/\"},\"hash\":\"/FGqIknoBWNwHSAKQLCahLCQcrIdaq60CHPNVP0+vT0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"39330f31-6eaa-4985-8780-83062c070fed\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://fenixcommerce.com/how-to-utilize-shipping-solutions-to-impact-ecommerce-conversions/\"},\"hash\":\"1LV2q/uUaWS0QjjC/X4ElpIaBXZP5dsLNXpAZM6FUhc=\"}},\"text\":\"3

friendly.Consider opting for consolidated shipping services to help reduce shipping rates and boost customer service.Explore regional carriers: Regional shippers help to shorten the delivery time since they have a smaller operation scope.The fact that they are familiar with the routes in a specific region gives your customers greater flexibility as well.Take advantage of zone shipping: Have more fulfillment centers around your customer bases and ship from wherever the majority of your customers are located.Solution #2 - Display the most competitive shipping options at checkout\\nWhen shoppers hop on your site, they are not just trying to find the best products alone.They also want to figure out how to get the fastest shipping and lowest cost options at the checkout.That's because retailers who offer the most competitive costs at checkout are the ones who go on to convert higher.Online stores with hidden costs or high shipping rates eventually lose such customers at checkout, ultimately hurting their conversions and increasing cart abandonment rates.To solve that problem, it makes sense to start leveraging an eCommerce automation solution that monitors the shipping rates from different carriers in real time.FenixCommerce was built to do just that.Our shipping and delivery software uses real-time rates from carriers to display accurate delivery dates and multiple shipping options on your product, cart, and checkout pages.All pickup and delivery options displayed are tailored to the location of the individual customer to create a more personalized experience.See how Road iD was able to increase conversions up to 17% by displaying the most cost-effective shipping options to customers using Fenix.Solution #3 - Improve the post-purchase experience\\nYour connection with customers doesn’t just end once you get them through checkout.You must keep the experience enriched until the final delivery.That’s why it makes sense to optimize your post-purchase phase.For example, customers want the ability to track their orders, so make sure to offer order tracking and keep customers updated regularly about their packages until the delivery gets completed.With a smooth after-purchase experience, such customers are bound to return to your online store again the next time they need to shop or replenish their supplies.That’s how you earn customer loyalty and drive conversions.Fortunately, Fenix also provides branded order tracking services for retailers to make sure you’re creating an immersive end-to-end customer experience.Convert Higher by Utilizing Shipping Solutions Today \\nBeing open to alternative shipping solutions can be the game-changer that helps reduce shipping costs and improve overall customer service levels.At FenixCommerce, we are constantly creating software that helps retailers sell more and reduce abandoned carts arising from shipping and delivery challenges.If you’d like to have an eCommerce conversion expert at Fenix go over your entire shipping strategy and help set your logistics right, then reach out to us at once and schedule a free consultation.Author: Akhilesh
