Improve Construction Supply Logistics Efficiency\nRevolutionizing Construction Supply Logistics with Parcel Lockers\nCOMMERCIAL\nThe Future of Construction Supply Logistics: Integrating Automated Parcel Solutions\nWritten by: Power Digital\n5 Min Read\nPublished: March 30, 2024\nUpdated: April 17, 2024\nThe construction industry is poised for transformation, especially in building material supply logistics.Gordian’s most recent “Quarterly Construction Cost Insights Report for Q4 2023” update reveals a dichotomy of stabilization and persistent challenges that construction professionals must address to ensure timely construction project completion and cost-effective construction supplies delivery.1\nStabilizing Trends and Persistent Hurdles\nIn late 2023, the market breathed a sigh of relief as the prices of key building materials such as structural steel, framing lumber, and conduit decreased compared to the previous turbulent years.2\nAs Todd Burns, President, Project and Development Services, Americas, JLL, articulated: “With immense housing needs, return to office strengthening and federally backed infrastructure and manufacturing accelerating, the industry is poised for growth despite challenges.”3\nThese challenges include:\nLabor Shortages: Despite a stabilized market, the shortage of skilled laborers remains a significant roadblock, causing construction project delays and escalating labor costs.Interest Rate Challenges: Fluctuating interest rates add another layer of complexity, influencing the borrowing costs of construction projects.Red Sea Turmoil: Geopolitical unrest has disrupted maritime logistics.These events led to tragic losses and skyrocketing building material freight rates as companies rerouted around Africa to avoid conflict zones.Raw Material Shortages: The demand for quality materials is currently outpacing supply, creating a bottleneck that reverberates along the supply chain and exacerbates delays.Cargo Theft/Fraud – A new threat of cargo theft and fraud has emerged: “double brokering”.The Wall Street Journal reports that fraudsters, masquerading as legitimate carriers, are accepting payments to transport goods but then outsourcing the job and skimming off the top; alternatively, they are absconding with the merchandise to sell on their own accord.4 This fraudulent chain of events creates victims at each link: shippers lose their goods, brokers deal with betrayal, and the actual carriers end up uncompensated.Reports of freight fraud more than quadrupled in 2023 from the year before, according to data from CargoNet.Weather Challenges: Unprecedented droughts impeding major river transport corridors have also compounded delayed delivery schedules for construction supplies and already high logistics costs.How to Improve Construction Supply Logistics Efficiency\nGiven the challenges the construction supply industry is facing, efficiency in supply logistics and construction materials distribution is paramount.Here are the best practices to implement to help your business tackle inefficiencies and pave the path to progress:\nImprove Warehousing Systems\nWarehouse automation simplifies processes, saving time and reducing logistics errors.A good Warehouse Management System (WMS) allows for real-time inventory management and tracking, boosting warehouse efficiency, productivity, and accuracy.Enhance Customer Experience with Omnichannel Solutions\nThe construction supply industry must create a unified shopping experience to satisfy customer expectations.Omnichannel shopping means integrating online stores with physical retail experiences to ensure consistency across all platforms — from browsing and ordering construction materials to delivery and support.By giving customers an omnichannel experience, construction supply distributors provide convenience, speed, and a personalized touch.Embrace Digital Transformation\nThe power of digitization can’t be understated.It allows distributors to stay competitive and amplifies distribution efficiency.McKinsey & Company reports that COVID has accelerated digital transformation and that more than 50% of construction executives surveyed have already boosted their digital investment.5 By leveraging technological advancements, companies can meet the fast-paced demands of contractors and customers who crave real-time interactions and intelligent solutions.80% of B2B customers expect responses and interactions in real time.6\nLeverage Technology for Strategic Advantage\nTechnological advancements are transforming the distribution industry.The integration of omnichannel strategies is just the start.Construction supply distributors can significantly enhance their operations using analytics, supply planning, and logistical support powered by AI and machine learning.These technologies offer a previously unfathomable level of insight and efficiency to every supply chain step, from inventory management to customer engagement.Adapt to New Competitors\nA competitive shift in the landscape has also occurred.Established B2B distribution companies are diversifying their offerings while major B2C e-commerce giants are entering the B2B space, bringing the customer-centric focus that has dominated the B2C market.This intensifies the need for traditional construction supply distributors to innovate and adapt or risk losing ground.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5lifMrI7Wj2u5+z7BqD24oRJgc2K/3Y3Dwj7f1HNoDA="},"8978b7f3-6444-4c99-9885-35b99dd3e41a":{"id_":"8978b7f3-6444-4c99-9885-35b99dd3e41a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.parcelpending.com/en-ca/blog/construction-supply/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"d48ad2bb-12c8-46e4-8e9f-0f4f7b2a9ad6","metadata":{"url":"https://www.parcelpending.com/en-ca/blog/construction-supply/"},"hash":"hytPtBP2nZUWfjRzAdh71/tIsAFZilpjxMJhAiXPRmk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3e650a66-801a-4754-97bd-6fd906ffb1dc","metadata":{"url":"https://www.parcelpending.com/en-ca/blog/construction-supply/"},"hash":"5lifMrI7Wj2u5+z7BqD24oRJgc2K/3Y3Dwj7f1HNoDA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9a0ca9ff-49ea-45d4-820c-0a3821a6c50b","metadata":{},"hash":"k07E5PJ4fKKLxOv4xV31DKZFrcydveEPxZbcwHwWPsw="}},"text":"5

focus that has dominated the B2C market.This intensifies the need for traditional construction supply distributors to innovate and adapt or risk losing ground.Offer Value-Added Services as a Differentiator\nDistributors are encouraged to enhance their value proposition by offering added services that streamline ordering of quality materials and improve overall customer satisfaction.In a post-pandemic era, these value-added services have become niceties and necessities as consumer expectations carry over into B2B relationship demands.Revolutionizing Construction Supply Logistics with Parcel Lockers\nThe addition of parcel smart lockers presents an innovative solution that caters to the specific needs of the construction industry.Here’s how they are changing the game:\nOversized Lockers Work for Distributors\nWith solutions like oversized lockers from Parcel Pending by Quadient, even large and bulky supplies are easily handled.For instance, Ferguson, a leading distributor, recently installed Parcel Pending by Quadient smart lockers and oversized lockers to meet customer demand.With over 1,500 locations across the United States, Ferguson wanted to provide contractors with convenient, self-service transactions for large and bulky items at high-volume sites.Johnstone Supply, too, is incorporating smart lockers as part of their supply logistics strategy.The company has over $4.5 billion in annual sales generated by 465 franchise-operated locations across the US and Canada.Quadient’s indoor and outdoor parcel lockers allow Johnstone Supply’s customers to quickly retrieve products at their convenience, allowing them to spend more time at job sites.24/7/365 Accessibility\nTime is money, and construction professionals can’t afford delays.Standard electronic lockers and oversized lockers ensure that supplies are available anytime, maximizing efficiency and meeting tight project schedules.Adding parcel lockers creates a meaningful point of difference, adds a value-add component, and streamlines customer order fulfillment.Various indoor/outdoor smart parcel lockers meet fulfillment needs, including one-door and three-door oversized solutions.Parcel Pending by Quadient’s Buy Online, Pick-Up in Locker (BOPIL) technology can help construction supply distributors build a consistently superior omnichannel customer buying experience.In the face of ongoing uncertainty within the construction sector, a wave of measured optimism is rising.The industry is adopting forward-thinking supply chain strategies, harnessing insights from data analysis, employing data-centric technological solutions, and adding value-added services such as parcel lockers.Ready to grow your construction supply business?Contact one of our parcel management experts

France and Accelerates Roll-out of Open Network\nQuadient currently has more than 18,500 units in operation worldwide\nThursday, Jul 13th 2023 | All\nQuadient (Euronext Paris: QDT), a leader in helping businesses create meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels and a major global parcel locker operator, announced today it surpassed the 1,000 mark of automated parcel lockers in France. This success is the result of close collaboration with long-standing partners, including pick-up point operator Relais Colis and sports retailer Decathlon.\n“This achievement is a major milestone, thanks to the support from our strategic partners. As we continue to roll out a vast open and shared parcel locker network in France, we're actively preparing to welcome even more new partners,” explains Benoit Berson, Chief Solution Officer, Parcel Locker Solutions at Quadient. “We are observing a number of players deploying their own locker network, creating a multiplication of urban storage units to the detriment of public space. Besides being unsustainable in the long term, this solution is not thought through from a customer experience point of view. We have designed our network of universal lockers to fit into the urban environment, offering an open solution shared between the various players in transportation, local retail, and service companies. It is the only solution capable of combining the last mile and first mile in a way that is truly service-oriented, eco-friendly and rational over the long term.\"\nFor several years now, Quadient has been gradually extending its network of smart lockers across many countries, offering consumers a convenient, fast and secure solution for collecting their online orders. Available in Decathlon stores for their Click & Collect offer, but also in Carrefour retail stores, shopping malls, train stations and other public areas in France, Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers are an efficient solution for managing deliveries and collections 24/7. In the near future, they will also be available for returns and second-hand parcel depots.\nChristophe Cornilleau, General Manager of Relais Colis, said: \"We are delighted to celebrate this remarkable achievement with Quadient. A long-standing partner for parcel lockers, we are proud to have been by their side from the first installation to this thousandth unit, contributing to the development of their network in France, notably through our partnership with Carrefour. This important milestone demonstrates our shared commitment to offering consumers an ever more convenient and efficient parcel delivery experience. Aware of the climate challenges our industry faces, we will continue to strengthen our collaboration with Quadient, so that together we can meet the market's growing expectations in terms of customer satisfaction and responsible delivery.\"\nQuadient offers a complete portfolio of smart lockers designed to facilitate deliveries and returns, whether installed indoors or outdoors, and able to handle products of all types and sizes for different markets. Quadient currently has more than 18,500 units in operation worldwide.

Accelerates Roll-out of Open Network\nJuly 13, 2023 02:30 ET\n| Source: QUADIENT\nFollow\nShare\nQuadient (Euronext Paris: QDT), a leader in helping businesses create meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels and a major global parcel locker operator, announced today it surpassed the 1,000 mark of automated parcel lockers in France.This success is the result of close collaboration with long-standing partners, including pick-up point operator Relais Colis and sports retailer Decathlon.“This achievement is a major milestone, thanks to the support from our strategic partners.As we continue to roll out a vast open and shared parcel locker network in France, we're actively preparing to welcome even more new partners,” explains Benoit Berson, Chief Solution Officer, Parcel Locker Solutions at Quadient.“We are observing a number of players deploying their own locker network, creating a multiplication of urban storage units to the detriment of public space.Besides being unsustainable in the long term, this solution is not thought through from a customer experience point of view.We have designed our network of universal lockers to fit into the urban environment, offering an open solution shared between the various players in transportation, local retail, and service companies.It is the only solution capable of combining the last mile and first mile in a way that is truly service-oriented, eco-friendly and rational over the long term.\"For several years now, Quadient has been gradually extending its network of smart lockers across many countries, offering consumers a convenient, fast and secure solution for collecting their online orders.Available in Decathlon stores for their Click & Collect offer, but also in Carrefour retail stores, shopping malls, train stations and other public areas in France, Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers are an efficient solution for managing deliveries and collections 24/7.In the near future, they will also be available for returns and second-hand parcel depots.Christophe Cornilleau, General Manager of Relais Colis, said: \"We are delighted to celebrate this remarkable achievement with Quadient.A long-standing partner for parcel lockers, we are proud to have been by their side from the first installation to this thousandth unit, contributing to the development of their network in France, notably through our partnership with Carrefour.This important milestone demonstrates our shared commitment to offering consumers an ever more convenient and efficient parcel delivery experience.Aware of the climate challenges our industry faces, we will continue to strengthen our collaboration with Quadient, so that together we can meet the market's growing expectations in terms of customer satisfaction and responsible delivery.\"Quadient offers a complete portfolio of smart lockers designed to facilitate deliveries and returns, whether installed indoors or outdoors, and able to handle
