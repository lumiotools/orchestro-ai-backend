PROVEN STRATEGIES TO REDUCE SHIPPING COSTS WITHOUT SACRIFICING QUALITY\n21 June 2023\nShare\nShipping is a crucial part of any business, but it can also be one of the most expensive aspects.As a business owner in Malaysia, it is important to find ways to optimise this process by looking at how to reduce shipping costs while ensuring quality is not being sacrificed.However, with the increased competition in the e-commerce realm and the rise of online shopping in the country, this can be a challenging task.With the cost of shipping in Malaysia and around the world soaring, finding ways to bring down your shipping prices can be the difference between a successful business and one that struggles to stay afloat.In this blog post, we will explore a few strategies for achieving this goal in the Malaysian market.1.Compare shipping rates\nOne of the most effective ways to reduce shipping costs is to shop around and compare rates from different logistics service providers.By getting a few shipping quotes, you will be able to identify which ones are more economical for your business.This can be done by connecting directly with individual courier companies or even using comparison tools like Parcel Monkey – with access to international shipping rates within one space.It is important to consider not only the cost but also the quality of service and reliability of the logistics service provider.Some carriers may offer a lower rate but may have a longer delivery time or a higher rate of damaged or lost packages.Be sure to weigh all factors before making a decision.2.Consider alternative solutions\nAir shipping may be quicker, but it can also lead to higher costs.Splitting your packages into smaller parcels or opting for ground shipping can help bring down shipping fees.Another alternative is dropshipping, which is a method where businesses sell products without actually having them in stock.Instead, the supplier ships the product directly to the customer – eliminating the need for businesses to handle and ship products.You can also get creative with your shipping options.For example, offer free shipping only for customers who meet a minimum spend in your shop.This can also entice them to increase their purchases with your business.3.Choose the right packaging\nThe right type of packaging can not only protect your products during transportation but also minimises the size and weight of the package, which can lead to lower shipping costs.One approach is to use lean packaging – a method of designing packaging that uses minimal materials and maximises space.This can reduce the overall weight of the package.Additionally, using eco-friendly packaging materials can also attract customers who are conscious of the environment.4.Utilise technology\nToday, technology can streamline many shipping processes to save time and money.Shipping software – such as ShipStation or Shippo – can help to automate many tasks, such as printing shipping labels, tracking packages, and calculating postage fees.Some can even track inventory, help you find the cheapest way to insure your shipping orders, and give you a better understanding of your shipping needs.Find software which can be integrated with your selling platform, or work with a logistics service provider which can give you such visibility over your shipping activities.Many businesses partner with DHL Express because of its range of logistics solutions which can help them save on shipping costs, such as flexible delivery options, efficient routing, and real-time tracking.dhl express employee unloading a shipping container in malaysia\n5.Find reliable partners\nA reliable logistics service provider will ensure that your packages get delivered on time and in good condition.It will also know how to handle sensitive or fragile items, on top of providing accurate tracking information along the way.All these factors can help build trust with customers, offer an extra level of security and peace of mind, and help you avoid negative consequences such as delays, lost shipments, and customer complaints.DHL Express Malaysia, for example, provides an online shipping platform for businesses to create shipping labels, schedule pickups, track shipments, and access delivery status updates – all in one place.Additionally, with distribution centres strategically located in Malaysia and around the world, potential shipping challenges can also be mitigated.Tame out of control shipping costs\nShipping costs that are spiralling out of control can be daunting.However, by implementing these strategies, they can be managed effectively.By taking a strategic approach to shipping, businesses can not only reduce their expenses but also improve their overall efficiency and operations – and ultimately establish a successful business.Before you send a shipment from Malaysia to Singapore next time, consider the tips above to help you save on shipping costs without compromising on quality.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Bc4QyV4cW4tTPPKqLar9xiaTVqNaFwmICeCacOAXdSQ="},"e16a650f-8271-445d-8949-66788b5d622d":{"id_":"e16a650f-8271-445d-8949-66788b5d622d","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-my/logistics-advice/essential-guides/5-proven-strategies-to-reduce-shipping-costs-without-sacrificing"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"fe81a98c-9330-4a8f-bb43-5c7990319500","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-my/logistics-advice/essential-guides/5-proven-strategies-to-reduce-shipping-costs-without-sacrificing"},"hash":"+9VTu6ieS2upUh7dIBjPZbkiqy9ITVySUfYo9YWBURk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3f9814bd-ac1e-4f80-b8d7-69b9662ec88a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-my/logistics-advice/essential-guides/5-proven-strategies-to-reduce-shipping-costs-without-sacrificing"},"hash":"Bc4QyV4cW4tTPPKqLar9xiaTVqNaFwmICeCacOAXdSQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7ee8ade7-ac87-46fb-88d4-5c914e125cc4","metadata":{},"hash":"0Rb+7PAD5BlEb5yP0xSKzQKk8KzQQnp08wBA97227Iw="}},"text":"All

TO REDUCE SHIPPING COSTS: 5 TIPS FOR SMALL BUSINESS\n30 July 2024 4 Mins\nShare\nDue to the evolution of shopping habits and rise of online purchasing, we’re long past the carefree days of the local ‘mom and pop’ store that only caters to a small, face-to-face community of shoppers, and a notable lack of pressure in getting your product into the hands of your customer.Once a revolutionary concept, shipping goods is now so firmly established in our daily lives that it stands as basic expectation rather than novel appreciation.Though standard practice for any modern business, the logistical and financial demands presented by developing and maintaining a smoothly-run shipping system for your small business can nonetheless hit you as a difficult and stressful problem to overcome.With that in mind, let’s go through a number of quick-and-easy methods to lower shipping costs, so that both you and your customers don’t have to worry about the ‘A to B’ of it all.1.Audit Your Current Shipping Costs\nAsk yourself - what exactly is costing me money when it comes to shipping?Take some time to outline the areas in question - in all likelihood, it’s one or more of:\n●      Packaging\n●      Labour\n●      Couriers\n●      Import/Export Fees\nOnce you’ve correctly identified the area that’s causing you the most hassle, you can zero in and start to make alterations.2.Pack Light, Pack Smart\nEver bought something online and received a box that could have been two or three sizes smaller?You probably wondered what went into the thought process of the person who sent it out.Chances are, they didn’t think too hard about it.That’s not you, though.You’re going to cut costs, not corners, and it makes sense to start with the baseline of smartly and efficiently packing your goods.Scale your packaging to neatly and tightly fit your product - not only will this save on overall materials, but you’ll sidestep unnecessary dimensional weight charges in the process.Speaking of potential weight-based penalties, opt for lightweight packaging to avoid a harsh negotiation with the scales, or consider swapping out boxes altogether for padded envelopes should the situation safely allow for it - don’t compromise on protecting your product!It might not seem like a colossal saving on paper, but you’ll see the benefit of a structured, slimmed-down system the more you use it.Also, you’ll save more than money with these approaches - having a swift and regular routine should free up time to focus on other areas of your day-to-day duties.Tip: Learn about sustainable packaging solutions and why it’s important to your business\n3.Look For a Flat-Rate Option\nA straightforward, but possibly very beneficial one here.Shipping costs are naturally in a state of flux, which isn’t terribly helpful for long-term planning and delivery prospects.Consistency is key, as is a reputation for speed and reliability.Flat-rate shipping is a ‘what it says on the tin’ method that keeps your cost at a set rate, regardless of the size, weight, or shape or your packaged product.You may wish to negotiate the exact flat rate to your satisfaction, but once you have a clear picture of a regular calculated cost in front of you, it’s one less variable to worry about.4.Offer Customers a Free Shipping Threshold\nAnother common - and highly attractive - practice with online orders is the ability to receive free shipping.This isn’t offered by every business, and a heavy shipping cost can prove a deal-breaker once someone gets to the final checkout screen.If you can afford it, consider including the offer of free shipping should an order exceed a predetermined amount - enough to cover your costs, while keeping your customer happy, in turn keeping you in their mind for repeat business.However, if ‘free’ is a four-letter word that upsets you, introduce a tiered system that also includes express and leisurely delivery-time options, with the appropriate level of expense attached to each.5.Implement Technology Solutions\nThe future is now, and with a range of cutting-edge technology options out there to assist you, there’s no time like the present to see how your business can use these methods to your advantage.From integrated logistics tools to warehouse automation, to innovation when it comes to delivery and returns, to customer retention and upselling, to the use of AI-driven computer vision, smart and successful implementation of our available technology-focused solutions are as efficient as they are easy to adapt to.But don’t just take our word for it; there are numerous positive case studies you can read up on to get a more personalised perspective.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"x0C9vb2e09dIJkDyiJOvuwcEmH6wPgn4sDa7iZ3TS6Y="},"1dcab817-b405-418b-948b-ba4e3111b0a2":{"id_":"1dcab817-b405-418b-948b-ba4e3111b0a2","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-ie/logistics-advice/essential-guides/How-To-Reduce-Shipping-Costs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e5718a5d-685b-4263-a7b8-f8492bcce6cf","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-ie/logistics-advice/essential-guides/How-To-Reduce-Shipping-Costs"},"hash":"I45nZ8uqqTMzA96a+carsoUeSQEqfC39puOujq/ZfpM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b05ae98d-2925-48af-ad44-b0dd0659051a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-ie/logistics-advice/essential-guides/How-To-Reduce-Shipping-Costs"},"hash":"x0C9vb2e09dIJkDyiJOvuwcEmH6wPgn4sDa7iZ3TS6Y="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7356d54b-2c4d-4083-92e9-a91354ec06ae","metadata":{},"hash":"tUEgauYvWTsJAQi8XPH/ZrwJXs0c3ZUlbDiNYkH2cQ4="}},"text":"However,

available for other opportunities that could come around.Since freight charges for delivering goods in and out of Singapore are notoriously high, many business owners find themselves looking for ways to reduce their overall spending on shipping to save costs.So, how can you go about reducing overhead costs for your business?More specifically, how to reduce freight and delivery costs for shipping goods across the border?Learning how to reduce freight charges\nFreight charge, also commonly known as freight rate, is how much a sender pays a carrier company to transport goods to  a specific destination.In 2022, air freight charges are at an all-time high since Covid-19 and due to higher fuel costs from climbing oil price.The pandemic has affected global supply chains since 2020, and shipping prices reflect that.These high prices are estimated to remain at these levels until 2023.1.Reduce parcel size\nIt may not be common knowledge but weight is never the only  determining factor in calculating freight charges.Size of a parcel matters and the space it occupies will be calculated as volumetric weight.Typically parcel weight will be determined by either actual or volumetric weight whichever is higher.To understand how freight charges are calculated, we have to first understand that they are usually determined by several factors — size, weight, location of the destination, shipping method and quantity of goods.Since a parcel that is lighter or smaller would mean a lower shipping cost, you can look into reducing the dimensions of your product packaging to make it as light and small as possible.Eliminate unnecessary design that increases the thickness of the packaging, or cut down on unwanted frills.If you sell small, non-fragile products like clothing, shipping orders in a mailer envelope or poly mailer can be far more cost-effective than using boxes.This will reduce the dimensions of your package significantly, and uses less packing supplies like tape and bubble wrap, further reducing shipping-related costs.2.Change your shipping method\nWhile it might have been a cheaper option to ship via ocean before COVID-19, air freight options  might save you more money in the long run due to possible delays in sea shipping.Lesser delays in shipping would also mean a faster delivery time for your customers, which might even help increase retention rates and revenue for your business in the near future.3.Ship during off-peak periods\nWith an increase in orders during the holidays, it’s no surprise that shipping companies increase their prices during these high-volume periods.To avoid inflated freight charges during the peak periods, consider shipping a day or two before.Of course, this method of reducing freight charges should only be used if you are shipping non-consumable products.Save on freight costs by shipping with DHL Express today \nIf you are looking for the ideal shipping solution for your business, why not give DHL Express a

GUIDE ON HOW TO REDUCE SHIPPING COSTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES\nJanuary 31, 2024 4 Mins Read\nShare\nUndoubtedly, e-commerce has been a crucial lifeline for many individuals and businesses during the pandemic.Even as we slowly emerge from the lockdowns and restrictions, the shift to digital commerce has remained strong across multiple countries, economies and industries — and Cambodia is no different.As a matter of fact, according to Khmer Times, Cambodia's market value of e-commerce increased by 19% from 2020 to 2021.In addition, the e-commerce sector is expected to expand even further, and the market volume could possibly hit over 2 billion by 2027.Accrediting it to the advent of new technologies, increasing digitisation, or rising income levels, Cambodia's e-commerce sector is making steady progress towards sustainable growth.However, as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Cambodia leverage online sales as a means of growth and sustainability, there remains a challenge.This is the challenge of navigating the cost of shipping.So, what strategies can SMEs and online businesses adopt to reduce shipping expenses and enhance their profit margins?1.Work with a trusted shipping partner\nPartnering with the right shipping company can help small and medium-sized businesses reduce shipping costs.But how do you go about getting discounted and the cheapest shipping rates if you are not an industry giant?For one, it is important to research and compare the prices and services of various shipping companies to better understand their offerings.Whether you leverage an online container shipping costs calculator or personally request quotes, getting a range of prices can aid the decision of choosing the option that is the best value for your money.Moreover, having all this disposable information means that you can negotiate for lower rates.You can also provide your sales projections to the shipping partner to get more favourable rates, especially if you expect an increase in demand due to seasonality or growth.However, it is important not to go for the cheapest option that comes your way.The last thing any small business would want is for their customers to receive their orders late, damaged, or not at all.Look for a shipping provider with a reliable track record and provides good customer service.DHL Express offers not only comprehensive yet flexible shipping solutions that can be tailored to fit your specific needs but also provides reliable and fast shipping services to several countries and territories worldwide.Working with a trusted shipping partner like us can also help you navigate the complexities of customs clearance, duties, and taxes.2.Streamline your shipping process\nReducing shipping costs also involves streamlining your shipping processes.For example, using a shipping platform that integrates with your e-commerce infrastructure can help you manage your shipping more efficiently and improve complex international logistics operations.This reduces manual errors and processing times.You can also consider using a fulfilment centre that handles your shipping and warehousing needs.Easily save on shipping costs by consolidating your shipments and reducing shipping distances.3.Leverage bulk shipping to lower costs\nIf you run a B2B e-commerce business that tends to ship large orders to business or wholesale customers, bulk shipping can be a valuable strategy to save on shipping expenses.Shipping in larger quantities provides an opportunity to take advantage of discounted rates offered by shipping carriers.In addition, packing your products tightly together helps reduce the space they occupy in the truck or air cargo container, which means you'll pay less for transportation.However, ensuring that products are packed securely is important to avoid damage during transit.4.Optimise your packaging\nFollowing the above, one of the most significant factors you can control to reduce shipping costs and make it more affordable for you and your customers is your packaging.From cutting down on the weight of your packaging to using packages given by your carriers, you could save a considerable amount of money.To achieve this, investing in a postage scale is advisable if you plan to print shipping labels yourself.Accurate package weight is essential to avoid higher shipping charges, especially if you're not using flat-rate shipping.This allows you to consciously reduce your parcels' overall volumetric weight to significantly lower shipment costs as a result.This can be achieved by using boxes that fit the size of your products as closely as possible or by packing small items into more compact boxes or lightweight poly mailers.Although this may require you to stock up on various packaging materials, it can make a long-term difference in reducing your business costs.Proper packaging also ensures that your shipments reach your customers safely and securely, saving you from potential expenses such as refunds and compensation for damaged goods.Packaging costs can also add up, especially if you are using premium packaging materials or shipping large items.Consider using more economical packaging materials, such as recycled boxes.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"JWF+4Rbg42xxyCExHuGPz0G4Vvgp/De05knYNqYydvU="},"dd6737b0-7cf9-4b0c-b1ba-80db4a30c874":{"id_":"dd6737b0-7cf9-4b0c-b1ba-80db4a30c874","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-kh/small-business-advice/starting-a-business/how-to-reduce-shipping-costs-for-small-businesses"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"7d173e7b-5af4-4b0f-b54c-1f5c93d4846e","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-kh/small-business-advice/starting-a-business/how-to-reduce-shipping-costs-for-small-businesses"},"hash":"jz3xc7o5yvJvlVlb5pbc4D9VDMYt2tt1c5IHaftwD98="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e5d1f63a-f635-4926-9873-54713df5f77a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-kh/small-business-advice/starting-a-business/how-to-reduce-shipping-costs-for-small-businesses"},"hash":"JWF+4Rbg42xxyCExHuGPz0G4Vvgp/De05knYNqYydvU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7aa92465-0e46-4103-8b19-764b0800b122","metadata":{},"hash":"Ixeepn+OE9Wd/5u5tYJogzpo2GNxhQUjsECMQz6GHzg="}},"text":"To

WAYS SMALL BUSINESSES IN INDIA CAN REDUCE SHIPPING COSTS\n3 August 2023 4 Mins Read\nShare\nThe e-commerce market in India is projected to grow at a neck-breaking rate, from US$22 billion in 2018 to an estimated US$350 billion by 2020, reports Statista.Much of this growth can be attributed to digitalisation over the decades, as well as an increasing internet user base as the country urbanises.On top of this, India’s exports, according to the India Briefing, peaked at a value of US$417.81 billion during the financial year from 2021 to 2022.This indicates that global shipping is an increasingly important aspect for successful businesses in India.Certainly, e-commerce offers a bundle of opportunities, but when discussing these from a shipper’s perspective, SMEs may find themselves facing increasing expenses when exporting products overseas.So, how can online businesses reduce their shipping costs in ways that level up their profit margins?1.Ensure proper packaging to reduce the weight and dimensions of your shipments\nMost carriers generate a quote for shipments based on their weight and dimensions.Minimising these can help you reduce shipping costs.Pack smaller shipments in compact, lightweight boxes so you can shave off the unnecessary volume.You can also invest in a postage scale to calculate your costs more accurately, so you can optimise the allocation of finances more effectively.That’s not to say that you cannot explore unique packaging ideas to stand out from the crowd.Rather, it’ll be helpful to consider the weight and size of these packages so that you can benefit both from its cost-efficiency and brand appeal \n2.Purchase labels & packing materials in bulk\nWhen buying packaging supplies for your shipments, purchase them in bulk to save more.For certain packaging items, numerous shipping providers may offer discounted boxes and envelopes to businesses, when they choose to pay these costs upfront.You may also buy shipping labels in advance and in bulk from your carrier at a flat rate and use them to label your packages for the next few months or the year.For small businesses exporting products with the same or similar weight and dimensions, this tactic works brilliantly.This way, you eventually pay less than what you’d need to fork out if you purchased labels and packing materials every month.3.Include shipping fees upfront\nTo stay competitive, you may be tempted to offer free shipping to your customers.But this approach may not be financially prudent, especially if you’re just starting out.In this case, state your shipping charges (i.e. together with the product) so that customers know the total cost from the start.Such transparency helps manage customer expectations and builds their trust.4.Use integrated e-commerce platforms\nRunning an online store on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, eBay, or Shopify is only part of the deal.Integrating them with your logistics provider can help you streamline operations with intuitive shipping solutions and gain access to shipping discounts, as you would with our DHL Express Commerce integration feature.You’ll be able to save money on shipping while ensuring a seamless shopping experience for your customers.5.Choose a trusted logistics partner\nThe easiest way to reduce shipping costs is by choosing a trusted logistics partner that offers favourable rates and solutions.You’re advised to negotiate with several carriers and compare their quotations to find the one most suitable for you.The ideal carrier provides the best value for money based on the volume and size of your shipments.At the same time, you’d want to work with a shipping company that not only provides cost-effective rates but is also dependable and professional in their service.DHL

TO REDUCE SHIPPING COSTS: E-COMMERCE SHIPPING SOLUTIONS FOR SMES\n22 June 2023 7 Mins Read\nShare\nE-commerce continues its meteoric rise as the number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore turning to online sales is growing.Now more than ever, platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce are leveraged to sell anything from clothes and jewellery to dog food.While online retailing offers a myriad of opportunities, the cost of shipping remains one of the biggest expenses for small businesses.So, how can SMEs and online businesses save on or reduce international shipping costs and boost profit margins?Overview of the high shipping costs faced by SMEs\nThe e-commerce sector in Singapore is growing rapidly, with brands such as Taobao and Alibaba establishing a strong presence in the market.Local SMEs are also playing a vital role in its expansion.However, SMEs in the e-commerce sector are facing the challenge of high shipping costs, which is a significant burden on their resources.These are caused by several factors, including the distance between the seller and the buyer, the size and weight of products, the prices of fuels and the delivery timeframe.High shipping costs affect their competitiveness and their ability to remain profitable, ultimately hindering their growth potential in the e-commerce market.Therefore, SMEs require innovative and effective solutions on how to reduce their cost of shipping to enhance their competitiveness in the e-commerce industry in Singapore.Factors affecting the SME shipping costs\nWhen it comes to shipping costs for SMEs in the e-commerce sector in Singapore, there are several components to consider.1.Delivery charges\nDelivery charges are a significant factor in determining shipping costs for SMEs in the e-commerce sector.These charges are typically determined by the shipping carrier and are based on factors such as the weight, size, and distance of the package being shipped.Depending on the shipping carrier, delivery charges may also vary depending on the speed of delivery required.2.Packaging costs\nPackaging costs are another component that contributes to overall shipping costs for SMEs in the e-commerce sector.Effective packaging is critical to ensure that products arrive at their destination undamaged, but it can also add to shipping costs.Businesses must consider the cost of materials and labour required to package their products effectively.To learn more about how to save costs while packing, read DHL Express’ guide on how to order packing supplies.3.Fuel surcharges\nFuel surcharges are an additional factor that can significantly impact shipping costs for SMEs in the e-commerce sector.As fuel prices rise, shipping carriers may add fuel surcharges to their delivery fees to offset these increased costs.4.Insurance fees\nInsurance fees can also contribute to overall shipping costs for SMEs in the e-commerce sector.These fees are charged by the shipping carrier to provide coverage in the event that a package is lost, stolen, or damaged during transit.While insurance fees can add to shipping costs, they can also provide peace of mind to businesses that are shipping valuable products.How to Save on Shipping\nWhen SMEs in the e-commerce sector in Singapore understand the components that contribute to their shipping costs, they can make more informed decisions to help cut down on their expenses.By analysing the various components, businesses can identify how they may be able to reduce international shipping costs.Here are some tips SMEs can use to cut down on their cost of shipping.1.Choose a trusted shipping partner \nYou don’t have to be an industry giant to get discounted shipping rates.While higher shipment volumes typically get discounts, even a small business can benefit by comparing prices for various e-commerce delivery solutions and negotiating lower rates.Make sure to request for a selection of quotes from numerous e-commerce shipping companies to compare prices.It is always best to research providers thoroughly so as to assess whether they offer the best value for your money.Use each carrier’s quote as a bargaining chip in negotiating for more favourable rates.Also, you can share your sales projections if you expect demand to increase in the coming months due to seasonality or growth.GET 60% OFF* ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SHIPPING\nOPEN A BUSINESS ACCOUNT\n2.Consider using an integrated e-commerce platform \nOver 60% of Singapore’s online retailers are on the Shopify platform, with the rest using numerous other sites like WooCommerce.If you are running an online store using Shopify, you might just be able to access hassle-free international shipping and shipping discounts within the platform using the DHL Express Commerce integration directly.DHL partnered with Shopify to enable Singapore-based online retailers to easily ship their products worldwide through a simple, seamless plugin on their shipping app.By leveraging this function, you can access flexible express shipping services to 220 countries and territories at negotiated rates.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tMSK/JiF658TaLu7QKJSLBl2Tquz3gaTkWIGIPLK2tw="},"d97da1b9-853f-43af-9fe7-679d00911ab5":{"id_":"d97da1b9-853f-43af-9fe7-679d00911ab5","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-sg/e-commerce-advice/e-commerce-best-practice/How-to-Cut-Down-on-Shipping-Costs-E-Commerce-Shipping-Solutions-for-SMEs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"8387dbe0-8814-4c47-a3e9-4f20a85d68e6","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-sg/e-commerce-advice/e-commerce-best-practice/How-to-Cut-Down-on-Shipping-Costs-E-Commerce-Shipping-Solutions-for-SMEs"},"hash":"DBKI52+B4oqOPwSvyvbvghbSvDMncrLlb3lYPCa2xII="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"83155412-24be-4dd3-ac84-50d88725088c","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-sg/e-commerce-advice/e-commerce-best-practice/How-to-Cut-Down-on-Shipping-Costs-E-Commerce-Shipping-Solutions-for-SMEs"},"hash":"tMSK/JiF658TaLu7QKJSLBl2Tquz3gaTkWIGIPLK2tw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a1073bcb-6ab5-4dcf-8bd8-2ce5d8ff4b65","metadata":{},"hash":"wHvdzFcLKGbHu5w6mofu+d06hVLQaUtSN+cxDZNyXio="}},"text":"It

Singapore retailers to ship their products internationally.3.Include shipping costs upfront\nWhile still trying to stay competitive, offering free shipping might not be financially feasible.Stating the product’s shipping cost upfront will manage your customer’s expectations and ensure transparency in delivery charges.4.Pre-pay shipping costs\nMore often than not, pre-paying ahead of time can get you discounts on shipping costs.Even if it's a small percentage, it can lead to significant savings for small businesses in the long run.Simply purchase shipping labels upfront and use them on packages only when you’re ready to ship.This tactic works best when you ship products consistently with the same weight and dimensions, or have this information before purchasing the labels.5.Package your products appropriately \nIf you intend to purchase and print labels by yourself, invest in a postage scale to give you a better idea of the package weight, allowing you to get a more accurate cost.Most carriers charge based on either the volumetric (dimensional) weight or actual weight whichever is greater.This means reducing any unnecessary volume of the package can help save on excessive shipping costs.Small items can be packaged in more compact boxes or lightweight poly mailers.If you don't have boxes or are unable to find suitable materials, fret not, as DHL Express provides a range of external packaging supplies to meet your needs.Another way to streamline shipping operations is by developing clear and consistent packaging guidelines.This can help reduce packaging costs by ensuring that products are packaged in a way that minimises weight and size while still protecting the items during shipping.Additionally, using standardised packaging materials can help simplify the process and reduce the cost of materials.Unsure what’s the best way to package your products?Check out our handy shipment packing guides for clothes, shoes, cosmetics, and fragile items, to get started.Alternatively, speak to our specialist today.6.Streamlining shipping operations\nStreamlining shipping operations is a crucial step for SMEs in the e-commerce sector in Singapore looking to cut down on shipping costs.By optimising shipping processes, businesses can achieve greater efficiency and cost savings, which can ultimately lead to improved profitability.One way to streamline shipping operations is by implementing automation technology, such as automated labelling software.This technology can help reduce errors and speed up processing times, allowing businesses to handle a higher volume of shipments with fewer resources.Consolidating shipments is an effective way to streamline shipping operations too.By combining multiple orders into one shipment, small businesses in Singapore can save time, reduce shipping costs for customers, and simplify logistics.Taobao's consolidated shipping service is a great example of how this process can work.With Taobao's service, customers can purchase items from multiple sellers and have them shipped together, saving both time and money.By consolidating shipments, Taobao can optimise its shipping routes, reduce the number of packages that need to be handled, and provide customers with a more streamlined shipping experience.Overall, consolidating shipments can be a highly effective way to improve the efficiency of shipping operations, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.Finally, consider implementing a Delivery Duty Paid (DDP) model, where the business is responsible for fees and risks of shipping until they are sent to an agreed location by the business and buyer.Read our guide to learn more about what DDP shipping is and when you should use it.By optimising processes and leveraging technology, businesses can not only reduce their shipping costs but also improve their competitiveness and growth potential in the market.7.Sign up for corporate accounts with discounted business rates\nSigning up for a corporate account with a shipping carrier such as DHL Express Singapore can offer significant cost savings, especially for small and medium businesses in the e-commerce sector.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"oMY7flbj0CylQPshBvx24KxnOVRY6Gy+zRNQKXIOLXA="},"a1073bcb-6ab5-4dcf-8bd8-2ce5d8ff4b65":{"id_":"a1073bcb-6ab5-4dcf-8bd8-2ce5d8ff4b65","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-sg/e-commerce-advice/e-commerce-best-practice/How-to-Cut-Down-on-Shipping-Costs-E-Commerce-Shipping-Solutions-for-SMEs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"8387dbe0-8814-4c47-a3e9-4f20a85d68e6","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-sg/e-commerce-advice/e-commerce-best-practice/How-to-Cut-Down-on-Shipping-Costs-E-Commerce-Shipping-Solutions-for-SMEs"},"hash":"DBKI52+B4oqOPwSvyvbvghbSvDMncrLlb3lYPCa2xII="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d97da1b9-853f-43af-9fe7-679d00911ab5","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-sg/e-commerce-advice/e-commerce-best-practice/How-to-Cut-Down-on-Shipping-Costs-E-Commerce-Shipping-Solutions-for-SMEs"},"hash":"3+sbxGPixl8+siG7c69xiNcasInh9ie5xe4TTfp6Rdc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"42c8672e-d4a5-4894-a6d7-0f208f1f2821","metadata":{},"hash":"IOs9rTCsinIzgE+Z/+QzcxsqJVEqRhHvddG9Lal+62o="}},"text":"By

ID\n#eCommerceAdvice\nHOW TO REDUCE SHIPPING RATES FOR SMES\nFebruary 18, 2024 4 Mins Read\nShare\nAccording to Baymard Institute, 48% of shoppers attribute abandoning their carts to the high costs of shipping.Although it can be tempting to offer the lowest shipping rates to your customers, doing so may have a negative impact on your profit margins.Hence, it is crucial for small businesses to provide low-cost shipping to benefit their company and customers.If you are in the business for the long term, you need strategies that will ensure you get competitive shipping rates consistently.Read on to learn how you can provide cost-effective shipping options for your small business.Why is shipping expensive?Growing consumer trend is the main cause of high shipping fees.The global e-commerce market has grown by 44% from 2019 to 2020, 32-36% faster than other high-growth markets.This growth has put pressure on the entire supply chain.When resources are limited, it creates a ripple effect on price changes.Manufacturers increase the average wholesale price; wholesalers increase their prices to distributors and distributors will increase costs to shipping companies.Other factors that affect the increase in shipping costs include:\nHigh transportation costs: Besides gas and fuel prices, the cost of shipping containers contributes to the increase in shipping costs.According to IMF, the cost of shipping containers has increased by seven-fold since March 2020.Port congestion: With more cargo ships waiting to unload their goods, shipping carriers have to load fewer containers onto their ships.This means that more trips are needed, which causes an increase in transportation costs.Increase in consumer demand: As more consumers turn to e-commerce shopping, companies need to have a strong outbound process.The more products needed to be shipped, the higher the costs.Tips to reduce shipping costs\nShipping cost is one of the factors that affect customers’ buying decisions.With customers’ expectations rising due to more e-commerce platforms offering free shipping, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have to find solutions that keep shipping costs low while maintaining healthy profit margins.Here are some strategies for cutting down shipping costs.1.Ship with a trusted logistics partner \nOne of the ways small businesses can reduce their shipping costs would be price comparison.You can request quotes from multiple shipping companies to compare prices.Make sure to conduct adequate research so as to assess whether you are getting the rate that has the best value.Another way is by negotiating.You can use the quotes offered by these shipping companies and negotiate a more favourable rate.Sharing your business’ sales projections can be helpful if you are expecting an increase in demand in the near future.A trusted logistics partner can help to minimise potential delivery problems such as damaged or lost goods.You can also avoid situations where you would need to expend resources on service recovery by having your goods reach your customers on time and in the right conditions.2.Get shipping quotes first\nShipping quotes are estimated total costs based on shipment details.Logistics providers such as DHL Express have a quote calculating tool on their website to estimate shipping costs based on input details.The best thing about online quotes is that they are instantaneous.This allows you to have an instant quote so that you can decide on the go.For customised shipping, you can always contact customer support for help.This is an effective way to reduce average shipping costs for a small business, as you can always go for the delivery option with the lowest prices.3.Package items effectively\nPackaging is an important component of the shipping process that business cannot afford to overlook.Ensure that the packaging you’re selecting is not adding on to the overall costs of shipping.As the size of packages is used to determine the overall shipping cost, focus on packaging your items effectively.Keep the total volume of the package trimmed down to only what’s necessary to avoid extra shipping costs.Your packaging should also be as light as possible since the weight of the parcels affects shipping costs.If you are unsure what type of packaging to use, you can consult your logistics company for help.DHL Express offers optional shipment preparation services that help you to manage the entire process.4.Purchase shipping insurance\nShipping insurance helps to cover financial losses against any shipping problems, such as damaged or lost packages.In the event this happens, not only will your customer feel assured that they will be compensated for any loss, you will be reimbursed for the item and shipping costs.This allows you to ultimately eliminate any extra costs associated with shipping damages or delays.Choose DHL as your shipping partner \nWith an extensive network covering 220 countries, DHL Express offers global logistics for SMEs in Indonesia.We provide small businesses with competitive international shipping rates, timely delivery options, and comprehensive support throughout the shipping process.Open a DHL Express account today and start reducing your shipping costs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qZYeufAEbMzpVL3wlEA3x6GK9x6CKkmqvFjsdXHBv/0="},"0fd4eaf1-b918-4717-b1e6-9328dc182bb5":{"id_":"0fd4eaf1-b918-4717-b1e6-9328dc182bb5","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-id/e-commerce-advice/e-commerce-best-practice/how-to-reduce-shipping-rates-for-smes"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"74aef824-3b9d-477f-89e3-883b26b5d217","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-id/e-commerce-advice/e-commerce-best-practice/how-to-reduce-shipping-rates-for-smes"},"hash":"VT3vEs0e+E8nobyV651BXuWYD/eO4Oi7Q/R82wPbomk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4a2c2f24-899a-4e82-ad6d-fa39e7c54088","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-id/e-commerce-advice/e-commerce-best-practice/how-to-reduce-shipping-rates-for-smes"},"hash":"qZYeufAEbMzpVL3wlEA3x6GK9x6CKkmqvFjsdXHBv/0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"caee7c83-87b8-4fae-b980-acab4f612c20","metadata":{},"hash":"7RoFodJ5oVrgjFMpQMiEE98TEZqc4V6dsJDOVVxGOIk="}},"text":"Your

TH\n#LogisticsAdvice\nHOW SMES CAN REDUCE SHIPPING COSTS\nFebruary 15, 2024 2 Mins Read\nShare\nRegardless of your industry, be it fashion e-commerce or a local herb retailer, packaging is always an important consideration when trying to cut shipping costs.As shipping fees are often determined by the weight and size of the shipment, it is ideal for SMEs to optimise the size of their packaging and focus on packing items securely without wasting space or money.Investing in good packaging supplies can also help SMEs save money on shipping costs in the long run.By procuring packaging supplies in bulk and having a variety of size options readily available, SMEs can reduce the overall cost of shipping, thereby saving money on packaging materials.Furthermore, using high-quality packaging materials can prevent product damage during transit, which in turn prevents the wastage of resources on returns and replacements.To aid SMEs in Thailand, DHL Express offers a variety of durable and environmentally friendly packaging options that provide optimal protection for your products during transit.Contact us today to learn more about our packaging solutions.3.Negotiate rates with your shipping carrier\nNegotiating rates with your shipping carrier is another great way to reduce international and local shipping costs.If your business ships a significant volume of products, it's worth contacting your carrier to get a better rate.Many logistics companies, including DHL Express Thailand, offer volume discounts to high-volume shippers.These discounts can be significant and help your SME save a considerable amount on shipping fees, so you have more to spend on other aspects of your business.To negotiate a better rate with your shipping carrier, it's crucial to have a good understanding of your shipping volume and requirements.Make a strong case for a better rate by presenting data on how many packages you ship in Thailand and overseas, how frequently you send them, and your average package weight and size.Finally, it's worth noting that negotiating rates with your shipping carrier isn't a one-time event.As your small business grows or your e-commerce site receives more attention causing your shipping volume to increase, you should continue to monitor your shipping costs.With these new statistics, negotiate with your carrier to ensure you get the cheapest and best deal possible.Ship with ease when you work with DHL Express Thailand\nWhether you are a small business owner or a budding e-commerce entrepreneur, shipping fees can be a significant challenge for SMEs, but there are ways to reduce them.Following the above tips, SMEs can save money on shipping costs and focus on growing their companies.Sign up for a business account with DHL Express Thailand

COST CHARGES – HOW TO CUT DOWN ON SHIPPING COSTS?12 May 2022 3 Mins Read\nShare\nIf you're selling products online to overseas markets, you definitely have to budget for the shipping rates involved to send your goods.Like all other overhead costs, the best way to maximize your net profits is to do whatever possible to minimize what you’re spending on shipping.However, do be careful in how you cut down these costs as you don’t want your customers’ experience with your online shop to suffer as a result.So what are some of the best ways to reduce freight costs that won’t affect returning customer rates?5 freight cost reduction ideas to boost profit margins\nIf you’d like to get the best bang for your buck and maximize your profit margins, consider the following five ways to help reduce freight costs.1.Revise your packaging methods\nShipping costs are calculated by how far away the delivery destination is as well as the weight and dimensions of the package itself.While you can’t really do much about the delivery destination, you can make changes to the package’s weight and size.There are a few options to help effectively reduce both the weight and dimensions:\nCustom-designed packaging: For any products that are hot sellers, it may well be worth getting customized packaging made up for them.While this can cost a bit upfront, you may find it pays for itself quite quickly.Lightweight packaging alternatives: Opting for a combination of corrugated boxes and lighter packing materials like bubble wrap or air pillows will most definitely reduce overall weight.Remember that any minor reduction in weight and size adds up a lot over time, which can greatly reduce your shipping costs.2.Take out insurance\nWhen you’re selling higher-value items, taking out shipping insurance is an absolute must as this will cover you against any unexpected loss, theft, or damage before your package reaches its destination.You’re not only reimbursed for the item and shipping charges, but your otherwise-affected customer’s experience will also still remain a positive one.According to Project 44’s research, it states that 84% of shoppers wouldn’t return to shop after just one negative experience, you can understand the importance of ensuring a fantastic purchasing journey for every customer.3.Search for discount supplies \nIt might sound a little obvious, but there are often sales on packaging supplies, so be sure to keep an eye out for the latest discounts on Amazon, eBay, and other outlets to help reduce shipping costs.4.Pre-pay for low cost shipping\nIf you buy several pre-paid shipping labels at the same time, the freight rates you pay are reduced.This is ideal in situations where you know that weights and dimensions being sent out from your business are identical.For example, you’re an e-commerce business selling high volume products such as soap and shampoo.5.Find a top-quality delivery partner\nWhen you put your faith into a less-than-reliable shipping service, you will most likely encounter problems such as constant mis-delivering, damaged, or even lost packages.Going with a quality delivery partner means your freight charges will reduce because the items you’re shipping will actually arrive at their destination on time and in one piece.At DHL Express, we offer different fast delivery services — Same Day, Time-Sensitive and Day-Sensitive – to further expand your customers choices so they can feel in control.Will freight shipping costs eventually go down?Unfortunately, it’s impossible to predict where freight rates will be, even six months from now.But there are most certainly reliable, low cost shipping companies for businesses available that work hard to keep rates as constant as possible.Create

rise to new opportunities in the e-commerce sphere.With more people staying at home out of necessity or safety, it’s no surprise that online shopping has boomed as businesses increasingly went digital.Let the numbers do the talking — according to Statista, the global value of e-commerce sales hit US$5.8 trillion in 2023, with revenues projected to reach US$8 trillion in 2027.In Hong Kong, as reported by the SCMP, e-commerce sales are expected to rise from US$22.9 billion in 2021 to US$29.4 billion in 2024.A growing number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Hong Kong have embraced digitalisation and online retailing platforms, with more than half reporting an increase in online sales.As more retailers enter the playing field, the flourishing e-commerce industry is becoming more saturated than ever.Amidst a myriad of challenges, shipping costs remain one of the biggest expenses for SMEs.How can small businesses save money on shipping to raise profit margins and stay competitive?1.Opt for a trusted shipping partner\nChoosing a reliable shipping partner can go a long way in reducing shipping costs for small businesses.Experienced logistics providers like DHL Express often have comprehensive yet flexible shipping solutions tailored to individual business needs.While it is generally easier to get discounted shipping rates with larger shipment volumes, small businesses can benefit by comparing prices from numerous e-commerce shipping providers.By using each carrier’s quote as a bargaining chip, you will have more leverage to negotiate for cheaper shipping rates.You can also consider sharing your sales projections with carriers to get the best shipping rates, especially if you are expecting higher sales due to seasonality or growth.2.Get preferred shipping rates \nIf you’ve settled on one particular shipping partner, you might be able to save money on frequent shipping.For instance, opening a DHL Express account can get you various benefits, including preferential rates on international shipping and billing options.3.Weigh packages and pack them appropriately\nOptimal packaging is essential for small businesses to save money on shipping.If you are planning to print shipping labels by yourself, it’s best to invest in a postage scale.Larger and heavier packages lead to higher shipping charges.Hence, if you’re not paying for flat-rate shipping, knowing the accurate package weight can help to reduce shipping costs significantly.Another tactic to save on shipping is to reduce package dimensions by using boxes that fit the size of products as closely as possible.Doing so reduces the overall volumetric weight of your parcels, which lowers shipment costs.Consider packing small items into more compact boxes or lightweight poly mailers.Even if that means stocking up on a range of packaging materials, it can make a long-term difference in cutting business costs.An added benefit of proper packaging is the assurance that shipments will reach your customers safe and sound — saving you the potential expense of refunds and compensation for damaged goods.Not sure what is the best way to pack your products?Check out our
