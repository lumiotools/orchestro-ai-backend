This process should be flexible enough to adapt to the specific requirements of various jobs, be it forwarding, customs, or any other type.\\nMoreover, it is crucial that this process produces high-quality data, which can be relied upon in downstream processes. Whether dealing with extensive Payables, analyzing weekly job profits, or creating a comprehensive and compliant invoice, the generated data holds paramount importance.\\nThis is where software solutions like CargoWise play a pivotal role. With robust accounting and financial management capabilities deeply integrated into a unified logistics execution platform, CargoWise assists global logistics companies in streamlining financial operations while ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and standards.\\nAs a product-led business, our focus and investment in product development and innovation are critical. That's why we continuously enhance global accounting features that boost efficiency and provide greater visibility and control over your expenditure and margins.\\nFrom enhanced FX batch payment functionality to improved electronic invoicing in China and updated electronic reporting in Turkey, here are five of the latest accounting features in CargoWise.\\nBulk FX transactions in multiple currencies – GLOBAL\\nIn the dynamic world of international trade, overcoming the limitations of funding foreign currency deals with local currency is crucial. Our solution? Choose the currency that aligns best with your financial goals.\\nThis powerful new feature allows you to either default to your local currency or opt for a specific currency for funding, ensuring a tailored and efficient transaction process that suits your unique needs.\\nOur native integration with Foreign Exchange specialists, OFX, takes the hassle out of the process by offering a cross rate between your chosen funding currency and the payment currency. This eliminates the need to confine funding your FX deals with local currency, providing you with extra flexibility in the management of your international transactions.\\nBut that's not all. You can now elevate your foreign exchange processing capabilities with our enhanced batch payment functionality.\\nIn a single payment batch, you can get quotes, book FX deals, and send payments for multiple currencies, funded with your currency of choice. Batch payments are your ticket to a faster, more accurate, and cost-effective payment experience.\\nEnhanced electronic invoicing compliance – CHINA\\nIn China, many of our customers rely on a form of electronic invoicing known as fully digitalized e-fapiao. This differs from both VAT e-fapiao and traditional paper fapiao but holds the same legal standing.\\nThe pilot program for fully digitalized e-fapiao commenced on December 1, 2021, with selected taxpayers in Shanghai, Guangdong, and Inner Mongolia (Hohhot) adopting these digital invoices. In 2022 and 2023, more taxpayers joined the program, with the goal of making fully digitalized e-fapiao available nationwide by 2025.\\nCurrently, in CargoWise, eligible invoices are sent to RongJin’s Tax Easy portal and set to 'Pending' status. With our latest update, you now have the option to issue the fully digitalized e-fapiao immediately upon posting Receivable Invoices in CargoWise.\\nThis is ideal for issuing one fapiao per invoice without additional review in the Tax Easy portal. It's hassle-free – no extra steps are required after posting the Receivable Invoices, and you can easily check the fapiao status and obtain a soft copy within CargoWise.\\nStreamlined AR and AP receipts for precision and compliance – GLOBAL\\nWe've introduced a new feature to enhance your experience when entering Receivables or Payables receipts. Now, when selecting a cash account for a receipt or payment transaction in CargoWise, the system automatically defaults the receipt type as 'CSH – Cash'. Additionally, we've implemented a validation to prevent the selection of an incorrect receipt type when using a cash account.\\nThis enhancement proves particularly beneficial in countries where you are required to periodically report all transactions from your cash accounts (virtual accounts maintained for any cash transactions, e.g., Petty Cash, Cash Drawers) to the tax office.\\nSpecifically, it ensures the accurate categorization of all cash receipts, minimizing the risk of errors in your financial records. Moreover, it facilitates the easy extraction and reporting of transactions from CargoWise, improving data integrity and making account reconciliation more seamless.\\nImproved electronic reporting capabilities – TURKEY\\nWe have enhanced two e-reporting statuses in our Transactions Pending Allocation (TPA) and Transactions Pending Allocation Approval (TPAA) modules to provide clearer and more current information about your payables e-invoice transactions in Turkey.\\nWhen CargoWise requests outstanding transactions from the e-invoice provider, any pending transactions are recorded in the TPA and TPAA modules. Payables transactions in these modules fall into three compliance subtypes: PIN (Alış Faturası - Temel), CIN (Satıştan İade Faturası - Temel), and PIC (Alış Faturası - Ticari).\\nToday, commercial e-invoices can be accepted or rejected within a specific timeframe, while Basic e-invoices are considered accepted upon receipt. Transactions with PIN and CIN compliance subtypes can't be rejected and don't require approval, so their initial e-reporting status and message remain unchanged.\\nAfter receiving a Basic e-invoice, CargoWise will now establish its final e-reporting status and message. Transactions with the PIC compliance subtype can be accepted or rejected, and their e-reporting status and message will be updated accordingly.\\nNew Tax IDs to drive compliance – GLOBAL\\nA range of Tax IDs have been extended in CargoWise, including:\\nThe Tax Rate Grids of ‘CAPKM’, ‘KM‘, and ‘KMREV’ have been updated to support the Estonia VAT standard rate change from 20% to 22% on January 1, 2024.\\nThe supported set of Tax IDs in Switzerland has been enhanced with the introduction of four new reduced rate Tax IDs supporting the Swiss 2.5% and 3.7% reduced rates.\\nTVA (VAT) can now be enabled (if required) for French Guiana and Mayotte login companies, where the login company is obligated to record this detail. CargoWise will now record Metropolitan France TVA at 20% or TVA for an Overseas Department at 8.5%.\\nTodas as notícias\\nClientes \\nInformações do setor\\nNotícias da empresa\\nNovidades de produtos\\nÚltimas notícias\\nRecognized by IATA: WiseTech Academy’s dangerous goods training sets the standard\\nFrom manual to high-speed: the power of self-service with CargoWise Neo\\nSEKO Logistics’ journey to enhanced efficiency with CargoWise Certifications\\nVamos nos conectar\\nDescubra como o CargoWise pode ajudar você a eliminar os entraves da logística.\\n  Fale conosco\\n  Soluções\\nAgenciamento de Carga\\nDesembaraço\\nOtimização\\nEmpresarial\\nTransporte\\nTarifas e Contratos\\nArmazém\\nEcommerce\\nEncomendas\\nDados Globais\\nTransportadora\\nConformidade Geográfica\\nRecursos\\nCargoWise Partners\\nSuporte\\nHistórias de clientes\\nNotícias\\nContato\\nWiseTech Global\\nInvestidores\\nCarreiras\\nMinha Conta\\n© 2024 WiseTech Global Mapa do site Departamento Jurídico Configurações de cookies\\n        De volta ao topo\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"E4zhBiJO86IB61tiN5pZVtt8aGt1Kn29O3fdv0EVmdg=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"d8e62171-455e-4e11-b3b5-ef6f209cf9ab":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d8e62171-455e-4e11-b3b5-ef6f209cf9ab\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.santaferelo.com/corporate-relocation/resources/news/corporate-moving-groupage-expansion-to-six-new-destinations/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"We use essential cookies to make our site work.

In our commitment to enhancing international moving solutions, Santa Fe Relocation is thrilled to announce an expansion in our Groupage hot lanes. Following the recent success of our Groupage container loadings from Europe, we are broadening our horizons to include the following destinations:\\nCanada\\nHong Kong\\nIndia\\nSingapore\\nUSA\\nThese new lanes will operate from two primary loading points:\\nAntwerp for Northern Europe\\nBarcelona for Southern Europe\\nEach destination will benefit from a confirmed and prebooked loading day and sailing schedule, promising our clients consistent and reliable transit times.\\nWhat’s the Groupage advantage?\\nGroupage is a potent shipping method where international movers consolidate multiple shipments destined for a shared country in a single container. This method is meticulously managed at Santa Fe Relocation warehouses, from collecting shipments from various shippers to handling all the intricate export customs clearances.\\nOnce the container reaches its destination, a designated agent is responsible for deconsolidation, import customs clearance and ensuring the shipments are safely delivered to the customer’s residence.\\nWhy choose Groupage?\\nChoosing Groupage offers a multitude of benefits, especially for those looking to transport small to medium-sized shipments. By sharing the container space, businesses can significantly reduce shipping costs and carbon footprint. It is an efficient alternative to the LCL (Less than Container Load) and FCL (Full Container Load) services.\\nGo Green with Groupage!\\nOne of the most noteworthy advantages of adopting the Groupage shipping method lies in its significant positive impact on environmental sustainability. By consolidating multiple shipments into a single container, shipping costs are reduced and there is also a substantial reduction in the number of trips and containers needed.\\nThis means fewer ships are deployed, decreasing fuel consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is an excellent strategy for organisations committed to reducing their carbon footprint. Adopting Groupage showcases a company’s sustainability and climate change mitigation responsibility, making it a preferred choice for environmentally-conscious businesses.\\nLet’s talk!\\nGot questions?

By splitting the overall container freight cost with the other shippers, it gives the business a chance to reduce shipping costs.

CargoWise accounting features for global logistics efficiency\\nCategoria\\nNovidades de produtos\\nData\\n4 de dezembro de 2023\\nCompartilhar\\n      As we enter 2024 and anticipate the year ahead, it is evident that numerous logistics providers and carriers are prioritizing cost-cutting measures to mitigate the impact of fluctuating rate levels across the world's major trade lanes.Especially during times of uncertainty, effectively managing a significant volume of accounting tasks with diverse characteristics requires a highly repeatable invoicing and costing process.This process should be flexible enough to adapt to the specific requirements of various jobs, be it forwarding, customs, or any other type.Moreover, it is crucial that this process produces high-quality data, which can be relied upon in downstream processes.Whether dealing with extensive Payables, analyzing weekly job profits, or creating a comprehensive and compliant invoice, the generated data holds paramount importance.This is where software solutions like CargoWise play a pivotal role.With robust accounting and financial management capabilities deeply integrated into a unified logistics execution platform, CargoWise assists global logistics companies in streamlining financial operations while ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and standards.As a product-led business, our focus and investment in product development and innovation are critical.That's why we continuously enhance global accounting features that boost efficiency and provide greater visibility and control over your expenditure and margins.From enhanced FX batch payment functionality to improved electronic invoicing in China and updated electronic reporting in Turkey, here are five of the latest accounting features in CargoWise.Bulk FX transactions in multiple currencies – GLOBAL\\nIn the dynamic world of international trade, overcoming the limitations of funding foreign currency deals with local currency is crucial.Our solution?Choose the currency that aligns best with your financial goals.This powerful new feature allows you to either default to your local currency or opt for a specific currency for funding, ensuring a tailored and efficient transaction process that suits your unique needs.Our native integration with Foreign Exchange specialists, OFX, takes the hassle out of the process by offering a cross rate between your chosen funding currency and the payment currency.This eliminates the need to confine funding your FX deals with local currency, providing you with extra flexibility in the management of your international transactions.But that's not all.You can now elevate your foreign exchange processing capabilities with our enhanced batch payment functionality.In a single payment batch, you can get quotes, book FX deals, and send payments for multiple currencies, funded with your currency of choice.Batch payments are your ticket to a faster, more accurate, and cost-effective payment experience.Enhanced electronic invoicing compliance – CHINA\\nIn China, many of our customers rely on a form of electronic invoicing known as fully digitalized e-fapiao.This differs from both VAT e-fapiao and traditional paper fapiao but holds the same legal standing.The pilot program for fully digitalized e-fapiao commenced on December 1, 2021, with selected taxpayers in Shanghai, Guangdong, and Inner Mongolia (Hohhot) adopting these digital invoices.In 2022 and 2023, more taxpayers joined the program, with the goal of making fully digitalized e-fapiao available nationwide by 2025.Currently, in CargoWise, eligible invoices are sent to RongJin’s Tax Easy portal and set to 'Pending' status.With our latest update, you now have the option to issue the fully digitalized e-fapiao immediately upon posting Receivable Invoices in CargoWise.This is ideal for issuing one fapiao per invoice without additional review in the Tax Easy portal.It's hassle-free – no extra steps are required after posting the Receivable Invoices, and you can easily check the fapiao status and obtain a soft copy within CargoWise.Streamlined AR and AP receipts for precision and compliance – GLOBAL\\nWe've introduced a new feature to enhance your experience when entering Receivables or Payables receipts.Now, when selecting a cash account for a receipt or payment transaction in CargoWise, the system automatically defaults the receipt type as 'CSH – Cash'.Additionally, we've implemented a validation to prevent the selection of an incorrect receipt type when using a cash account.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"EL89LF+bnkpo5/WLRbYfYlrxu/+p78LtluC449pp8+s=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"26711d92-e458-49e4-99f4-a489a3651aad":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"26711d92-e458-49e4-99f4-a489a3651aad\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cargowise.com/pt-br/news/five-new-cargowise-accounting-features-for-global-logistics-efficiency/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"027f80cf-5aa1-44b8-97c1-4b24eb35f483\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cargowise.com/pt-br/news/five-new-cargowise-accounting-features-for-global-logistics-efficiency/\"},\"hash\":\"E4zhBiJO86IB61tiN5pZVtt8aGt1Kn29O3fdv0EVmdg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"12ddd41d-440d-4ebd-a25c-f55b390a0fd6\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cargowise.com/pt-br/news/five-new-cargowise-accounting-features-for-global-logistics-efficiency/\"},\"hash\":\"EL89LF+bnkpo5/WLRbYfYlrxu/+p78LtluC449pp8+s=\"}},\"text\":\"With

selecting a cash account for a receipt or payment transaction in CargoWise, the system automatically defaults the receipt type as 'CSH – Cash'.Additionally, we've implemented a validation to prevent the selection of an incorrect receipt type when using a cash account.This enhancement proves particularly beneficial in countries where you are required to periodically report all transactions from your cash accounts (virtual accounts maintained for any cash transactions, e.g., Petty Cash, Cash Drawers) to the tax office.Specifically, it ensures the accurate categorization of all cash receipts, minimizing the risk of errors in your financial records.Moreover, it facilitates the easy extraction and reporting of transactions from CargoWise, improving data integrity and making account reconciliation more seamless.Improved electronic reporting capabilities – TURKEY\\nWe have enhanced two e-reporting statuses in our Transactions Pending Allocation (TPA) and Transactions Pending Allocation Approval (TPAA) modules to provide clearer and more current information about your payables e-invoice transactions in Turkey.When CargoWise requests outstanding transactions from the e-invoice provider, any pending transactions are recorded in the TPA and TPAA modules.Payables transactions in these modules fall into three compliance subtypes: PIN (Alış Faturası - Temel), CIN (Satıştan İade Faturası - Temel), and PIC (Alış Faturası - Ticari).Today, commercial e-invoices can be accepted or rejected within a specific timeframe, while Basic e-invoices are considered accepted upon receipt.Transactions with PIN and CIN compliance subtypes can't be rejected and don't require approval, so their initial e-reporting status and message remain unchanged.After receiving a Basic e-invoice, CargoWise will now establish its final e-reporting status and message.Transactions with the PIC compliance subtype can be accepted or rejected, and their e-reporting status and message will be updated accordingly.New Tax IDs to drive compliance – GLOBAL\\nA range of Tax IDs have been extended in CargoWise, including:\\nThe Tax Rate Grids of ‘CAPKM’, ‘KM‘, and ‘KMREV’ have been updated to support the Estonia VAT standard rate change from 20% to 22% on January 1, 2024.The supported set of Tax IDs in Switzerland has been enhanced with the introduction of four new reduced rate Tax IDs supporting the Swiss 2.5% and 3.7% reduced rates.TVA (VAT) can now be enabled (if required) for French Guiana and Mayotte login companies, where the login company is obligated to record this detail.CargoWise will now record Metropolitan France TVA at 20% or TVA for an Overseas Department at 8.5%.Todas as notícias\\nClientes \\nInformações do setor\\nNotícias da empresa\\nNovidades de

In our commitment to enhancing international moving solutions, Santa Fe Relocation is thrilled to announce an expansion in our Groupage hot lanes. Following the recent success of our Groupage container loadings from Europe, we are broadening our horizons to include the following destinations:\\nCanada\\nHong Kong\\nIndia\\nSingapore\\nUSA\\nThese new lanes will operate from two primary loading points:\\nAntwerp for Northern Europe\\nBarcelona for Southern Europe\\nEach destination will benefit from a confirmed and prebooked loading day and sailing schedule, promising our clients consistent and reliable transit times.\\nWhat’s the Groupage advantage?\\nGroupage is a potent shipping method where international movers consolidate multiple shipments destined for a shared country in a single container. This method is meticulously managed at Santa Fe Relocation warehouses, from collecting shipments from various shippers to handling all the intricate export customs clearances.\\nOnce the container reaches its destination, a designated agent is responsible for deconsolidation, import customs clearance and ensuring the shipments are safely delivered to the customer’s residence.\\nWhy choose Groupage?\\nChoosing Groupage offers a multitude of benefits, especially for those looking to transport small to medium-sized shipments. By sharing the container space, businesses can significantly reduce shipping costs and carbon footprint. It is an efficient alternative to the LCL (Less than Container Load) and FCL (Full Container Load) services.\\nGo Green with Groupage!\\nOne of the most noteworthy advantages of adopting the Groupage shipping method lies in its significant positive impact on environmental sustainability. By consolidating multiple shipments into a single container, shipping costs are reduced and there is also a substantial reduction in the number of trips and containers needed.\\nThis means fewer ships are deployed, decreasing fuel consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is an excellent strategy for organisations committed to reducing their carbon footprint. Adopting Groupage showcases a company’s sustainability and climate change mitigation responsibility, making it a preferred choice for environmentally-conscious businesses.\\nLet’s talk!\\nGot questions? Curious about our schedules? Or just want to chat about the perks of Groupage? Your local Santa Fe representative is just a call or message away, ready to provide all the insights you need.

Santa Fe Relocation at origin is responsible for the export customs clearance of all the shipments in the container. The container is then shipped to the destination and consigned to a specific agent at a destination that would be responsible for deconsolidation, import customs clearance of all the shipments in the container, and subsequent delivery to the customer’s residence.\\nWhat are the benefits of choosing a Groupage Service?\\nGroupage provides several advantages for international movers that want to ship small to medium size shipments. By splitting the overall container freight cost with the other shippers, it gives the business a chance to reduce shipping costs. Overall, a groupage service might be a good substitute for LCL (Less than Container Load) and FCL (Full Container Load) services.\\n‹ Back to news\\nSign up now to get all the latest updates!\\nSubscribe\\nGet In Touch\\nOur offices\\nChange Language\\nChange Location\\nAbout Us\\nSanta Fe Relocation leadership team\\nPurpose, promise and values\\nCompany history\\nCorporate responsibility\\nAssociations & Accreditations\\nTechnology\\nPart of Mobilitas Group\\nSanta Fe Personal Moves\\nGet a Moving Quote\\nLocal Moving\\nInternational Moving\\nBlog\\nCorporate Relocation\\nMoving\\nAssignment Management\\nCompensation and Expenses\\nCorporate Immigration\\nDestination Services\\nResources\\nBlog\\nWe adhere to the British Association of Removers Alternative Dispute Resolution Scheme which is independently operated by;\\nFurniture & Home Improvement Ombudsman\\n1-5 Argyle Way\\nStevenage\\nHerts\\nSG1 2AD\\nW: www.fhio.org\\nGlobal privacy policy\\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance\\nSitemap\\nCookies Policy\\nConsent Preferences\\nCopyright © 2024 Santa Fe Relocation.
