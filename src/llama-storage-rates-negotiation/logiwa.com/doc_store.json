But for your business logistics should you buy a fleet of Ferraris and helicopters to get there faster? Should you offer the shipping service for free? It all comes down to how much does it cost to ship a package vs. the business benefit. Of course, you want to provide the best service possible, but you have to protect your margins too.\\nIn this article, we’ll take a close look at the main elements that affect shipping expenses as well as methods to drive those costs down to a minimum. Later, we’ll explore how to incorporate shipping into a larger business strategy to score even bigger wins for your company.\\nContents\\nHow much does it cost to ship a package?\\nHow To Reduce Shipping Costs\\nMultiple Fulfillment Zones\\nIt all comes down to ROI\\nEnd-to-End Business Thinking\\nHow much does it cost to ship a package?\\nMany factors must be considered for estimated shipping costs. There’s no single formula as every situation is unique. Still, once you learn about the variables, you can get a better handle on how to estimate costs. Here are the key areas you should know about.\\nPackage Dimension Vs. Weight\\nA long time ago, shippers realized that package size was just as important as package weight. For this reason, most carriers use what’s called “dimensional weight”. This is calculated by multiplying the length x height x width of a package and dividing the result by a standard divisor.\\nNext, the dimensional weight is compared to the actual weight. The higher number is then used as the billable weight.\\nShipping Distance\\nObviously, the shipping charge depends on how far the items will travel. For example, the USPS uses shipping zones to calculate costs. The zones are based on increasing distance from the origin, not on any specific geographic area. The higher the zone, the greater the estimated delivery charge. Here’s the breakdown:\\n  Shipping Zone Mile Radius (from origin)\\nZone 1 (local) 50 mile radius\\nZone 2 51 – 150 mile radius\\nZone 3 151 – 300 mile radius\\nZone 4 301 – 600 mile radius\\nZone 5 601 – 1000 mile radius\\nZone 6 1001 – 1400 mile radius\\nZone 7 1401 – 1800 mile radius\\nZone 8 1801+ mile radius\\nZone 9 Freely Associated States\\n  Rate Tiers\\nNot all shipping pricing is the same as some carriers offer bulk discounts. For example, the USPS has three shipping tiers:\\nRetail – For the everyday customer who ships once in a while.\\nCommercial Base Pricing (CBP) – These rates are for commercial brands and are often included directly with inventory or shipping software accounts. The CBP rate is lower than retail.\\nCommercial Plus Pricing (CPP) – These are the lowest USPS rates and become available when you reach a certain level of shipping over a certain period of time. Some logistic software accounts come with CPP included.\\nIn a similar fashion,UPS offers different shipping options and rates for individuals, small businesses, and mid-to-large sized companies. FedEx also offers shipping deals for businesses, however, it’s not explained in detail on their website.\\nBoth UPS and FedEx may require you to negotiate to get the best deals. For both, getting a better rate structure may require making shipments at standard rates until you reach a threshold.\\nShipping Insurance\\nIf you are shipping high value items, you may need to insure your shipments. That way, if the contents are lost or damaged, you will be reimbursed for some or all of the value. For example, UPS’s liability is limited to US$100 on packages with no declared value. You can declare a higher value, up to US$50,000 per package, by entering the declared value in the UPS shipping system used and paying an additional charge.\\nSome shipping insurance companies may offer discount rates when compared to the standard carrier insurance rates. Also, for items valued at more than US$50,000, you may want to insure them with a specialty insurer.\\nShipping Speed\\nFor every shipping provider, estimated delivery rates also depend on delivery time. The faster it is, the more it costs. For instance, 2-day shipping to Zone 1 can be accomplished by less expensive ground transport. If you ship to a more distant zone, however, it may imply more costly air freight fees.\\nRemember, speed doesn’t depend only on the carrier. If your warehouse isn’t well organized, even the fastest delivery service won’t make up for delayed product selection and packaging. Later, we’ll dig into this topic more and learn about ways to accelerate the process.\\nHow To Reduce Shipping Costs\\nCalculating costs is only part of the picture. You also want to know how to minimize what you spend on shipping. Let’s see how.\\nHave the customer pay for some or all of the shipping\\nPaying for shipping can be done in a variety of ways. Some methods have the customer pay for all or part of the cost. Different shipping payment strategies include:\\nCharge the total shipping amount to the customer up front.\\nYour company pays for the shipping and offers it as a free service.\\nInclude part or all of the shipping in the cost of your product (works best for higher cost items).\\nHave a minimum order amount to quality for free shipping.\\nSeveral factors enter into this decision. For example, even if you offer free shipping, a low cost $7 T-shirt buyer probably won’t buy a shirt for $12 (total of $7 shirt + $5 shipping). However, you might want to offer discounted shipping for the first order, even if it minimizes or eliminates profits. This strategy is useful if you think you can end up converting that first buyer into a long term customer.\\nFlat Rates\\nCarries such as USPS, UPS, and FedEx all offer flat rate services. Flat rates mean you have a variety of standard package sizes to choose from. It also means discounted shipping is applied. So if you don’t absolutely have to use your own packaging, flat rates may be a way to save on shipping.\\nHybrid Services\\nHybrid shipping services use FedEx and/or UPS in combination with USPS for residential deliveries. It works like this. The first leg of pick up and delivery is handled by FedEx or UPS. The last mile delivery is completed by USPS. Remember, it may take longer for this delivery method, but the savings can be significant.\\nMultiple Fulfillment Zones\\nRemember earlier when we mentioned shipping distance and zones? Well, if you have fulfillment centers in key areas, then your shipping estimates may decrease significantly. For example, if most of your orders come from the Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago areas, having a presence in these shipping zones means you can benefit from Zone 1 rates.\\nThis approach might not be feasible for a smaller company on its own, but outsourcing fulfillment to a third party provider can let you leverage a larger distributed warehouse presence.\\nTake Advantage of Outsourced Logistics Shipping\\nToday’s reality is that customers are more demanding than ever. So even though you want to keep shipping expenses low, you need to deliver as fast as possible. One way many companies handle this is to hire a third party to help coordinate warehouse management, logistics, and delivery services.\\nThis strategy can work in your favor in several ways. First, these solutions typically have integrated courier service. This means the process is streamlined from end-to-end which saves time. Also, the providers may already have agreements in place with parcel services, so the lowest rates are built in.\\nIt all comes down to ROI\\nNo matter what approach you take, the best shipping rates will depend on many factors. Even if you establish a method on your own, it will consume resources. Outsourced solutions can do the work for you, plus add other business benefits. So instead of thinking about shipping expenses in a vacuum, you should seek to optimize your entire supply chain.\\nFor instance, software platforms can speed up your warehouse operations with advanced picking, packing, labelling, and storage methodology. This enables faster delivery, and improves your inventory efficiency. Plus, you can integrate ecommerce, billing, and client specific rules to further improve your backend performance.\\nEnd-to-End Business Thinking\\nIf you think holistically about your business, your outcomes will improve. Shipping isn’t just a line item on your company budget. Instead, leverage it as another tool to help your business grow. Consider these stats:\\n41% of consumers are willing to pay an extra charge for same-day delivery.\\nBeyond Amazon, 61% of U.S. and 68% of Canadian shoppers said free delivery is their top consideration for most purchases they make.\\nThis means your shipping strategy can be a business differentiator and potential source of increased revenue. If you deploy the right tools and tactics, it can make a huge difference. In the past, only the largest brands could offer things like next-day shipping. Now, with the right technology, these advantages can be part of nearly any sized company strategy.\\nShip faster than ever. Save on warehouse costs.

That is why shipping rate shopping is necessary for your B2B, DTC, or 3PL enterprise.\\nIf you aren’t constantly seeking out the best shipping rates available, you are wasting money and diminishing your overall profits. Thankfully, you can ensure competitive cost-savings without added hassle with shipping rate shopping software that streamlines the rate shopping process.\\nIn this guide, we explain what shipping rate shopping is, as well as its benefits, how it works, and how you can leverage rate shopping software to achieve better fulfillment results.\\nContents\\nWhat Is Shipping Rate Shopping?\\nThe Benefits of Rate Shopping\\nHow Does Rate Shopping Work?\\nWhat Is Rate Shopping Software?\\nThe Benefits of Shipping Rate Shopping Software\\nWhat Is Shipping Rate Shopping?\\nShipping rate shopping is the process of browsing different carriers to determine which one will provide the lowest shipping rates possible without sacrificing quality. While traditionally completed manually, rate shopping software can now execute the process automatically and in real time.\\nThe Benefits of Rate Shopping\\nShipping rate shopping offers significant value, as it’s about more than just negotiating the best rates or finding a competitor with lower prices. It’s about guaranteeing the best shipping options every time. While it will reduce your costs, it will also significantly improve customer experience.\\nReduces Costs\\nIf you think shipping rate shopping software will help you reduce costs by finding cheaper shipping options, then you’d be right. But that’s just scratching the surface. Shipping rate shopping can help you reduce operational costs in other ways, such as:\\nSecuring cheaper shipping materials\\nIdentifying cost-effective carriers\\nAdding warehouses and distribution centers along more cost-efficient shipping routes\\nRate shopping, which is one aspect of smart shipping, can save your ecommerce operations a lot of time, energy, and money if your operations are willing to remain flexible. And as previously mentioned, you might even be able to bolster customer and client satisfaction along the way.\\nImproves the Customer Experience\\nConsumer expectations are high when it comes to order delivery. According to a recent study by X Delivery, 62% of shoppers expect their orders to arrive in less than three business days when choosing free shipping. In other words, consumers want their shipping cheap and fast.\\nTo deliver on those expectations, you must find a balance between cost and speed. The simplest way to do this is through rate shopping software. By comparing carrier rates, you can improve your customers’ experience while simultaneously reducing delivery time and cost. This can result in even more sales and revenue, as it promotes customer loyalty and increases your fulfillment capacity.\\nTransform your warehouse to a DTC fulfillment center\\nRequest a Demo\\nHow Does Rate Shopping Work?\\nTraditional methods of rate shopping once required you to manually search through multiple pages of carriers and rates. You would need to price each carrier out and then compare and contrast to find the best available option for all your orders.\\nLuckily, this does not need to be the case anymore. Shipping rate shopping software does the heavy lifting for you, so you can compare real-time rates with just the click of a button and one intuitive interface.\\nWhat Is Rate Shopping Software?\\nShipping rate shopping software is a solution that can compare and contrast the rates of a variety of carriers automatically. Beyond shipping rates, rate shopping software can also compare carrier service levels.\\nThis software adjusts to your needs, whether you’re a small, direct-to-consumer (DTC) ecommerce warehouse or a large 3PL network spanning multiple states.\\nRate shopping is typically a feature of full-scale warehouse management system (WMS) platforms as well. If your current WMS software doesn’t include rate shopping, it might be worth considering switching to one that has a built-in tool.\\nThe Benefits of Shipping Rate Shopping Software\\nWhen it comes to using shipping rate shopping software, the obvious benefits are cost savings and an improved customer experience. However, there are plenty of other benefits worth noting.\\nA high-quality shipping rate shopping solution helps mitigate the number of manual tasks required to identify the best rates. Since carrier rates are updated in real-time, you do not need to depend on guesswork and cross-checking to make sure you’re working with the most up-to-date information.\\nLikewise, robust shipping rate shopping software ensures you are always able to provide the best shipping speeds. You won’t need to look up dozens of reviews to figure out which carrier is truly the fastest choice, because all of the real-time data is immediately accessible. This makes it much easier and simpler to meet your fulfillment needs.\\nThe process of managing shipping rates and choosing the best one can be time-consuming. An ideal shipping rate shopping software reduces your time spent selecting the most cost-effective carrier, every time.\\nLogiwa WMS offers built-in smart shipping software as part of our complete Cloud Fulfillment Platform. Our smart shipping software automates the rate shopping process so you always have updated shipping rates, speeds, and comparisons ready at a moment’s notice.\\nAchieve Fulfillment Success With Logiwa WMS\\nShipping rates can eat into the gross revenue of B2B and DTC warehouse operations.

Take shipping, for example. It was once considered a common practice to partner with one carrier for all outgoing orders. Now, thanks to the robust integration and automation capabilities of modern warehouse management systems (WMS), many companies are switching to a multi-carrier shipping approach.\\nHowever, multi-carrier shipping can be tricky to manage. Luckily, warehouse management software can help make it a worthwhile process for your business. Below, we discuss what multi-carrier shipping is, its many competitive benefits, and how a WMS can simplify multi-carrier shipping for your business.\\nIn this blog, we will discuss:\\nWhat Is Multi-Carrier Shipping?\\nThe Benefits of Multi-Carrier Shipping\\nHow WMS Software Simplifies Multi-Carrier Shipping\\nProvides Access to All Carriers in One Place\\nAutomates Rate Shopping & More\\nIncreases Visibility Through Analytics\\nEasily Integrates With Other Multi-Carrier Solutions\\nHow the Logiwa WMS Cloud Fulfillment Platform Can Help\\nWhat Is Multi-Carrier Shipping?\\nIn simple terms, multi-carrier shipping is the process of using a variety of carriers to fulfill your order delivery needs. In a more complete sense, it includes switching between various carriers, coordinating with warehouses based on inventory availability, and picking delivery options which guarantee the most efficient route to customers.\\nThere are a lot of moving parts to consider when adopting multi-carrier shipping, so it is important to plan for the unique needs of your business. For example, if you’re shipping locally, it might be more cost-effective to use a local carrier to pick up and deliver orders. However, for packages that need to be transported across state or international lines, you will need a carrier capable of safe, long-distance shipping.\\nThe Benefits of Multi-Carrier Shipping\\nWhile there are challenges when utilizing multi-carrier shipping, it’s still a popular practice throughout the logistics industry due to its benefits. These benefits can include better delivery success rates and cost savings to customer satisfaction and fulfillment network growth.\\nMulti-carrier shipping helps to reduce shipping costs by enabling you to choose from the best rates, routes, and transit times for each of your direct-to-consumer (DTC) or B2B orders. And with a leading WMS solution, you can even automate carrier selection based on pre-set criteria and order-specific needs – empowering your team to make the best choice every time.\\nMulti-carrier shipping ultimately streamlines shipping processes to provide a better experience for your end consumers. When you can select a carrier based on the quickest transit time, it becomes much easier to meet steep consumer demands. Overall, multi-carrier shipping provides the most flexibility for both consumers and your fulfillment operations.\\nTransform your warehouse to a DTC fulfillment center\\nRequest a Demo\\nHow WMS Software Simplifies Multi-Carrier Shipping\\nThe complexities of multi-carrier shipping can be reduced by implementing warehouse management software (WMS). This is because a WMS:\\nProvides access to all carriers in one place. Rather than having to hunt down the carriers who might be available for you, WMS software pulls them all together for you in one place.\\nAutomates rate shopping and more. Great WMS software makes sure you always have the best rates, carriers, and delivery options for your shipments.\\nIncreases visibility through analytics. Having access to all the data you need can ensure you make the most informed decision about which carrier to use for each shipment.\\nEasily integrates with other multi-carrier solutions. The right WMS software will integrate with other tools you use in your multi-carrier shipping process, such as your ecommerce platform.\\n#1. Provides Access to All Carriers in One Place\\nTracking down and managing all the carriers who might be available to help with your shipping operations can be overwhelming. A WMS can help with pivoting to multi-carrier shipping by offering access to carriers within its systems and organizing them all in one place. By providing direct integrations to reputable carriers, it ensures you have the best options for your specific needs right at your fingertips.\\nSome WMS platforms, such as Logiwa WMS, come integrated with all the most popular carriers. This makes it simple to start taking advantage of multi-carrier shipping right from the start.\\n#2. Automates Rate Shopping & More\\nMulti-carrier shipping is only as effective as your ability to consistently shop for and choose the best shipping rates. Great WMS software will automate the entire rate shopping process, so you don’t have to spend time manually comparing rates and carriers before each of your shipments.\\nLogiwa WMS can automate rate shopping, as well as processes like inventory management, labeling and shipping box selection, so multi-carrier shipping can be completed quickly and simply.\\n#3. Increases Visibility Through Analytics\\nTo make the most of multi-carrier shipping, you need access to reports that can show this method is helping reduce your costs, move shipments faster, and increase customer satisfaction. If you aren’t able to validate whether or not multi-carrier shipping is helping your company, then you could be wasting your efforts.\\nLogiwa Analytics was created to provide fulfillment operations with the powerful data insights needed to root out inefficiencies and promote informed decision-making.

Most operations have at least some leverageable data available, but it may be coming from disparate sources in different formats, making it difficult to use. Effectively analyzing data can help uncover actionable insights to drive more efficient and accurate operations at scale.\\nWatch “Winning DTC Fulfillment with Analytics” for more information.\\n  Understand how artificial intelligence is changing the game\\nDTC fulfillment operations face complex supply chain and warehousing challenges, so ensuring flawless delivery experiences can be a daunting task. AI can streamline operations on multiple levels –  from AI-powered picking robots to actionable supply chain analytics- helping you make better decisions and optimize day-to-day operations.\\nGet the e-book on “The Critical Role of Artificial Intelligence in Warehouse Operations.”\\n  Leverage automation for higher productivity at a lower cost\\nEvery shipping warehouse must balance speed and accuracy in addition to meeting higher volumes and competitive fulfillment standards—without causing undue stress to operations. How is that possible? Many DTC operations are meeting these challenges with automation, and seeing lower costs, higher accuracy and faster fulfillment as a result.\\nRead “Tackling DTC Shipping Warehouse Challenges with Automation” to discover how automation takes on DTC challenges.\\n  Robotics as an extension of your labor force\\nImplementing robotics has revolutionized many industries and operations, and DTC fulfillment is no exception. Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) can navigate the warehouse floor, picking and transporting goods while minimizing errors and maximizing productivity. Integrating robotics with a warehouse management system (WMS) can further increase those efficiencies and help overcome common DTC fulfillment challenges.\\nLearn “Where to Start With WMS Robotics” in our online guide.\\nBring it all together with the right WMS\\nHandle volume with accuracy and speed\\nA warehouse management system (WMS) integrates analytics, automation, AI, robotics and customer data into a fulfillment powerhouse. The right WMS provides the information and tools to handle higher volumes, optimize picking paths, reduce shipping costs, standardize fulfillment processes and more.\\nWhen their previous WMS couldn’t handle their peak season volume, Deliverr knew it was time for a change. After a rigorous evaluation, they implemented Logiwa. Deliverr was able to onboard quickly, enabling them to handle 10x the volume without a hitch.\\nDiscover how “Deliverr Scales Logiwa WMS Across 40 Warehouses in One Year”.\\nWhat to look for in a WMS\\nOrder fulfillment is a complex affair. It’s a multifaceted process that begins from the moment a customer places an order. Hundreds ( even thousands) of orders are picked, packed, and shipped daily—requiring inventory levels, warehouse stock, labor requirements, shipping logistics, returns and exchanges to be managed with care.\\nThis process can quickly turn into a logistical nightmare unless, of course, you have the right warehouse fulfillment software.\\nMake sure to consider these factors when evaluating WMS software:\\nCan you access and analyze real-time data to make better decisions?\\nIs the WMS equipped with AI and machine learning algorithms that can continuously learn and adapt for you? These features take the guesswork out of inventory levels, picking paths, forecasting and more.\\nCan the system scale easily to support your peak volumes and projected growth? What if you want to add more fulfillment centers or SKUs? Plan for seasonality, flexibility and growth.\\nHow does the system handle software updates and industry innovation? Will you still be using this system in two years, or five, if technology evolves? A cloud-based SaaS system will be more future-proof because it can be continuously updated remotely.\\nCan the solution eliminate any paper-based processes? Manual, paper-based operations are prone to errors, so a WMS that relies on outdated processes won’t be as accurate as a fully digital solution.\\nCan you easily integrate the WMS with other tools, including automations, robotics and ecommerce platforms? Integrations give WMS solutions accurate real-time data, allowing it to create better processes and help you make better decisions.\\nDid you know?\\nLogiwa’s SaaS cloud fulfillment platform comes highly connected with pre-built  integrations. From Amazon to Shopify, Locus Robotics, UPS, FedEx and more. And our Integrations Orchestrator ensures we offer the most well-connected fulfillment platform available..\\n  See all of our of pre-built integrations >\\nCalculate the ROI of your WMS\\nSoftware systems can be expensive in terms of both time and money, but the fact is that a WMS can save your business money—while setting you up for future growth.\\nUsing the data you already have, you can easily calculate the ROI of a warehouse management system with this simple Excel tool.\\nGet your WMS ROI calculator >\\nDTC Fulfillment Software Platform\\nThe Logiwa Cloud Fulfillment Platform is a fully integrated Warehouse Management System and order fulfillment system that empowers companies to run a digital fulfillment network and grow their DTC business—without additional headcount.\\nConnected Ecommerce\\nSell more with a fully integrated inventory management system that connects seamlessly with the most leading ecommerce, marketplace, and order management systems.\\nDiscover more\\nDigital Warehousing\\nRun a fully digital fulfillment center with mobile apps, smart job batching, automation rules, real-time exception handling, and online reports.\\nDiscover more\\nSmart Shipping\\nSave time and money with Logiwa’s shipping software, enjoy price-optimized carrier selection and auto-printed shipping labels that process orders out the door faster.\\nDiscover more\\nTotal Control\\nEasily update and extend your Logiwa system in minutes not months: create warehouse layouts, process orders, update automation rules, and bring a new fulfillment center online with clicks not code.\\nDiscover more\\nThe Benefits of Logiwa’s Warehouse Management Software\\nImproved Inventory Accuracy and Visibility\\nAutomate inbound logistics and optimize inventory locations in each of your warehouses.

As returned merchandise comes back in, Nok's system enables efficient receiving and evaluation of those units. For brands and retailers, this granular data enables accurate and speedy reconciliation of returns as well as disposition–including restock, resale, refurbishment, recycle and donation.

Weight\\nA long time ago, shippers realized that package size was just as important as package weight.For this reason, most carriers use what’s called “dimensional weight”.This is calculated by multiplying the length x height x width of a package and dividing the result by a standard divisor.Next, the dimensional weight is compared to the actual weight.The higher number is then used as the billable weight.Shipping Distance\\nObviously, the shipping charge depends on how far the items will travel.For example, the USPS uses shipping zones to calculate costs.The zones are based on increasing distance from the origin, not on any specific geographic area.The higher the zone, the greater the estimated delivery charge.Here’s the breakdown:\\n  Shipping Zone Mile Radius (from origin)\\nZone 1 (local) 50 mile radius\\nZone 2 51 – 150 mile radius\\nZone 3 151 – 300 mile radius\\nZone 4 301 – 600 mile radius\\nZone 5 601 – 1000 mile radius\\nZone 6 1001 – 1400 mile radius\\nZone 7 1401 – 1800 mile radius\\nZone 8 1801+ mile radius\\nZone 9 Freely Associated States\\n  Rate Tiers\\nNot all shipping pricing is the same as some carriers offer bulk discounts.For example, the USPS has three shipping tiers:\\nRetail – For the everyday customer who ships once in a while.Commercial Base Pricing (CBP) – These rates are for commercial brands and are often included directly with inventory or shipping software accounts.The CBP rate is lower than retail.Commercial Plus Pricing (CPP) – These are the lowest USPS rates and become available when you reach a certain level of shipping over a certain period of time.Some logistic software accounts come with CPP included.In a similar fashion,UPS offers different shipping options and rates for individuals, small businesses, and mid-to-large sized companies.FedEx also offers shipping deals for businesses, however, it’s not explained in detail on their website.Both UPS and FedEx may require you to negotiate to get the best deals.For both, getting a better rate structure may require making shipments at standard rates until you reach a threshold.Shipping Insurance\\nIf you are shipping high value items, you may need to insure your shipments.That way, if the contents are lost or damaged, you will be reimbursed for some or all of the value.For example, UPS’s liability is limited to US$100 on packages with no declared value.You can declare a higher value, up to US$50,000 per package, by entering the declared value in the UPS shipping system used and paying an additional charge.Some shipping insurance companies may offer discount rates when compared to the standard carrier insurance rates.Also, for items valued at more than US$50,000, you may want to insure them with a specialty insurer.Shipping Speed\\nFor every shipping provider, estimated delivery rates also depend on delivery time.The faster it is, the more it costs.For instance, 2-day shipping to Zone 1 can be accomplished by less expensive ground transport.If you ship to a more distant zone, however, it may imply more costly air freight fees.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"vG90KBkZhjP38saA0gfx6novbQOBJBm8ZEcCZ9Ss4pA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"82474c44-e840-47f1-a3cb-a838d4e3140f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"82474c44-e840-47f1-a3cb-a838d4e3140f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.logiwa.com/blog/shipping-cost-calculator-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"52e4b46d-ab11-4e7b-bce9-b8a5cb02446b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.logiwa.com/blog/shipping-cost-calculator-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs\"},\"hash\":\"8PAzqxCuSkFFEekqwULJ91tBOc1QEKxdpi0VhTCZil8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"7e6d46e8-7a6d-47f0-8fe3-81371d29636c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.logiwa.com/blog/shipping-cost-calculator-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs\"},\"hash\":\"vG90KBkZhjP38saA0gfx6novbQOBJBm8ZEcCZ9Ss4pA=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b464c64e-5748-407d-ba61-631e77597730\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"owDDPJh5CLJav0Q/e5n+JqTu+INPSCAAxM1KIu37dEk=\"}},\"text\":\"That

estimated delivery rates also depend on delivery time.The faster it is, the more it costs.For instance, 2-day shipping to Zone 1 can be accomplished by less expensive ground transport.If you ship to a more distant zone, however, it may imply more costly air freight fees.Remember, speed doesn’t depend only on the carrier.If your warehouse isn’t well organized, even the fastest delivery service won’t make up for delayed product selection and packaging.Later, we’ll dig into this topic more and learn about ways to accelerate the process.How To Reduce Shipping Costs\\nCalculating costs is only part of the picture.You also want to know how to minimize what you spend on shipping.Let’s see how.Have the customer pay for some or all of the shipping\\nPaying for shipping can be done in a variety of ways.Some methods have the customer pay for all or part of the cost.Different shipping payment strategies include:\\nCharge the total shipping amount to the customer up front.Your company pays for the shipping and offers it as a free service.Include part or all of the shipping in the cost of your product (works best for higher cost items).Have a minimum order amount to quality for free shipping.Several factors enter into this decision.For example, even if you offer free shipping, a low cost $7 T-shirt buyer probably won’t buy a shirt for $12 (total of $7 shirt + $5 shipping).However, you might want to offer discounted shipping for the first order, even if it minimizes or eliminates profits.This strategy is useful if you think you can end up converting that first buyer into a long term customer.Flat Rates\\nCarries such as USPS, UPS, and FedEx all offer flat rate services.Flat rates mean you have a variety of standard package sizes to choose from.It also means discounted shipping is applied.So if you don’t absolutely have to use your own packaging, flat rates may be a way to save on shipping.Hybrid Services\\nHybrid shipping services use FedEx and/or UPS in combination with USPS for residential deliveries.It works like this.The first leg of pick up and delivery is handled by FedEx or UPS.The last mile delivery is completed by USPS.Remember, it may take longer for this delivery method, but the savings can be significant.Multiple Fulfillment Zones\\nRemember earlier when we mentioned shipping distance and zones?Well, if you have fulfillment centers in key areas, then your shipping estimates may decrease significantly.For example, if most of your orders come from the Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago areas, having a presence in these shipping zones means you can benefit from Zone 1 rates.This approach might not be feasible for a smaller company on its own, but outsourcing fulfillment to a third party provider can let you leverage a larger distributed warehouse presence.Take Advantage of Outsourced Logistics Shipping\\nToday’s reality is that customers are more demanding than ever.So even though you want to keep shipping expenses low, you need to deliver as fast as possible.One way many companies handle this is to hire a third party to help coordinate warehouse management, logistics, and delivery services.This strategy can work in your favor in several ways.First, these solutions typically have integrated courier service.This means the process is streamlined from end-to-end which saves time.Also, the providers may already have agreements in place with parcel services, so the lowest rates are built in.It all comes down to ROI\\nNo matter what approach you take, the best shipping rates will depend on many factors.Even if you establish a method on your own, it will consume resources.Outsourced solutions can do the work for you, plus add other business benefits.So instead of thinking about shipping expenses in a vacuum, you should seek to optimize your entire supply chain.For instance, software platforms can speed up your warehouse operations with advanced picking, packing, labelling, and storage methodology.This enables faster delivery, and improves your inventory efficiency.Plus, you can integrate ecommerce, billing, and client specific rules to further improve your backend performance.End-to-End Business Thinking\\nIf you think holistically about your business, your outcomes will improve.Shipping isn’t just a line item on your company budget.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"Z3cjxmHEMt+6xc+J4XMLCI7xOExryG3yVrLLzWN+Fe4=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b464c64e-5748-407d-ba61-631e77597730":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b464c64e-5748-407d-ba61-631e77597730\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.logiwa.com/blog/shipping-cost-calculator-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"52e4b46d-ab11-4e7b-bce9-b8a5cb02446b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.logiwa.com/blog/shipping-cost-calculator-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs\"},\"hash\":\"8PAzqxCuSkFFEekqwULJ91tBOc1QEKxdpi0VhTCZil8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"82474c44-e840-47f1-a3cb-a838d4e3140f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.logiwa.com/blog/shipping-cost-calculator-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs\"},\"hash\":\"I44aTauVpQqtQS+jMec59RaJfZhA6DrpDcFr8HDblR0=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"bcfc1653-7ccc-4918-9207-66977789fe1e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"dDxn/kME9bNBMIUL2bfI3xJ60taKcUTNUPByk3ekcq8=\"}},\"text\":\"Also,

free delivery is their top consideration for most purchases they make.This means your shipping strategy can be a business differentiator and potential source of increased revenue.If you deploy the right tools and tactics, it can make a huge difference.In the past, only the largest brands could offer things like next-day shipping.Now, with the right technology, these advantages can be part of nearly any sized company strategy.Ship faster than ever.Save on warehouse costs.Schedule a WMS demo today.Adjust quickly to ever-changing fulfillment requirements with the most flexible

Shipment Warehouse Management WMS\\nWritten by: Ayca Ozcan\\nOriginally published on April 11, 2023, Updated on July 31, 2024\\nWhen it comes to ecommerce fulfillment, shipping rates can eat into

also significantly improve customer experience.Reduces Costs\\nIf you think shipping rate shopping software will help you reduce costs by finding cheaper shipping options, then you’d be right.But that’s just scratching the surface.Shipping rate shopping can help you reduce operational costs in other ways, such as:\\nSecuring cheaper shipping materials\\nIdentifying cost-effective carriers\\nAdding warehouses and distribution centers along more cost-efficient shipping routes\\nRate shopping, which is one aspect of smart shipping, can save your ecommerce operations a lot of time, energy, and money if your operations are willing to remain flexible.And as previously mentioned, you might even be able to bolster customer and client satisfaction along the way.Improves the Customer Experience\\nConsumer expectations are high when it comes to order delivery.According to a recent study by X Delivery, 62% of shoppers expect their orders to arrive in less than three business days when choosing free shipping.In other words, consumers want their shipping cheap and fast.To deliver on those expectations, you must find a balance between cost and speed.The simplest way to do this is through rate shopping software.By comparing carrier rates, you can improve your customers’ experience while simultaneously reducing delivery time and cost.This can result in even more sales and revenue, as it promotes customer loyalty and increases your fulfillment capacity.Transform your warehouse to a DTC fulfillment center\\nRequest a Demo\\nHow Does Rate Shopping Work?Traditional methods of rate shopping once required you to manually search through multiple pages of carriers and rates.You would need to price each carrier out and then compare and contrast to find the best available option for all your orders.Luckily, this does not need to be the case anymore.Shipping rate shopping software does the heavy lifting for you, so you can compare real-time rates with just the click of a button and one intuitive interface.What Is Rate Shopping Software?Shipping rate shopping software is a solution that can compare and contrast the rates of a variety of carriers automatically.Beyond shipping rates, rate shopping software can also compare carrier service levels.This software adjusts to your needs, whether you’re a small, direct-to-consumer (DTC) ecommerce warehouse or a large 3PL network spanning multiple states.Rate shopping is typically a feature of full-scale warehouse management system (WMS) platforms as well.If your current WMS software doesn’t include rate shopping, it might be worth considering switching to one that has a built-in tool.The Benefits of Shipping Rate Shopping Software\\nWhen it comes to using shipping rate shopping software, the obvious benefits are cost savings and an improved customer experience.However, there are plenty of other benefits worth noting.A high-quality shipping rate shopping solution helps mitigate the number of manual tasks required to identify the best rates.Since carrier rates are updated in real-time, you do not need to depend on guesswork and cross-checking to make sure you’re working with the most up-to-date information.Likewise, robust shipping rate shopping software ensures you are always able to provide the best shipping speeds.You won’t need to look up dozens of reviews to figure out which carrier is truly the fastest choice, because all of the real-time data is immediately accessible.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"hs7y7UKz+XdmehxOkUtUkc2Z47fd5qNFKFpNvfF3yrg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"df99142d-f118-4c6e-8d7b-90189fa3a145":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"df99142d-f118-4c6e-8d7b-90189fa3a145\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.logiwa.com/blog/what-is-shipping-rate-shopping\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"663b7893-e45d-43fa-b7c6-689c5a3c0ea6\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.logiwa.com/blog/what-is-shipping-rate-shopping\"},\"hash\":\"EbUwMeDjIBdjH+cJogw0oPk3PlogQvUzsGIA8jla25w=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a0d1d90e-4736-473d-ba2a-338a6cffe2f2\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.logiwa.com/blog/what-is-shipping-rate-shopping\"},\"hash\":\"hs7y7UKz+XdmehxOkUtUkc2Z47fd5qNFKFpNvfF3yrg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"2b8d2b8d-8885-4d76-9f5e-14e146d8c6af\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"dDxn/kME9bNBMIUL2bfI3xJ60taKcUTNUPByk3ekcq8=\"}},\"text\":\"Rate

Warehouse Management WMS\\nWritten by: Erhan Musaoglu\\nOriginally published on April 4, 2023, Updated on July 31, 2024\\nJust as technologies evolve to support the needs of modern fulfillment operations, the logistics industry is also changing with each technological advancement.Take shipping, for example.It was once considered a common practice to partner with one carrier for all outgoing orders.Now, thanks to the robust integration and automation capabilities of modern warehouse management systems (WMS), many companies are switching to a multi-carrier shipping approach.However, multi-carrier shipping can be tricky to manage.Luckily, warehouse management software can help make it a worthwhile process for your business.Below, we discuss what multi-carrier shipping is, its many competitive benefits, and how a WMS can simplify multi-carrier shipping for your business.In this blog, we will discuss:\\nWhat Is Multi-Carrier Shipping?The Benefits of Multi-Carrier Shipping\\nHow WMS Software Simplifies Multi-Carrier Shipping\\nProvides Access to All Carriers in One Place\\nAutomates Rate Shopping & More\\nIncreases Visibility Through Analytics\\nEasily Integrates With Other Multi-Carrier Solutions\\nHow the Logiwa WMS Cloud Fulfillment Platform Can Help\\nWhat Is Multi-Carrier Shipping?In simple terms, multi-carrier shipping is the process of using a variety of carriers to fulfill your order delivery needs.In a more complete sense, it includes switching between various carriers, coordinating with warehouses based on inventory availability, and picking delivery options which guarantee the most efficient route to customers.There are a lot of moving parts to consider when adopting multi-carrier shipping, so it is important to plan for the unique needs of your business.For example, if you’re shipping locally, it might be more cost-effective to use a local carrier to pick up and deliver orders.However, for packages that need to be transported across state or international lines, you will need a carrier capable of safe, long-distance shipping.The Benefits of Multi-Carrier Shipping\\nWhile there are challenges when utilizing multi-carrier shipping, it’s still a popular practice throughout the logistics industry due to its benefits.These benefits can include better delivery success rates and cost savings to customer satisfaction and fulfillment network growth.Multi-carrier shipping helps to reduce shipping costs by enabling you to choose from the best rates, routes, and transit times for each of your direct-to-consumer (DTC) or B2B orders.And with a leading WMS solution, you can even automate carrier selection based on pre-set criteria and order-specific needs – empowering your team to make the best choice every time.Multi-carrier shipping ultimately streamlines shipping processes to provide a better experience for your end consumers.When you can select a carrier based on the quickest transit time, it becomes much easier to meet steep consumer demands.Overall, multi-carrier shipping provides the most flexibility for both consumers and your fulfillment operations.Transform your warehouse to a DTC fulfillment center\\nRequest a Demo\\nHow WMS Software Simplifies Multi-Carrier Shipping\\nThe complexities of multi-carrier shipping can be reduced by implementing warehouse management software (WMS).This is because a WMS:\\nProvides access to all carriers in one place.Rather than having to hunt down the carriers who might be available for you, WMS software pulls them all together for you in

fulfillment success\\nThe ecommerce landscape has seen unprecedented growth in online shopping over the past few years.As ecommerce transactions increase, direct-to-consumer (DTC) warehousing and fulfillment operations must adapt to meet the rising order volumes and delivery expectations of consumers.DTC fulfillment excellence requires high levels of speed, accuracy and flexibility to manage complex logistics and consistently meet demand.Unlike a B2B environment, where one customer is shipped 10,000 units, DTC networks may have 10,000 customers ordering one unit each.DTC fulfillment software solutions are helping operations evolve to handle the scalability and agility required to satisfy today’s ecommerce consumers.The State of Fulfillment 2024\\nManaging change and ensuring ROI, speed and agility in a DTC world\\nInterested in learning more about the challenges facing DTC fulfillment, and what top performers are doing to overcome them?Get the guide to learn how to embrace innovation and customer-centricity to take your DTC fulfillment into the future.Download the e-book >\\nCustomer expectations are shifting—have your processes?The ecommerce sector has grown exponentially, and customers expect more in a click-and-ship economy.To meet this challenge, you’ll need to leverage data and cutting-edge tech to automate processes and improve efficiency.Learn more about adapting to the trends shaping the fulfillment landscape in our blog, “5 Trends Reshaping the Logistics and Fulfillment Landscape”.Where to begin your DTC fulfillment optimization\\nChanging processes, equipment and software can be a daunting concept, and may involve some upfront investment and additional training.If you’re not sure where to start, you may be able to realize a few quick wins with these strategies:\\n5 Ways You Can Succeed as a High-Volume DTC Business\\nHow DTC Operations are Keeping Up\\nAnalytics\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nAutomation\\nRobotics\\nTurn analytics into actionable intelligence\\nHigh-volume fulfillment operations rely on data.Most operations have at least some leverageable data available, but it may be coming from disparate sources in different formats, making it difficult to use.Effectively analyzing data can help uncover actionable insights to drive more efficient and accurate operations at scale.Watch “Winning DTC Fulfillment with Analytics” for more information.Understand how artificial intelligence is changing the game\\nDTC fulfillment operations face complex supply chain and warehousing challenges, so ensuring flawless delivery experiences can be a daunting task.AI can streamline operations on multiple levels –  from AI-powered picking robots to actionable supply chain analytics- helping you make better decisions and optimize day-to-day operations.Get the e-book on “The Critical Role of Artificial Intelligence in Warehouse Operations.”Leverage automation for higher productivity at a lower cost\\nEvery shipping warehouse must balance speed and accuracy in addition to meeting higher volumes and competitive fulfillment standards—without causing undue stress to operations.How is that possible?Many DTC operations are meeting these challenges with automation, and seeing lower costs, higher accuracy and faster fulfillment as a result.Read “Tackling DTC Shipping Warehouse Challenges with Automation” to discover how automation takes on DTC challenges.Robotics as an extension of your labor force\\nImplementing robotics has revolutionized many industries and operations, and DTC fulfillment is no exception.Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) can navigate the warehouse floor, picking and transporting goods while minimizing errors and maximizing productivity.Integrating robotics with a warehouse management system (WMS) can further increase those efficiencies and help overcome common DTC fulfillment challenges.Learn “Where to Start With WMS Robotics” in our online guide.Bring it all together with the right WMS\\nHandle volume with accuracy and speed\\nA warehouse management system (WMS) integrates analytics, automation, AI, robotics and customer data into a fulfillment powerhouse.The right WMS provides the information and tools to handle higher volumes, optimize picking paths, reduce shipping costs, standardize fulfillment processes and more.When their previous WMS couldn’t handle their peak season volume, Deliverr knew it was time for a change.After a rigorous evaluation, they implemented Logiwa.Deliverr was able to onboard quickly, enabling them to handle 10x the volume

moment a customer places an order.Hundreds ( even thousands) of orders are picked, packed, and shipped daily—requiring inventory levels, warehouse stock, labor requirements, shipping logistics, returns and exchanges to be managed with care.This process can quickly turn into a logistical nightmare unless, of course, you have the right warehouse fulfillment software.Make sure to consider these factors when evaluating WMS software:\\nCan you access and analyze real-time data to make better decisions?Is the WMS equipped with AI and machine learning algorithms that can continuously learn and adapt for you?These features take the guesswork out of inventory levels, picking paths, forecasting and more.Can the system scale easily to support your peak volumes and projected growth?What if you want to add more fulfillment centers or SKUs?Plan for seasonality, flexibility and growth.How does the system handle software updates and industry innovation?Will you still be using this system in two years, or five, if technology evolves?A cloud-based SaaS system will be more future-proof because it can be continuously updated remotely.Can the solution eliminate any paper-based processes?Manual, paper-based operations are prone to errors, so a WMS that relies on outdated processes won’t be as accurate as a fully digital solution.Can you easily integrate the WMS with other tools, including automations, robotics and ecommerce platforms?Integrations give WMS solutions accurate real-time data, allowing it to create better processes and help you make better decisions.Did you know?Logiwa’s SaaS cloud fulfillment platform comes highly connected with pre-built  integrations.From Amazon to Shopify, Locus Robotics, UPS, FedEx and more.And our Integrations Orchestrator ensures we offer the most well-connected fulfillment platform available..See all of our of pre-built integrations >\\nCalculate the ROI of your WMS\\nSoftware systems can be expensive in terms of both time and money, but

reverse logistics and bring end-to-end visibility through the full life cycle of returns\\nBy DC Velocity Staff\\nJan 10, 2024\\nLAS VEGAS, Jan.9, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Today from the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show it was announced that Nok Recommerce, the circular operating system for full-service reverse logistics and multi-channel recommerce, will collaborate with Logiwa Inc., a leading cloud based fulfillment management system (FMS) for high-volume fulfillment businesses, to provide deeper transparency and increased efficiencies across the reverse supply chain.The benefits of this partnership are best illustrated when one considers the journey of the reverse-supply chain.As returned merchandise comes back in, Nok's system enables efficient receiving and evaluation of those units.For brands and retailers, this granular data enables accurate and speedy reconciliation of returns as well as disposition–including restock, resale, refurbishment, recycle and donation.Non-new units routed for resale can be auto listed across brand selected channels through Nok's platform.Go Deeper\\nAI Powered\\nKaleris and Navis merge companies to create cloud-based

said Nok CEO Bobby Wann.\\\"Our goal is not to own every stage of the process, but instead to provide a neutral framework under which other services can excel and customers can receive the best possible support.Nok manages revenue recovery channels, ensuring brands and retailers maximize incremental sales through resale (without cannibalizing primary sales channels).By bringing data visibility and traceability to the forefront of the reverse supply chain, Logiwa and Nok are able to establish heightened industry standards for accountability, brand integrity, and reporting practices in reverse logistics.The net positive in the collaboration for shared customers is far greater than the sum of the whole, resulting in massive data efficiencies through improved visibility
