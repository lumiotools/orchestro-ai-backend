Tracking Logistics KPIs and Achieve Your Business Goals\nExplore the more common logistics company goals and align them with the core KPIs, allowing you to stay on target and work as efficiently as possible.Sprint Logistics\nJune 10, 2022\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) are at the heart of your logistics business’ success.KPIs collate data which enables you to zero in on what is working in your business and what isn’t, revealing your strengths and weaknesses.This knowledge allows you to build on what you’re doing right and work on what you could improve.But as each logistics company has its own unique goals, a one-size-fits-all approach to tracking KPIs doesn’t work.Goals also change with time, so the logistics KPIs that you utilise this year may not be helpful next year.Let’s go over some of the more common logistics company goals and align them with the core KPIs, allowing you to stay on target and work as efficiently as possible.Decreasing shipping costs\nIt usually falls to managers to reduce shipping costs, but there are several strategies you can deploy today to further facilitate these reductions.One is to utilise a transportation management system (TMS).But before settling on a strategy, you need to get a clean read of your total freight spend.This includes packing, shipping, TMS fees, staff pay, the cost of maintaining your fleet, and so on.Here’s a list of cost indicator KPIs you can apply to your business:\nSales vs. outbound freight costs\nPurchases vs. inbound freight costs\nFreight cost per unit shipped\nPer unit TMS cost\nQuote vs. actual invoiced costs\nManaging freight costs\nIt’s vital to manage and track your freight specific rates in order to establish a complete view of your logistics costs.Freight rate management KPIs are therefore at the core of your logistics scorecard.Here are some freight rate management KPIs to consider:\nPerfect order percentage\nAverage cost of transportation per kilometre\nDetentions\nDelays\nFuel efficiency assessments\nService performance improvement\nEnsuring quality service performance triggers a positive chain reaction across other goals, such as bettering customer experience and relations.Thus, service performance KPIs should be a part of your operational scorecard.Some suggested service performance metrics to track:\nDamage rate / cargo loss\nClaims percentages\nLabour productivity\nAverage loading and unloading times\nPlanned time in transit vs. actual\nCarrier and inbound vendor compliance management\nTo reduce shipping costs and manage supply chain discrepancy risks, proper carrier and inbound vendor compliance is essential.Getting out of step with compliance puts your business at risk of fines, damaged freight, delayed shipments and more.Carrier and inbound vendor compliance KPIs to track:\nLoad acceptance and rejection metrics\nPercent trucking capacity\nFreight billing accuracy\nKilometres driven outside prescribed routes\nRouting guide compliance\nTeaming up with Sprint Logistics\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) remain vital to effective, smoothly running logistics operations, and utilising a logistics scorecard to monitor strengths and weaknesses is a good way to ensure that your business performs up to its potential.Our team of experts at Sprint Logistics are here to help you achieve your logistics goals.Find out more

Fulfilment: Key Considerations for Global Expansion\nExpanding your e-commerce business globally can be a lucrative opportunity for growth. However, it also comes with unique fulfilment challenges.\nSprint Logistics\nMarch 20, 2023\nExpanding your e-commerce business globally can be a lucrative opportunity for growth. However, it also comes with unique fulfilment challenges. To ensure a successful international e-commerce fulfilment strategy, here are some key considerations to keep in mind:\nUnderstand local regulations:\nWhen shipping products globally, it’s crucial to understand the regulations and compliance requirements for each country. Each country has its own set of import/export rules, taxes, and tariffs that must be followed to avoid delays, penalties, or even legal repercussions. It’s important to research and comply with all relevant regulations to ensure that your products can be shipped smoothly.\nPartner with local providers:\nWorking with local fulfilment providers can help you navigate local regulations, reduce shipping times and costs, and provide a better customer experience. Local providers have a better understanding of local markets, shipping regulations, and customs clearance processes, which can help you avoid delays and ensure compliance with local laws. They can also offer services like local warehousing and returns management, which can help you provide faster and more efficient service to your customers.\nOptimize your logistics:\nWhen shipping products globally, it’s important to optimize your logistics to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery to your customers. This may involve finding the most cost-effective shipping methods, minimizing transit times, and working with local carriers to reduce shipping costs. It’s also important to consider customs clearance processes and documentation requirements, which can impact delivery times and costs.\nAdapt to local preferences:\nCustomer preferences for packaging, payment methods, and shipping options can vary widely by region. It’s important to adapt your fulfilment strategy to meet local preferences and expectations. For example, some markets may prefer eco-friendly packaging, while others may prefer faster shipping options. It’s also important to offer local currency pricing and payment options that are popular in each market.\nMonitor performance:\nRegularly tracking your fulfilment metrics across different regions can help you identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions about your global fulfilment strategy. Key metrics to track include shipping times, delivery success rates, customs clearance times, and return rates. This data can help you identify trends and areas for improvement, which can ultimately improve your overall customer experience and business success.\nExpanding your e-commerce business globally can be a great opportunity for growth, but it’s important to understand the unique fulfilment challenges that come with it. Sprint Logistics can help expand your business by helping you reach global marketplaces (UK, EU, USA etc). By partnering with Sprint Logistics, understanding local regulations, adapting to local preferences, and monitoring performance, you can create a successful global e-commerce fulfilment strategy that meets the needs of your customers and drives business growth.\nMore from our blog\nBlack Friday Survival Guide for E-Commerce Brands: Key Strategies for Success\nPosted by Sprint LogisticsOctober 2, 2024\nGuide to E-commerce Fulfilment: Why It’s Key to Scaling Your Online Store\nPosted by Sprint LogisticsSeptember 23, 2024\nLET'S DISCUSS NOW\nGet in touch with us\nSEND MESSAGE\nWe respond within 48 hours\nWe answer all email and requests as they come in.
