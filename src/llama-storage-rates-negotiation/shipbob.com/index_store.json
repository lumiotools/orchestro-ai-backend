handling fulfillment in-house.Here are some ideas that can potentially lower your average shipping cost.1.Understand shipping zones\nMany brands pay high shipping fees when they ship to destinations that are far away.Shipping zones are the geographical areas that carriers ship to, spanning from Zone 1 to Zone 8 for domestic shipments in the United States.Zones measure the distance a shipment travels, with the point of origin located in Zone 1.The farther away the shipping destination is, the higher the zone and more expensive and slow it is to ship.If you can eliminate shipping to higher zones, you can save a lot of money over time and benefit from better shipping options with lower rates — more on partnering with companies that have multiple fulfillment centers shortly!2.Weigh your packages and reduce dimensions\nUnless you’re using flat-rate shipping, then shipping heavy items cost more.If you’re printing labels and shipping from home, consider investing in a postage scale to better predict costs and purchase the right shipping labels.In addition to weight, carriers consider dimensions of the package when calculating shipping costs.If you’re using too big of a box for a lightweight item, you will pay more than you should because of the space the package takes up.Larger boxes can lead to larger dimensional weight, which in turn will lead to more expensive shipping costs.To reduce package weight (and ultimately reduce shipping costs), try the following:\nCreate custom packaging with smaller dimensions that are tailored to your product to optimize your dimensional weight (i.e., make it a more snug fit as opposed to having items rattling around in a box, which leads to you essentially paying for air in the box).Use “ships in own container” (SIOC) packaging, meaning your product packaging is what you add a shipping label to, so you don’t add a box on a box.Reuse old boxes.If you’re shipping something to friends or family members, there’s no reason you can’t reuse a sturdy box over again (and packing materials).TLDR: Avoid shipping more air than what is necessary.3.Find discounted supplies\nShipping companies such as USPS, UPS, and FedEx may provide small businesses certain boxes and envelopes for free or at a discount for certain packing supplies.You can also purchase packing supplies like boxes, dunnage, bubble wrap, airfill, and poly mailers in bulk to save money.Don’t let the higher investment upfront scare you off — you won’t run out right away and you’ll also reduce your average per-shipment cost.You may even find some free shipping supplies.4.Get discounted shipping rates\nAll shipping companies have pricing discounts available based on shipping volume, and you don’t have to be shipping hundreds of thousands of orders a month to get these discounts.There’s no harm in attempting to negotiate volume discounts in exchange for loyalty to one shipping carrier.Of course, the more packages you ship, the better rates you can get.Ecommerce store owners should seek lower shipping costs, as long as the service for the lower costs does not affect the shipping solutions or extend delivery times.5.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"KnDHYvi+Y3K+wLAgVUK6tNnybTyOyitIlIDY9m30syI="},"cece2d8a-c755-4404-9e5b-5efdb76ea685":{"id_":"cece2d8a-c755-4404-9e5b-5efdb76ea685","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"c3c35ea0-9cab-4f13-9b24-04c6795d5c60","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"dxbtIp+iAcnAWhZOdZulb2L/zHzOe3leqCRlX0T2Iiw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"76aac42a-e94f-4284-8838-f81c22886333","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"KnDHYvi+Y3K+wLAgVUK6tNnybTyOyitIlIDY9m30syI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"baf60584-e87b-42cd-a985-7a8e5ee9660f","metadata":{},"hash":"i2tDpb0AzR+AcJ4YJ7vTH1bdYt8gmlWpcz69tqXKknU="}},"text":"You

affect the shipping solutions or extend delivery times.5.Check out offers from the platform(s) or marketplace(s) you sell on\nSee if the ecommerce platform your store is powered by or the marketplace you sell on offer any bulk discount shipping services or programs.They may have features that provide real-time carrier rates, shipping apps, built-in features, and integrations with fulfillment software that can provide you with better rates and fulfillment services.6.Insure with third parties\nOne way to save on shipping costs is to cut extra services, which, depending on the value of the product you’re shipping, could be shipping insurance.If you do need shipping insurance for your orders, third-party package insurers are usually cheaper than going with your shipping carrier — in some cases nearly half the price.Of course, this is most applicable to high value items.7.Go prepaid\nPrepaid shipping can get you up to 20% off shipping costs from UPS and FedEx simply by purchasing a certain number of shipping labels upfront.You don’t need to affix them to a box until the individual order needs to go out.This not only saves costs but time as well.Note: This really only works when you consistently ship orders containing the same weight and dimensions or know this information ahead of time to ensure accurate shipping costs.8.Switch from boxes to poly mailers\nIf you sell small, non-fragile products like clothing, shipping orders in a mailer envelope or poly bag can be far more cost-effective than boxes.The dimensions are smaller, taking up less room on a delivery truck, and using them also requires less packing supplies like tape and bubble wrap to save even more money.If your orders contain different combinations of products, consider different sized poly mailers.9.Look into hybrid services\nHybrid shipping services like UPS SurePost and FedEx SmartPost pick up your orders and then work with other carriers like USPS to transport your packages to a sorting facility or post office location, where it is then shipped to a residential area for last-mile delivery.This can cut costs as much as 50% in some cases.However, the tradeoff is often a slower delivery.Note: There are specific volume, weight, and dimension requirements.10.Stay on top of shipping carriers pricing changes\nEvery year, the major shipping carriers increase their shipping rates as part of the annual general rate increase (GRI).These increases vary by carrier, service level, weight, and other variables, but generally equate to about a 5% increase on average (though we’ve seen higher during the pandemic).Additionally, carriers may implement surcharges at various peak times (such as the holidays and Q4 or what we saw happen during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic), when there is a surge in packages being shipped.They also implement other surcharges annually, ranging from large package surcharges to signature required surcharges.Unfortunately, there is no way to reduce shipping costs for these rate increases and surcharges, and you’ll either have to bake them into the shipping fee you charge your customers, eat the costs, or offset them some other way.11.Encourage your customers to place orders early\nDuring peak season or any high volume events or periods for your ecommerce business (e.g., heading into Halloween for brands that sell costumes or Thanksgiving for businesses that sell turkeys), it is wise to over-communicate by when your customers need to place orders online to ensure they get delivered on time.The carriers have their own set of cutoffs for each service during the holidays to help prevent gifts from arriving late.For customers who want to reduce shipping costs, this will involve placing orders at the earliest cutoffs to avoid paying more for expedited shipping.On top of running out of time as dates approach, there may be additional considerations that impact cutoffs, such as labor shortages, weather events that prevent carriers from shipping, shutdowns from COVID outbreaks, federal holidays that close down operations, and other factors.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hluMBODAqi8sk2vo2NYHa86xd0IUUIEEj1IVdhrr68I="},"baf60584-e87b-42cd-a985-7a8e5ee9660f":{"id_":"baf60584-e87b-42cd-a985-7a8e5ee9660f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"c3c35ea0-9cab-4f13-9b24-04c6795d5c60","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"dxbtIp+iAcnAWhZOdZulb2L/zHzOe3leqCRlX0T2Iiw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cece2d8a-c755-4404-9e5b-5efdb76ea685","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"gThoye8RMsGlExZjYh4x7hAdDvYalZc1o/M4IeeXTC0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3837432c-08c1-4421-bdee-867d1fd10322","metadata":{},"hash":"Sy9kgA3nAutNhmL2HdYgSQSShZm2OXY5QZ6L75gIpNM="}},"text":"11.Encourage

but their inventory receiving cutoffs, holiday turnaround times, any SLA extensions, and general holiday schedule.Any logistics company needs to make many strides over the months leading up to the holidays to prepare for peak season, and any brand needs to pay close attention to relay this information to their customers.5 questions that can help save money on shipping\nNot all of the tips above are going to be applicable to your business or improve your bottom line.Thinking about your current ecommerce shipping process, answer the following questions to get an even better sense of what you can do to cut or recover shipping costs.1.How are you charging for shipping?Regardless of how much you’re spending on shipping, the amount you charge customers can also affect your margin.The psychology of online shopping and consumer preferences is fascinating.You can present shoppers with two scenarios where they would pay the same total price, yet they would abandon their cart for the one that has a higher shipping cost.As long as they’re getting a perceived deal or the best value, they are more likely to buy.Customers don’t want to pay for shipping, but it’s a major expense for a small business.Consider the following ideas to implement to make up your shipping costs:\nAdjust the product price to absorb the shipping cost and offer free shipping (only if you sell expensive products).Charge customers a reduced shipping cost while only slightly increasing the product price (e.g., charge customers half the price of shipping but bake the other half into the product price).Offer a flat rate shipping fee to all customers using a blended average shipping cost across all of your orders.Require a minimum amount of money to be spent on your store (that’s greater than the average order value) in exchange for free or fast shipping.Put parameters in place for orders that meet different criteria to more accurately reflect the true cost of shipping (e.g., charge different shipping fees for orders going to different countries, one shipping fee for orders that are over a certain cart value, etc.).Monitor your return rate and revisit your ecommerce returns policy to see if you should make customers responsible for covering return shipping costs.2.Have you tried another carrier?If you have allegiance to one shipper/carrier just because they’re closest to you, it might be worth looking into other options.Depending on the areas you ship to, different carriers may offer cheaper rates than what you’re currently paying.Use the following sites to dig deeper into your specific shipping costs:\nUPS Shipping Calculator\nUSPS Shipping Calculator\nFedEx Shipping Calculator\nDHL Shipping Calculator\n3.Are you using the right packaging?Many small businesses make common packing mistakes that increase their costs, like using too big package dimensions or extra package weight.Others use boxes when they could use a poly mailer or padded envelope to decrease the weight and dimensions.If you use custom branded boxes, inserts, and other fancy packing supplies like shredded paper filler or custom tissue paper, and you are struggling to keep shipping costs down, you could probably save money by ditching those.If you insist on using branded boxes, make sure they don’t have dimensions that fall outside of standard box sizes major carriers use, or you may face additional fees.If your product packaging can be manufactured so it’s ship-ready, you can save on shipping costs by simply slapping a label on it.4.Where are your orders shipping to?Understanding patterns in shipping destinations can help to identify where you should be shipping from.If you’re shipping internationally and it’s costing you a lot of money, you may want to reconsider or instead work with an international fulfillment provider like ShipBob that operates locations across the globe.For domestic orders, you can’t control or always predict shipping destinations, but you can control where you fulfill orders from.Working with a third-party logistics (3PL) company, you can utilize their ecommerce warehouses to store your inventory and ship from locations that are closer to your customers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kNQK7iR4pFaiYIKJMyA2yCX3iocsqPAhXbZAkjuKkok="},"3837432c-08c1-4421-bdee-867d1fd10322":{"id_":"3837432c-08c1-4421-bdee-867d1fd10322","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"c3c35ea0-9cab-4f13-9b24-04c6795d5c60","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"dxbtIp+iAcnAWhZOdZulb2L/zHzOe3leqCRlX0T2Iiw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"baf60584-e87b-42cd-a985-7a8e5ee9660f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"i2tDpb0AzR+AcJ4YJ7vTH1bdYt8gmlWpcz69tqXKknU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a9d8eb08-2085-4ed9-a961-f90123442761","metadata":{},"hash":"lp3uvdN3V9pQ05X/DfEndrAoIkagbYar6XkP5jUejv4="}},"text":"If

third-party logistics (3PL) company, you can utilize their ecommerce warehouses to store your inventory and ship from locations that are closer to your customers.This can significantly reduce your average shipping cost when you multiply out those cost savings across all orders.“We partnered with ShipBob to scale up operations in the US, and we’ve seen a reduction of 70% on shipping costs.Now, we can comfortably assign a shipping cost to each order by pinpointing the product weight and destination zip code.In comparison to shipping products to the US from Canada, which can be extremely variable in cost, fulfillment by ShipBob is much easier to estimate.”Greg MacDonald, CEO & Founder of Bathorium\n5.Have you tried using a shipping or fulfillment partner?Companies like ShipStation and Stamps.com have free trials for small businesses managing shipping themselves.Another big money and time-saver is outsourcing order fulfillment to a 3PL company that stores inventory, packs orders, and ships packages for you.“Last July, Prymal reached $40,000 in revenue.After switching to ShipBob just four months later in November, we are reaching $160,000 a month in revenue — that’s 300% growth.We’re also saving $8,000 per month in fulfillment costs.”Courtney Lee, founder of Prymal\n\nIn addition to obvious direct costs like postage, outsourcing shipping and fulfillment means you have new time to focus on areas of your business that drive sales, unlike packing boxes and running to the post office as orders come in everyday.How outsourcing fulfillment to ShipBob reduces shipping costs\nSometimes, the best way to reduce shipping costs and scale is to partner with a professional fulfillment company.ShipBob provides inventory management, warehousing, and other ecommerce fulfillment services, and also helps brands compete with big retailers.Bulk shipping discounts\nWith thousands of customers, ShipBob is able to negotiate bulk discounts from shipping companies such as UPS, USPS, FedEx, and DHL to provide better rates to customers for expedited shipping, 2-day shipping, international shipping, and other speeds and services.“We were hesitant about leveraging ShipBob’s transportation management system at first – but it’s actually been really great.Before we were manually choosing rates for orders coming out of our warehouse, but now ShipBob’s WMS automatically selects the best delivery method for us so it costs us less and our customers get faster shipping.We’re saving hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, just in postage.When we first got started, we estimated over $400,000 in savings.ShipBob has helped us save 40% on total fulfillment costs.”– Adam LaGesse, Global Warehousing Director at Spikeball \nOptimize fulfillment locations to be closer to your customers\nShipBob helps ecommerce sellers choose the best location in the US to store their inventory closest to the most customers using shipping destinations from their sales history.By cutting down the distance an order has to travel, it can be delivered quicker and at less cost.You can also use multiple ShipBob facilities to efficiently reach even more customers.Free packaging\nWith ShipBob, there are no separate line items for picking, packing, or packaging supplies.We use plain brown boxes and packing materials to not overwhelm your customers with our brand, but let them focus on unboxing your product.Merchants can also send custom branded boxes, poly mailers, and inserts to use for their orders.Offset shipping costs from additional revenue\nWith ShipBob’s 2-Day Express Shipping program that can be enabled for all ecommerce stores, you can meet customer expectations, get more shoppers to complete their purchases, and drive lifelong customers.As a result, ShipBob customers have experienced an 18% reduction in cart abandonment rate and a 24% increase in their average order value.By outsourcing retail fulfillment, you can also get time back to focus on other tasks that drive new customers to your website.“When I was shipping orders myself, what I paid per order is the same price now to pick, pack, and ship orders through ShipBob.It’s even much cheaper to ship to certain countries, which used to take ages and often got lost with localized post here.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"VlsgjcAsV8NRSgrMIH3SV5S0WY2eETU5MCWgZx2pftc="},"a9d8eb08-2085-4ed9-a961-f90123442761":{"id_":"a9d8eb08-2085-4ed9-a961-f90123442761","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"c3c35ea0-9cab-4f13-9b24-04c6795d5c60","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"dxbtIp+iAcnAWhZOdZulb2L/zHzOe3leqCRlX0T2Iiw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3837432c-08c1-4421-bdee-867d1fd10322","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"Sy9kgA3nAutNhmL2HdYgSQSShZm2OXY5QZ6L75gIpNM="}},"text":"Merchants

see how we can help.Request A Fulfillment Quote\nReduce Shipping Costs FAQs\nHow can I negotiate better shipping rates with carriers?One way to negotiate better shipping rates is to consider consolidating your shipping volumes by partnering with a 3PL like ShipBob, which offers aggregated rates due to higher order volumes.Additionally, you can compare carriers and negotiate based on shipping volume, destinations, and package sizes.What is the cheapest shipping method for a small business?The cheapest shipping method for small businesses typically involves using ground shipping services, such as USPS First Class or Priority Mail, which offer cost-effective rates for lighter packages.For heavier shipments, consider flat-rate shipping options.You can also use a 3PL like ShipBob, which can help you access discounted carrier rates due to bulk shipping, further reducing your costs.GET IN TOUCH WITH SHIPBOB\nLooking for a fulfilment solution?Request A Quote\nPicked,

online retailer spends at least 11% of its sales costs on logistics operations.This means, if you sell a product worth $100 then you will need to spend around $11 on its storage and transportation.Countdown to Black Friday\nDays\nHours\nMinutes\n32\nSeconds\nGet Started\nThe good news is that such expenses can be halved, without compromising on customer experience.In order to accomplish this, ecommerce businesses need to invest in improving logistics efficiency by using the right technologies and optimized logistics management processes.Apart from saving on logistics costs, increased efficiency also drastically reduces delivery time, maintains quality control, and delights customers.And this is why optimizing supply chain efficiency is considered a non-negotiable for growing ecommerce retailers.This article will provide more information on logistics efficiency, highlight the challenges faced by online merchants, and how outsourcing these logistics operations to a third party logistics (3PL) company can help build good shipping habits.What is logistics efficiency?Logistics efficiency is a measure of how effectively your business manages its logistics operations.It requires online vendors to closely track and optimize the movement of product shipments to ensure that the customers receive their orders quickly and cost-effectively.Common challenges of logistics\nLogistics is a complex part of supply chain management.New online businesses with ambitions of scaling quickly will inevitably encounter many logistics challenges such as truck breakdowns and fluctuating tariffs.But perhaps the most important, and at times challenging, concerns are as follows:\nRising costs\nEverything from fuel, warehousing, depreciation, insurance, and taxes to manpower expenses related to the transportation and storage of goods are categorized as ecommerce logistics costs.Ever since COVID-19, most of these costs are on the rise, which makes fast and reliable shipping quite expensive.This, in turn, affects your online retail business’ profitability.Smaller merchants who sell low value and heavy and large items face the brunt of this crisis.Customer expectations\nFast and free delivery is now the norm.Most customers expect next-day or same-day delivery.This is a growing customer fulfillment experience expectation set by the likes of Amazon and UPS.To gain a competitive advantage and ensure customer satisfaction, you need to run high-performance shipping logistics operations, backed by a just-in-time strategy.Supply chain visibility\nThe bigger your company gets the more moving pieces there are.Additionally, as your company grows, you’re at a higher risk of logistics issues cropping up.This is especially true if you don’t have end-to-end inventory visibility.To ensure that there are no surprises for you or your customers, it is important to put real-time inventory tracking mechanisms in place.To this end, tech-enabled logistics companies can prove to be really handy.Government regulations\nSMBs have to constantly deal with bureaucratic red tape when it comes to shipping orders between states or even

Friday\nDays\nHours\nMinutes\nSeconds\nGet Started\nThese days, it’s not email copy, website design, or Instagram ads.It’s shipping logistics.70% of shoppers view a clear and easy shipping experience as their top priority when shopping at digitally native brands.But as ecommerce continues to dominate retail, the ability to deliver a memorable brand experience has become a lot more complicated, especially if you’re a direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand.That’s why it’s important to invest in a shipping strategy that meets customer expectations while keeping costs low.This article discusses what shipping logistics entails and how to optimize your shipping strategy for your business.What does shipping logistics mean?Shipping logistics refers to all the inbound and outbound logistics involved in transporting finished goods as they move through your supply chain, from first-mile delivery and drayage to end customer shipments.There are several factors that impact your shipping logistics strategy, including procurement logistics, freight shipping, and carrier partnerships.Where you store your inventory compared to where a bulk of your customers live also plays a major role in shipping operations, especially when it comes to last-mile delivery.What is the difference between shipping and logistics?The key differentiator between shipping and logistics is scope.Shipping is what it sounds like: the physical movement of your goods, for example, from a fulfillment center to your customers.From documentation, working with carriers, tracking, and handling, to delivery times, and transportation, shipping refers to the processes that happens as goods move throughout the supply chain.Logistics refers to systems.They’re all of the synchronized operations that manage how your products are acquired, stored, and transported to their final destinations, of which shipping is just one.Combined, the term “shipping logistics” refers to the stages of an ecommerce supply chain that requires strategy around how to get product from Point A to Point B, whether it’s shipping inventory to a fulfillment center, or shipping orders to customers.State of Ecommerce Fulfillment Report\nLearn how you stack up against thousands of ecommerce brands in our annual report.Get The Report\nTypes of shipping logistics\nOnline retailers commonly underestimate how critical a reliable shipping logistics network is to the success of their operations.For that, you need reliable networks to ensure your products are where they need to be at all stages of your supply chain.For instance, understanding production lead times and working with reliable manufactures and suppliers can ensure that inventory is delivered accurately and on time.While partnering with the right third-parties like a 3PL or major and regional shipping carriers impacts the different types of shipping options you can offer customers and how affordable shipping is.If there’s an issue with an order, a customer also needs to efficiently ship it back, so the returns or exchange process can begin quickly.Shipping logistics can be broken down into three major categories:\nInbound logistics\nOutbound logistics\nReverse logistics\nHere is a breakdown of all three and how they influence your overall logistics operations.Inbound logistics\nInbound logistics are the processes that move products from a manufacturer or other party to be received at a fulfillment center or warehouse.Your inbound logistics network should include everything your business needs to transport, store, and deliver goods including:\nSourcing products\nProduction lead times\nWarehouse receiving\nOutbound logistics\nOutbound logistics, on the other hand, are all the operations necessary to move your products from a fulfillment center or warehouse to your customers, including:\nOrder processing \nPicking and packing\nShipping\nCarrier partnerships\nReverse logistics\nReverse logistics refers to processing customer returns and exchanges.This includes both inbound and outbound processes, like return labels, inspecting returned merchandise, processing refunds, and shipping out a new item if it’s an exchange.Handling these processes in-house quickly becomes a hassle for most retailers.Unlike brick-and-mortar stores, ecommerce usually requires customers to buy a product without ever interacting with it.Over 60% of consumers say they read an online brand’s return policy before clicking “Submit Order,” so it’s wise to invest in processes they can trust.As your business grows, a good reverse logistics process can reduce costs and resources.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6UeE14JdLXftlld+NBcAouTaAI094gfKmMn7798ojXI="},"b55208ee-93ec-4cc8-ad32-6e11d354e2a0":{"id_":"b55208ee-93ec-4cc8-ad32-6e11d354e2a0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/shipping-logistics/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"27a212e1-e573-4b14-9af7-708be12412eb","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/shipping-logistics/"},"hash":"TdImFYsaUf+r2LWnQmKAQRbjlOCmYzUFls25UOb+EZE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e3e449c2-410e-42b4-8649-29717dd52672","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/shipping-logistics/"},"hash":"6UeE14JdLXftlld+NBcAouTaAI094gfKmMn7798ojXI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a8f0fd8d-17d1-4a7b-a96b-43a25c9076e9","metadata":{},"hash":"zT7nwvDjoc6qg5MyFoXGZuMqqYsODojno0NI1wjWsUw="}},"text":"This

resources.The importance of shipping logistics (and its challenges)\nWhen overseeing shipping logistics, common questions you’ll have to answer include:\nHow does your inventory make it safely to a warehouse, and how is it checked in?What processes are triggered when a customer orders something?Who’s in charge of getting the delivery there on time?When a customer wants to return something, how can they?There is a lot to consider when establishing a strong shipping logistics strategy.To make it challenging, the rise of on-demand logistics is influencing a lot of changes within a typical ecommerce supply chain.The markets are dynamic, supply chains have become longer and more complex, and competitors are everywhere.Yet customer expectations remain high.87% say the shipping and delivery experience with an online brand impacts their decision to shop with the brand again.1 in 3 customers will leave negative review via social media about a poor delivery experience with a retailer.That’s why more and more DTC brands are relying on a 3PL that offers logistics operations and premium technology and automation to help support their supply chain.How to optimize your shipping logistics\nIn a global economy of increasing freight costs, disrupted supply chains, and expanding competition, online brands are investing more of their time and energy into increasing operational efficiency.One of the greatest opportunities for growth is in shipping logistics optimization.There are numerous ways to your optimize shipping logistics, especially if you lean on a third-party logistics partner like ShipBob to help.Distribute your inventory\nDistributing your inventory directly impacts your shipping logistics.A distributed inventory model allows you reduce shipping costs and delivery times by storing your products closer to your consumers in more than one fulfillment center.Think about it: 2-day shipping was once only possible by using expedited shipping via air — a big expense!Fortunately, major shipping carriers and other third-party logistics (3PL) companies now have the infrastructure and resources to enable affordable 2-day shipping via ground.With distributed inventory, ground shipping becomes the quickest and most cost-effective mode of transporting shipments to their end destinations.90% of customers say free shipping is their biggest incentive to shop.Ensuring your products are as close as possible to the people who buy them also helps unlock your ability to offer them that highly sought after perk.“We sell flammable goods that need to be shipped via ground, so ShipBob has been a great ally as they have fulfillment centers all over the US, facilitating a 2-3 day delivery time for any customer in the US.This is helpful especially when weather challenges happen; being able to have different locations to ship from allows for a more seamless supply chain.”Andrea Lisbona, Founder & CEO of Touchland\nAutomate your order management and view real-time data\nA robust order management system helps remove bottlenecks for you as your online store grows.This process begins when an order is placed on your site, and ends when the customer receives their delivery.When scaling your business, it’s important to streamline the order management process, along with inventory.Inventory management software allows you to accurately track levels, orders, sales, and shipments.It can also help automate real-time inventory tracking, saving time and preventing common issues like:\nOverstocking and understcoking\nSplitting

reporting, to highly reviewed customer support.“With ShipBob, I can keep customers updated in real time.I just hop into my account, have a look at their order, and see where it is.I’m also able to fully manage my business and logistics on the go.”Lee Nania, Founder of SubSubmarine\nImplement a warehouse management system (WMS)\nManaging a warehouse can be a second full-time business for any brand, large or small.The best 3PLs use a digital warehouse management system (WMS) that connects with their merchant dashboard, allowing you to monitor and control daily operations in their warehouses and provide real-time insights into those operations.If you manage your own warehouse, implementing a robust WMS helps you grow by giving you better order efficiency, reducing inefficiencies that can be a drain on your business.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"45trehPgMdRFUJtziDdRHlrkusutR3TWTRYgJltiKKU="},"a8f0fd8d-17d1-4a7b-a96b-43a25c9076e9":{"id_":"a8f0fd8d-17d1-4a7b-a96b-43a25c9076e9","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/shipping-logistics/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"27a212e1-e573-4b14-9af7-708be12412eb","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/shipping-logistics/"},"hash":"TdImFYsaUf+r2LWnQmKAQRbjlOCmYzUFls25UOb+EZE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b55208ee-93ec-4cc8-ad32-6e11d354e2a0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/shipping-logistics/"},"hash":"zM8jcYvoO7xYxuf7qfJZ3ay/gK99GpjxUC7n/6YELv4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"08de0647-2001-4e17-85f5-1d1041564b7f","metadata":{},"hash":"aXbbwSHCPkeq1p9ufXJ8wd8BFl5QIOapC7BvIgPAxLM="}},"text":"“With

operations.If you manage your own warehouse, implementing a robust WMS helps you grow by giving you better order efficiency, reducing inefficiencies that can be a drain on your business.Unlike on-demand warehousing platforms and many other 3pLs, ShipBob uses proprietary warehouse management software to give you full transparency into your shipping logistics (and some peace of mind).“We are very impressed by ShipBob’s transparency, simplicity, and intuitive dashboard.ShipBob’s front-end software was the primary decision-making factor for me in choosing them over other fulfillment solutions.Their software is so simple and intuitive, especially as so many 3PLs have either bad or no front-facing software, making it impossible to enter orders, keep track of what’s leaving or entering the warehouse.It’s fun to see orders shipping out instantaneously.I love how fast and efficient ShipBob is.Their shipping costs are very reasonable, and their platform makes fulfillment feel so easy.”Harley Abrams, Operations Manager of SuperSpeed Golf, LLC\nChoose the right carrier\nShipping carriers are responsible for transporting goods from a warehouse to your customer.Major US and international shipping carriers include USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DHL.(Note: ShipBob tracks carrier performance of all four, including their average transit times each week.)Different businesses require different shipping capabilities to make sure deliveries are executed smoothly, so it’s difficult for many businesses to choose a carrier.All sorts of things can affect which one is right for the job:\nLocation: Are you shipping locally, across the country, or internationally?Depending on your answer, different carriers offer various services, benefits, and rates.Reputation: Believe it or not, the USPS ranks as the #1 trusted agency in the US (though not number one for all shipping service levels).Customers have preferences on who delivers their packages, and it’s important to consider a carrier’s level of perceived trustworthiness.Where your inventory is stored: If you’re shipping products around the country, you may want to consider a carrier that can pick up products locally from distributed fulfillment centers for fastest possible delivery.2-day shipping options:  One of the most important things to consider when choosing a carrier is transit times.If you need orders out the door and into the customer’s hands fast, then you should partner with a carrier that offers appropriate options.ShipBob removes the stress of dealing with carriers along with the guesswork of knowing who to use when, by choosing the shipping carriers that can best serve your customers, wherever they are.We automate shipping by taking care of the process for you, while also managing carrier relationships on your behalf (and work with everyone from regional carriers, to large international players).“Our focus is to grow our business, and that will not be achieved by packing up orders, sending out boxes, and dealing with enormous carriers like FedEx and UPS ourselves.That’s what ShipBob has mastered.We want to focus on engaging with our customers, building our community, and continually developing new products that keep pace with science and customer needs.ShipBob lets us do just that.”Pablo Gabatto, Business Operations Manager at Ample Foods\nHow to optimize shipping

an order and then sending it to a customer.You will often see shipping and handling as a set of fees incurred on top of the order value and taxes.It covers logistics costs like labor, packing supplies, inventory storage, transportation, and delivery.Shipping vs. handling: what’s the difference?While shipping and handling often get grouped together, individually they refer to two different components of the overall shipping and fulfillment costs associated with delivering an order: shipping is the postage or the cost of the shipping label for the package (unique to the weight, dimensions, destination, and carrier/service used), and handling is the labor needed to pick, pack, and transport the package.Shipping vs. mailing\nIn the simplest form, shipping refers to transporting packages, where mailing is used to send letters and envelopes through the post office.Given the larger nature of packages when shipping, you need to drop the packages off with a carrier or have them picked up from your warehouse; But with mailing, you can slip your paper-based articles in a post box or even in your mailbox for pickup.Most of the time, these services are performed by different carriers; However since mail is dealt with at a federal level, many national post services have both mailing and shipping services available.Here are a few examples illustrating the differences between shipping and mailing:\nYou’d need to ship inventory from your manufacturer to your fulfillment center (likely a freight shipment).You’d need to ship a direct-to-consumer package of a pair of shoes from your fulfillment center to the end customer (likely a parcel shipment).You need to mail a birthday card through your local post (in an envelope with postage).Why you can’t overlook shipping and handling\nShipping and handling should be just as important to you as it is for your customers.Between the costs incurred, your reputation and ability to meet customer expectations, and keeping up with the competition, shipping and handling has a major effect on customer acquisition and loyalty.Top 4 factors that go into forming a shipping and handling strategy\nWith shipping and handling being one of the most important pillars of any ecommerce business, there are many considerations to think through.Getting it wrong can result in abandoned carts, frustrated customers, a drop in sales totals, bad reviews, and lots of dollars lost.Here are the top factors that influence your shipping and handling structure (and pricing).1.Capabilities and resources\nThe size of your business and the resources required and available to you directly affect your shipping and handling cost model.If you choose self-fulfillment and manage shipping and handling yourself, will you run operations out of your home, purchase land, lease a warehouse?Your current order volume, number of SKUs, and growth projections are good places to start.Low order volume will make it cost-effective to keep shipping and handling in-house, as opposed to outsourcing.You likely won’t need a full inventory or warehouse management system to track operations until your business grows to the point where you need to hire people to help pack boxes.A high SKU count may lead to high warehousing and storage costs if you’re not turning products over quickly.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"QGoMMnzZ0NUMQEx6CvkSzvQpiN/ioHPRqDJmK0XDh2I="},"ffe2c52d-f7ba-47d5-a3ca-4689f114cf39":{"id_":"ffe2c52d-f7ba-47d5-a3ca-4689f114cf39","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"93383b09-cc2c-4bea-ba9c-7f532ccfcbd3","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"hash":"aZ2oDYZbhGRVoPhzBRT42YyXeoRyO/IxpBaFyeURqJc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b9a13910-6ef0-440a-b185-0f6cc3274a0a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"hash":"QGoMMnzZ0NUMQEx6CvkSzvQpiN/ioHPRqDJmK0XDh2I="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"501c0b43-e860-4125-bce7-40565cbdbf22","metadata":{},"hash":"MdRFXXj1jDPaLLuAupi2YYeC4HeWnXU5vHKcXLmYQlw="}},"text":"Getting

system to track operations until your business grows to the point where you need to hire people to help pack boxes.A high SKU count may lead to high warehousing and storage costs if you’re not turning products over quickly.Regardless, if your order volume picks up or you’ve reached an inflection point, you’ll need a solution that will scale with you, whether you invest in the infrastructure or outsource shipping and handling.2.Geographic constraints\nUnderstanding where your orders are shipping to can help to identify where you should be shipping from.When you manage shipping and handling yourself, you’re limited to storage and shipping from your location alone.If you expand operations or outsource shipping and handling, you’ll want to carefully position your operations geographically to reduce your average shipping cost and time in transit.The farther the distance or higher the shipping zone a package is sent to, the more expensive postage will be.While it might seem cheaper to pay a couple extra dollars to ship a package than to operate out of multiple locations, that extra postage adds up.If you multiply the cost savings out across all of your orders, it can result in much higher shipping and handling costs for you and your customers.Shipping from a central location or from both coasts can help you more efficiently reach your customers.As your order volume increases and you ship from additional locations in different geographic regions, you can further reduce shipping and handling costs and automatically have orders shipped from the facility that’s closest to the shipping destination.Shipping to shorter distances also allows you to leverage ground shipping rather than more costly air shipping.The same goes for shipping from urban areas rather than less populated rural locations, as your inventory is already near the end customer.Finally, if you have a global customer base, you’ll want to access affordable international shipping rates.You may even consider working with a global fulfillment company like ShipBob with locations across the globe.3.Products sold\nThere are several product attributes that affect your overall inbound and outbound logistics strategy.First, the product itself: Is it HAZMAT, a dangerous good; made-to-order or customized; oversized and/or heavy; fragile; temperature-sensitive or requires refrigeration; etc.?The more special requirements your products have, the stricter you’ll have to be with storage, packaging, and shipping and handling.You may need a more hands-on approach to your entire retail supply chain.Next, how much your product(s) cost to manufacture, how much you charge for each item, and whether items are frequently purchased together will help you shape a shipping and handling strategy.Inexpensive items (e.g., $5) with a shipping and handling charge that costs as much as the product itself may deter people from completing a purchase.If shoppers tend to purchase several items together at once, you may consider bundling products or offering a minimum spend threshold as an incentive to qualify for discounted shipping.Finally, highly seasonal products will lead to very busy months operationally followed by lulls during which little money comes in at all.If your sales cycle fluctuates, leasing a warehouse can lead to cash flow problems and laying off a seasonal workforce.4.Tech stack\nIntegrating your ecommerce platform and any marketplaces you sell on with your shipping and handling solution can streamline and automate shipping and order processing.Based on your sales channels and the shipping and handling solution you use, you may encounter limitations or need to hire developer resources.Some basic functionality should include:\nAlerting shipping and handling teams as soon as an order is placed\nSending tracking info back to the online store to share with customers\nGaining full visibility into inventory levels on hand across shipping locations\nPreventing stockouts by using a reorder point formula\nChallenges to shipping and handling\nShipping and handling is a function that many young businesses spend a lot of time on.However, most ecommerce businesses don’t start their business with thoughts like, “I can’t wait to pack boxes all day!”The reality is many businesses don’t realize the countless hours they spend on shipping and handling.But those who do and see it’s not the best use of their time, often find themselves in the position of wanting to outsource fulfillment.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"khtJg+MWBgo4zhs65TNCnYC7IhHdWiBhOPOEMc1IJUo="},"501c0b43-e860-4125-bce7-40565cbdbf22":{"id_":"501c0b43-e860-4125-bce7-40565cbdbf22","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"93383b09-cc2c-4bea-ba9c-7f532ccfcbd3","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"hash":"aZ2oDYZbhGRVoPhzBRT42YyXeoRyO/IxpBaFyeURqJc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ffe2c52d-f7ba-47d5-a3ca-4689f114cf39","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"hash":"cSFDWT+6JXVAwnqj0BrGXyW84Vo6iB0FFqrOvw2D3BQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"93fb0f4c-3e76-484b-b153-edda89b7e5f6","metadata":{},"hash":"0GT1tTxB6lwH/QEFcwBTlnRqhJK3UPedELi4gGRSyUI="}},"text":"Based

and handling.But those who do and see it’s not the best use of their time, often find themselves in the position of wanting to outsource fulfillment.Partnering with a 3PL is the best way brands stop spending their precious time on shipping and handling (and being glued to the computer every time an order comes in).This eliminates tasks like packing boxes, running to the post office or local UPS store, stepping out to get more packing supplies and printer ink, and looking into carrier issues.Outsourcing shipping and handling also gives brand operators more freedom to take vacations, invest time in finding new customers, offering great customer service, and truly growing their business.The difference between reactive shipping and handling tasks, to proactive growth is the difference between a brand that stays small and one that scales into a more successful operation.3PLs like ShipBob not only perform shipping and handling but provide brands with data and analytics to make more strategy decisions across their sales channels and supply chain with answers to questions like: \nHow many of my orders are fulfilled on time (and what’s the breakdown of orders placed, processed, and shipped)?How many and which orders can’t be fulfilled because of inadequate stock levels?How many days on average does it take for my orders to be delivered?Which shipping methods do my customers choose most often?How much are my customers spending by shipping method?What is my average shipping cost per shipping method?How long does it take my orders to be delivered by shipping method?Which orders haven’t been delivered yet?Which states do I ship the most orders to?How many days do I have left until a SKU will be out of stock?How often is each product sold across channels?If I run a flash sale on my site, how will this affect my available inventory levels?How does product demand compare to previous periods?How are my sales affected by different seasons and months?Which items are not generating sales and incurring high ecommerce warehousing fees?What is my average storage cost per unit?What is the average cart value and shipping cost by shipping method and order?How much money would I save on shipping if I changed the fulfillment center locations my inventory is in?How should I distribute my inventory across ShipBob’s fulfillment network?Where are my customers shipping to most often?How to calculate shipping and handling costs in 4 steps\nThere are many factors that go into calculating shipping costs.In addition to your internal capabilities and resources, geographic constraints, product attributes and requirements, and technology, you need to know your delivery methods, shipping rates, shipping supplies costs (find out more about getting free shipping supplies here) and handling fees to calculate your costs and determine how to charge for shipping.1.Determine your delivery time\nThe delivery methods you offer customers will impact cutoff times, shipping rates, and conversions.Some consumers will inevitably need certain products in their hands faster than others, but it’s still worth testing your offerings — from standard ground services to 2-day delivery to overnight shipping, you may be surprised to learn what resonates with your customer base.Of course, faster delivery methods become more expensive as zones or distances increase.If you’re only shipping from one location, only orders shipped to nearby destinations can be delivered in two days via ground.Orders shipping to farther destinations will have to go out via air shipping to guarantee 2-day delivery.That’s why distributing your inventory and shipping from multiple regions can save you money and meet customer expectations without charging more for expedited shipping.2.Get estimated costs\nShipping for small businesses can be expensive.Minimizing your costs by working with different shipping carriers can help you compare rates for the best value.You may even qualify for greater discounted shipping rates as you ship a higher order volume.USPS, FedEx, and UPS use dimensional weight to calculate shipping charges.You will be charged for whichever is greater: the actual weight of the package or its DIM weight.Shipping carriers also use shipping zones to calculate rates based on where your package is shipped from.So, two different points of origin shipping to the same destination can be shipped to different predetermined zones and be priced differently.3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CN2dsV/2a9A6+HWNbXnGksILYdPphgc4p4t6ar9bALY="},"93fb0f4c-3e76-484b-b153-edda89b7e5f6":{"id_":"93fb0f4c-3e76-484b-b153-edda89b7e5f6","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"93383b09-cc2c-4bea-ba9c-7f532ccfcbd3","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"hash":"aZ2oDYZbhGRVoPhzBRT42YyXeoRyO/IxpBaFyeURqJc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"501c0b43-e860-4125-bce7-40565cbdbf22","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"hash":"MdRFXXj1jDPaLLuAupi2YYeC4HeWnXU5vHKcXLmYQlw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"acb50988-d05f-4dd5-a892-0f83eb224c3b","metadata":{},"hash":"b2xbqbndFY+t3nIqPgkXmAxKM/9PeqLnr0iz2U6R9u4="}},"text":"Orders

your package is shipped from.So, two different points of origin shipping to the same destination can be shipped to different predetermined zones and be priced differently.3.Determine if any shipping costs will be factored into the product cost\nWith so many factors impacting shipping costs, how much you charge for shipping and handling can be very different from what other ecommerce businesses choose to charge.In general, more expensive products can absorb the cost of shipping into the product price if you wish to waive shipping and handling fees for your customers to reduce dropoff.For example, building a $5 shipping cost into a $100+ product may not seem like that much more money for someone who is already willing to pay $100+.However, this strategy doesn’t work as well for cheaper items that compete on price, or extremely heavy items that are generally very expensive to ship.Think about it: If you always get your favorite bottle of shampoo for $5 and you see it offered for $10, you will likely look elsewhere before you even notice that shipping is free delivery is an option.4.Add handling costs\nWhen you receive a fulfillment quotation, the shipping company accounts for handling costs which cover the operations within a fulfillment center.In addition to staff labor, there are indirect costs to support the infrastructure such as shelving units, pallet racks, forklifts, conveyors, warehouse management systems, taxes, utilities, office supplies, benefits, workers’ comp, liability insurance, licences, packing supplies, labels, printers, and more.With so many variables, you may be wondering, “How much should I charge for shipping and handling?”While the exact per-order handling fee can be difficult to calculate, you can create rough estimates by calculating your monthly operational expenses including warehouse labor, rent, and packing supplies.Then, divide this number by your average monthly shipping volume.For example, if your total monthly operational fees come to $5,000 and you ship 1,000 orders per month, your per-order handling cost comes to $5.Of course, this is an oversimplified approach to calculating handling costs but can help you keep tabs on your margin.For example, if a customer spends $50 before fees and taxes, the cost of shipping is $9, and your per-order operational or handling expense is $5, then the total shipping and handling cost for the order is $14, or 28% of the order value.The shipping cost will change based on package weight, shipping carrier, service chosen, and shipping destination, so you may choose to use several figures in these calculations.While it may seem as though you can save money by using in-house fulfillment, the truth is that managing, shipping, and handling yourself, there are many hidden costs, even a certificate of mailing can be over $1 per package shipped,  including your time spent fulfilling orders — a reason many companies choose to outsource shipping and handling.If you work with a third party, you can calculate a similar number by looking at all fulfillment costs and fees including onboarding or implementation, inventory receiving, warehousing, support, pick/pack, kitting, packaging, and shipping.Below is a table of the costs associated with shipping and handling to give you a more clear idea of what costs you can expect and may need to add up to calculate the total shipping and handling cost for an order.Note: If you work with a fulfillment company like ShipBob, there may be fewer line items to add up, as they charge one all-in fulfillment cost that bundles all of these together for a more easy-to-calculate, all-encompassing cost.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hOzUkcUSk0vAlxhy+smgtrdwK7jZLRKhQ6sxpPgFDoA="},"acb50988-d05f-4dd5-a892-0f83eb224c3b":{"id_":"acb50988-d05f-4dd5-a892-0f83eb224c3b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"93383b09-cc2c-4bea-ba9c-7f532ccfcbd3","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"hash":"aZ2oDYZbhGRVoPhzBRT42YyXeoRyO/IxpBaFyeURqJc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"93fb0f4c-3e76-484b-b153-edda89b7e5f6","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"hash":"0GT1tTxB6lwH/QEFcwBTlnRqhJK3UPedELi4gGRSyUI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8059c727-ad50-4695-97aa-6856fe7999e9","metadata":{},"hash":"F5fPqHfXzNdZZ2dV4Qqf3hLqf12KQ+ZVo6Tk29vcGv4="}},"text":"If

other materials needed to warp the box into a ship-ready package\nLabor to pick and pack the order  How much it costs to have the order picked (retrieved from its inventory location) and packed (assembled into a ship-ready package)\nShipping Cost How much it costs to have the carrier transport the package from Point A to Point B (this is also the label that gets generated) \nOverhead (Optional) The indirect costs some companies use in the shipping and handling equation to allocate storage, infrastructure, equipment, hardware, software, printers and ink, label paper, and other supplies that are required to get a package shipped\n3 shipping options that customers expect\nIt’s unsurprising that delivery methods can improve customer loyalty.But if your shipping and handling costs cut into your margins, you’ll struggle to stay profitable.Ecommerce brands must strive to offer attractive shipping options that also make sense for their ecommerce business models.1.Flat rate shipping\nFlat-rate shipping refers to charging the same fixed shipping rate for every order.Most ecommerce platforms let you customize the shipping rate to the country, weight range, or order total to better reflect the actual cost.Flat rate shipping should be the blended average cost across orders.That said, the shipping cost of some orders will not be 100% recovered while others will be overcharged or abandoned altogether due to shipping and handling costs being too high.2.Two-day shipping\nDelivery methods are trending faster and faster.Many online businesses rely on 2-day shipping to keep their customers happy, and some are even moving into same-day delivery.Two-day shipping is achieved by either expedited air shipping, which is needed for packages coming from overseas or the other side of the country, or ground shipping, which is ideal for shipments traveling a shorter distance and is less expensive.Many sellers ship from multiple regions of the country via ground shipping to keep 2-day shipping costs low.How To Save On 2-Day Shipping\n3.Free shipping\nOffering free shipping is an actionable way to reduce shopping cart abandonment.From a seller’s standpoint, it’s achieved profitably a few different ways:\nIncluding the shipping cost in the product price and offering sitewide free shipping\nRequiring a minimum amount of money to be spent (greater than the average order value) in exchange for free shipping\nLoyalty programs and subscriptions that take an annual fee in exchange for free shipping on orders (e.g, Amazon Prime)\nIf you offer free shipping, make sure to promote it everywhere, as this can be a strong marketing tool.However, keep track of any increases in returned items to see whether money is ultimately recovered from the free shipping promotion.Shipping carriers\nIf you’re overseeing shipping and handling for your ecommerce business, you’ll want to have a thorough understanding of how the different carriers charge for each service and delivery method.USPS\nUSPS offers what are often the cheapest prices for ground shipping because they already run local residential routes daily.To calculate USPS shipping costs, choose from their domestic, international, and business calculators here.UPS\nUPS has several shipping services to choose from across a variety of shipping destinations and transit times.Use UPS’s Estimate Shipping Cost calculator to enter details about your shipments and receive accurate pricing.FedEx\nFedEx’s pricing ranges based on delivery speeds.Calculate FedEx shipping costs and transit times by entering package details using their Rate Finder tool.DHL\nDHL is best known for their international shipping capabilities.Calculate export and import rate and transit times by using DHL’s Rate Quote and Transit Time tool.How to outsource your shipping and handling\nYour shipping and handling strategy will change as your business grows.The effort and costs associated with your shipping and handling fee strategy in the early days will be very different from how it’s managed as you scale the number of shipping articles your ecommerce store processes on a weekly basis.That’s why many ecommerce businesses turn to a third party to handle the important facts of your unique shipping preferences.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1lXY8FKWdBd7sNJoOa0K7LDcWqhC1Dh1fYDEGM32I18="},"8059c727-ad50-4695-97aa-6856fe7999e9":{"id_":"8059c727-ad50-4695-97aa-6856fe7999e9","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"93383b09-cc2c-4bea-ba9c-7f532ccfcbd3","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"hash":"aZ2oDYZbhGRVoPhzBRT42YyXeoRyO/IxpBaFyeURqJc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"acb50988-d05f-4dd5-a892-0f83eb224c3b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-handling/"},"hash":"b2xbqbndFY+t3nIqPgkXmAxKM/9PeqLnr0iz2U6R9u4="}},"text":"UPS\nUPS

all three components that make up CIF, up until the point of the shipment arriving at the destination port.At this point, the buyer takes control and handles import fees and customs, and any further transportation costs.What is a shipping and handling fee?A shipping and handling fee is the blended cost to prepare and transport a package.Rather than having separate line items for picking, packing, label generation, fuel charges, packaging materials, and other fees associated with fulfillment, a single shipping and handling fee helps simplify the sum of all parts.How do you calculate shipping and handling fees?Calculating shipping and handling fees involves adding up the labor costs associated with picking, packing, and other actions carried out within a warehouse, as well as the cost of the shipping label (and any surcharges charged by the carrier), the packaging materials used to protect the package, and any other add-ons such as shipping insurance.The most variable cost of all is the shipping cost, which takes several factors into account including weight and dimensions of the package itself, the destination it’s shipping to, and the carrier and services used.GET IN TOUCH WITH

ecommerce shipping\nView More\nSubscribe for More\nRegardless if you’re shipping domestically or internationally, shipping cost is always on top of mind for ecommerce businesses.Countdown to Black Friday\nDays\nHours\nMinutes\n17\nSeconds\nGet Started\nBalancing speed and cost to meet customer expectations can seem like a moving target, so if you’re constantly searching for the best shipping options, you’re not alone!Fortunately, if you’re shipping to businesses, you have an advantage of saving on shipping costs since quantities are often in bulk and speed isn’t usually the top factor.If some or all of your customers are businesses, one solution is to opt for commercial shipping.This article gives you a closer look at commercial shipping, how it works, and some best practices.What is commercial shipping?Commercial shipping, also referred to as “business shipping,” is the process of transporting goods for B2B ecommerce orders to one or more retailers.Commercial shipping also offers cheaper rates than residential shipping since it’s a less complex process for carriers.How does commercial shipping work?Commercial shipping is an ecommerce shipping solution used to send goods to businesses and often involves larger, bulk shipments (including heavy items) at a discounted rate.A business will send out large volumes of items in a single shipment to keep shipping costs lower per item, which makes it a more eco-friendly shipping method than shipping single units at once like most residential shipping.Most commercial shipping involve freight shipping, where goods are loaded into large containers and shipped using one or more modes of transportation.As such, commercial shipping may be carried out through air, land, or sea, and a single commercial shipment may be fulfilled through multiple transportation methods.Omnichannel Logistics Explained\nHow to centralize fulfillment and shipping across channels\nDownload The Guide\nCommercial shipping carriers & rates\nWith goods often shipped in bulk, commercial shipping tends to have lower rates.In fact, leading carriers typically offer commercial or bulk shipping discounts.However, you’ll need to consider factors like carrier, billable weight, delivery destination, package weight, and delivery times when calculating actual shipping costs.Here’s a look at some of the typical rates with carriers like USPS, UPS, and FedEx.Speed UPS FedEx USPS\n1-2 days $53.05 $60.25 $34.35\n3-5 days  $49.15 $44.25 $16.10\n5-7 days $17.13 $17.40 $10.45\nNote: These prices were pulled from each carrier’s website in April 2022 and reflect the average price of a shipment weighing 2 lb and being shipped from AZ to AR in the United States.These rates are not reflective of ShipBob’s shipping rates.To request a B2B and B2C

improve supply chain efficiency.Here are some best practices for commercial shipping.Compare carriers to get the best rate\nDifferent shipping carriers have different prices depending on factors like mail type, package weight and dimensions, and delivery destination.Even just a $1-$2 cost difference can make a huge difference in the long run when it comes to the large shipments involved in commercial shipping.If possible, find a carrier that can provide flat-rate shipping so you can accurately calculate your shipping costs ahead of time.Predictable shipping fees are particularly useful if you plan on offering free ecommerce shipping.Reduce shipping costs\nAs you grow and form new business and commercial partnerships, if you’re dealing with a large volume of orders it’s important to constantly look for opportunities to reduce shipping costs.To do so, be sure to use optimal package dimensions and lightweight (but sturdy) packing materials.To further reduce shipping costs, you might want to consider distributing inventory strategically across locations to store your inventory closer to your business customers.This not only reduces costs but also offers faster receiving timelines.Avoid packaging mistakes\nPacking process mistakes can add up to cost your business, so paying attention to packing processes is essential.Make sure you’re using boxes that fit the item properly so you can keep shipping costs low while ensuring that products are protected in transit.Partner with a 3PL\nThe easiest way to follow all of these best practices is by leaving shipping and fulfillment operations to the experts.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"K9slOrtANvK/p4wB9VUlll4ANDGhnXPTdkCO+LmGjlo="},"71c3e4ea-e16f-4e46-81fa-b2ac1855da40":{"id_":"71c3e4ea-e16f-4e46-81fa-b2ac1855da40","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/commercial-shipping/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"7a544f0d-8713-405a-970c-9d40397f7e2f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/commercial-shipping/"},"hash":"TP1LZ6FRkYxPvroBTu4wTdPhQeiQ3TB2zlj74ZNIGV0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7b8c4667-4bfb-4449-8a8e-7a8c9dc7be81","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/commercial-shipping/"},"hash":"K9slOrtANvK/p4wB9VUlll4ANDGhnXPTdkCO+LmGjlo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"38ca7b04-ae50-4e4b-afcd-39f1a63a41b1","metadata":{},"hash":"PDlDCbcvKgThYjZTNtV4PkQjTIs+CacCW2eAII6rQnA="}},"text":"Predictable

efficiency examples with ShipBob\nView More\nSubscribe for More\nWhen it comes to your ecommerce supply chain, complacency is the enemy of growth.Countdown to Black Friday\nDays\nHours\nMinutes\n52\nSeconds\nGet Started\nNo matter how efficient your supply chain is running, finding ways to improve your supply chain is something you should always be doing.But knowing how to improve and optimize your supply chain can be a challenge — not only for small brands but also for established ecommerce businesses.In this article, you will learn best practices on how to improve supply chain efficiency and how a third-party logistics (3PL) partner like ShipBob can help.What is supply chain efficiency?Supply chain efficiency is a business’s ability to use resources, technology, and expertise in order to minimize logistics costs and maximize profits.The goal of an efficient supply chain is to save money and maximize profits by optimizing the processes and stages in the supply chain.What’s the difference between supply chain efficiency and supply chain effectiveness?Supply chain efficiency is defined as the internal standard of performance of an organization, while supply chain effectiveness is the external standard of performance.In other words, supply chain effectiveness focuses on meeting the demands of groups outside your organization; and supply chain efficiency refers to meeting those demands as quickly and cost-effectively.What is supply chain responsiveness?Supply chain responsiveness refers to the ability to react quickly to sudden changes in the environment that affect your logistics processes.Examples include the ability to scale up when the COVID-19 pandemic hit (i.e., meeting demand for more than double the amount of typical online orders when lockdowns went into place), or getting inventory shipped quickly during the period of time when some of the busiest ports in the world were completely overloaded with container ship congestion.Components of a responsive supply chain\nWhat separates out typical supply chains from responsive supply chains?While you could argue that luck is often on the side of responsive supply chains, there’s a lot more that goes into it behind the scenes, from diversifying suppliers and carriers, to implementing connected technology that enables real-time tracking across the supply chain.Flexibility is at the core of a responsive supply chain, which is not just reacting to changes but being proactive as well.The objectives of a responsive supply chain include:\nMeeting customer demand (delivering on time and at the expected cost)\nBeing able to scale up or down when demand forecasting goes awry\nManaging costs during volatile times\nContinuously improving processes and workflows to fit the current needs and situation\nReducing risk through diversification, planning, and by establishing the right partnerships\nThere are several key stakeholders (and often third-parties) involved in ensuring a responsive supply chain runs smoothly, including:\nYour company leaders\nYour manufacturers and suppliers\nYour fulfillment center(s) and 3PL\nYour technology providers\nYour shipping carriers\nYour customers\nAll of these stakeholders must be responsive communicators, with communication going both ways.Efficient vs responsive supply chain\nSupply chain efficiency is focused on doing more with less, where supply chain responsiveness is focused on agility and keeping business afloat when things don’t go according to plan.But really, supply chain efficiency and supply chain responsiveness work together by managing continuous chaos, as supply chains are some of the most volatile and delicate things in business.At the end of the day, it’s not about having an efficient vs. responsive supply chain but a cohesive supply chain that can move quickly and adapt without losing money.Efficient and responsive supply chains have common metics to monitor, like on-time fulfillment, profit margins, shipping speeds, lead times, and more.Together, they have the same end goal of meeting customer expectations.State of Ecommerce Fulfillment

steps\nWhether you’ve just started your ecommerce business, or it’s already well-established, improving supply chain efficiency can seem like a monumental task.If you don’t know where to start, here are seven steps towards greater supply chain efficiency:\nStep 1: Expand your supply chain visibility\nThe first step in improving supply chain efficiency is to increase your visibility over logistics operations.The best way to do this is to implement inventory management strategies that allow you and your team to track inventory levels as they move through stages, from receiving to warehousing, to being packed, picked, and shipped to customers.A modern inventory management software (IMS) can provide more visibility, as well as the ability to access real-time inventory tracking, so you can avoid stockouts, backorders, and overpaying carrying costs.By implementing an IMS, you’re also given access to data and analytics to help you make informed business decisions, such as inventory forecasting.Step 2: Develop a good relationship with your suppliers\nCommunication with your suppliers is key!When you have a good relationship with your suppliers, you can plan better and avoid any shortages, delays, or issues early on.A dependable supplier is responsible for tracking the work-in-process inventory phase (i.e., the movement of raw materials being processed into finished goods), which impacts the quality of the products you sell and how quickly you can obtain more inventory.Suppliers that are inconsistent in delivering a quality product can slow down your supply from the very beginning, so it’s important to be selective and weed out suppliers that are consistently causing issues or delays to your sourcing.Once you have discovered suppliers that are both responsible and flexible, you’ll need to continually foster those relationships through clear and open communication and conflict resolution.Step 3: Automate your supply chain processes\nFinding ways to automate supply chain processes is one of the best ways to improve efficiency, reduce human error, increase supply chain performance and velocity, and save time and money in the long run.Automating time-consuming tasks, from order processing to automated shipping, doesn’t necessarily replace the need for human effort, but it does help you streamline your operations and increase productivity.Warehouse automation reduces the time, effort, and errors that are common in logistics.Some business owners even employ logistics automation in their own warehouse, using their own technology and tools.However, since automation technology, equipment, and robotics can be costly, many ecommerce businesses rely on a tech-enabled 3PL that have made investments in automation to optimize their supply chain.This way, businesses can invest more in product development, marketing, and other important initiatives.Step 4: Implement supply chain software\nWith so many processes taking place simultaneously across your supply chain, it’s important to use implement the right software and technology that allows your team to work as efficiently as possible.If you manage a warehouse inventory across locations, you might want to consider using a warehouse management system (WMS) that connects with your IMS, which can help you automate order processing, get real-time inventory tracking, order management tools, and data reporting and analytics.Of course, implementing a robust tech stack can become costly.Fortunately, many direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands partner with a 3PL that already has the technology necessary to optimize supply chain efficiency.For instance, ShipBob’s fulfillment centers are powered by a proprietary tech stack, including a WMS that lets you know what’s going on in every fulfillment center you have inventory stored in and where your products are stored at all times.Step 5: Cultivate supply chain experts\nOnce you’ve made the decision to implement all of the changes above, the next step is to create a training plan for your employees.Remember, your supply chain is only as efficient as the people who manage it.Warehouse associates, order fillers, and logistics managers should all be trained on standard operating procedures to provide consistency, efficiency, and accuracy in their decision making.If an employee has been at the company for a long time, be sure to ask for feedback on how your warehouse team can improve operations.If you lack a logistics team, a 3PL can provide the expertise needs to manage your supply chain.Step 6: Establish green initiatives across your supply chain\nGoing green is business value that more customers these days are looking for.Your customers are becoming extremely aware of the steps that companies are taking (or not taking) to reduce their carbon footprint, so it’s important to consider ways to reduce waste.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"bgRCb8kCxvp0l/rpfYqcu7GYxP9vybK5ztiBwuri1xY="},"33601f07-59ce-4f06-94b1-091f46c0b7e0":{"id_":"33601f07-59ce-4f06-94b1-091f46c0b7e0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"949a216f-24dc-453b-9e18-5d42286878e0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"hash":"uem5g4TMViim3uidnuFcc9BxVi5Iu251s6GkdytaeWU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bc364934-0364-4790-baee-970b7582536a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"hash":"i0UFjUuALzUQbBwO0rG8pmw2fiUfvhmM0vjC6xdez3g="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3c6ccd11-86e0-4ab9-b23a-c913e7aa0324","metadata":{},"hash":"ka0KUUzTDUTXalwEMObFmlilG1rA6kng0KdKNRTaQPk="}},"text":"Step

for.Your customers are becoming extremely aware of the steps that companies are taking (or not taking) to reduce their carbon footprint, so it’s important to consider ways to reduce waste.One great cost-effective way is to utilize SIOC packaging whenever possible — which can also reduce shipping costs — or strive for eco-friendly packaging that utilizes biodegradable materials and minimizes waste by cutting back on unnecessary filler materials.If you’re looking to outsource fulfillment, partner with a 3PL that invest in eco-friendly initiatives or allow you to use your own sustainable custom packaging.For example, ShipBob partners with Ecocart so you can purchase carbon credits by allowing your customers to choose (and optionally, pay for) carbon offsets on a per-order basis, and allowing you to offset the carbon impact of product manufacturing and even last-mile delivery.We also partner with experts in eco-friendly shipping and packaging.Step 7: Optimize your supply chain regularly to remain efficient\nImproving your entire supply chain is not a one-time fix.It’s a process that needs to be reviewed and optimized as often as possible.It’s important to continuously collect and analyze warehouse inventory management performance to identify areas of improvement where further efficiency and higher order accuracy can be achieved.This can be done by investing in technology, automating processes, or hiring logistics experts to help.For instance, ShipBob looks at several different aspects of their fulfillment operations to find ways to become more efficient, such as assigning pickers optimized routes, opening more fulfillment center locations to cut down on shipping times, and improving warehouse picking and packing processes.Investing in supply chain efficiency improvements allows ShipBob merchants the ability to provide a better customer experience, save on costs, and spend less time worrying about logistics.4 supply chain management efficiency best practices\nIt’s one thing to make your supply chain more efficient — but keeping it that way is another matter altogether.To maintain an efficient supply chain, here are four supply chain management best practices to consider.1.Implement an effective inventory management process\nKeeping track of your inventory at all stages of your supply chain requires an investment in technology to improve inventory management processes.There are several inventory apps on the market that can you help you: \nOptimize stock control.Avoid inventory stockouts.Set automatic reorder points.Improve demand forecasting.And much more.Many 3PLs like ShipBob offer order fulfillment technology with built-in inventory management tools to help you better manage inventory, as well as offer direct integration with robust inventory management solutions.“We utilize ShipBob’s Inventory API, which allows us to programmatically retrieve real-time data on how many units of each product are currently stored at ShipBob’s warehouses.We currently use this API to generate custom reports to tie this inventory data into our accounting platforms.”Waveform Lighting Team\n2.Use a warehouse management system\nBy using a warehouse management system (WMS), you can manage inventory storage, track inventory in real time, and boost productivity to efficiently fulfill orders.A WMS is designed to monitor the daily operations of your warehouse, so you can decided what areas need improvement, how to save on costs, and how to become more efficient.For instance, ShipBob’s entire fulfillment network is powered by a proprietary WMS, which provides visibility and transparency into performance such as fulfillment speed, orders fulfilled on time, error rates, orders shipped claim-free, and much more.“With ShipBob, you see exactly what is picked.With the new [previous 3PL] fulfillment network, we had to rely on our rep for everything.It doesn’t give you the ability to be self-sufficient.Because of a lack of ownership of the entire fulfillment stack, it’s been difficult to rectify, unlike ShipBob who owns the entire stack: inventory and order management system, warehouse management system, and their fulfillment centers.”Gerard Ecker, Founder & CEO of Ocean & Co.3.Create a returns management system\nImplementing a smooth returns management system is important for two main reasons:\n1) It allows you to keep track of damaged inventory that needs to be returned to the supplier.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tKTmiU1kbpacHYWEfEemiQyJOwR/doP816BfhsVMH6I="},"3c6ccd11-86e0-4ab9-b23a-c913e7aa0324":{"id_":"3c6ccd11-86e0-4ab9-b23a-c913e7aa0324","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"949a216f-24dc-453b-9e18-5d42286878e0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"hash":"uem5g4TMViim3uidnuFcc9BxVi5Iu251s6GkdytaeWU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"33601f07-59ce-4f06-94b1-091f46c0b7e0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"hash":"8CQr7NZcKda7OzyPh5vw7ZTWu90QC35V2ZPq0tUVKiA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a2cf4efa-a59d-4552-a42a-e15f03655cb9","metadata":{},"hash":"UuHTKK2b7gUu3hjJYWl+GAhYYtPDwx1v1BcAnoSUAqw="}},"text":"For

system is important for two main reasons:\n1) It allows you to keep track of damaged inventory that needs to be returned to the supplier.2) It maintains customer satisfaction by making sure that any damaged or wrong products are returned as swiftly, cost effectively, and easily as possible.To preemptively prevent ecommerce returns and to keep returns controllable and to a minimum, try including clear product descriptions, increasing the return time window, conducting regular quality testing, and identifying trends in commonly return items.“Returns were taking a lot of time and resources to process on our end, but ShipBob was super helpful and critical in creating a solution for us.”Nikolai Paloni, Co-Founder of Ombraz Sunglasses\n4.Use real-time data for continuous improvement\nWhen you have access to the right data from an analytics reporting tool, you can make better-informed decisions for supply chain planning.Inventory turnover rate, order accuracy, time to ship, warehouse capacity used, and average cost per unit for storage, fulfillment, and shipment are all critical metrics to track, as they provide insight into which areas of your supply chain are thriving and which require improvement.With ShipBob, you have access to all these distribution metrics and can swiftly identify where, when, and how your orders are being fulfilled across the supply chain.“ShipBob’s analytics tool is really cool.It helps us a lot with planning inventory reorders, seeing when SKUs are going to run out, and we can even set up email notifications so that we’re alerted when a SKU has less than a certain quantity left.There is a lot of value in their technology.”Oded Harth, CEO & Co-Founder of MDacne\nSupply chain efficiency examples with ShipBob\nShipBob is a best-in-class 3PL with the fulfillment infrastructure, technology, support and, expertise to help you optimize supply chain efficiencies, eliminate bottlenecks, and boost the bottom line through cost and time savings.Here are a couple of customer stories from ShipBobdemonstrating how 3PLs can help create a leaner supply chain, from inventory management to warehousing, to fulfillment and shipping.Driving down costs by distributing inventory\nNavigating supply chain efficiency is especially difficult when your business sells to cusotmers all over the country.This was the challenge that Our Place, the viral cookware brand, experienced as they navigated both DTC and B2B markets.To place inventory closer to customers, Our Place decided to split their inventory across 4 of ShipBob’s strategically-placed fulfillment centers.This enabled them to:\nSave $1.5M in outbound freight costs\nCut fulfillment and shipping times in half, from 5 or 6 days to just 2.5 days\nHave 98% of domestic US parcels avoid the highest-cost zones\nPlus, Our Place is now able to manage inventory for both their DTC and B2B through a single platform, making omnichannel fulfillment easier.“Being near our customers wasn’t just essential for delivering an exceptional customer experience; it also significantly boosted our revenue.Our Place’s products are readily gifted, which means that each day we can ship orders before a major holiday translates into over half a million dollars in revenue.Pre-Shipbob, the last day customers could place orders and receive them by Christmas was around the 15th or 16th of December.Now, we can extend that to the 19th or 20th, confident that even with cost-effective ground shipping, we’ll deliver the items in time for the holiday.This extension allows us to capture an additional 4 or 5 days of revenue, totaling over two million dollars.”Ali Shahid, COO of Our Place \nSave time and speed up fulfillment\nAfter growing The Finer Things 1920 from 50

basement.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cr4Ax8WQJMv2zwiy/WNfDqAQz9XNwGjvZYugmM1KJ7I="},"a2cf4efa-a59d-4552-a42a-e15f03655cb9":{"id_":"a2cf4efa-a59d-4552-a42a-e15f03655cb9","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"949a216f-24dc-453b-9e18-5d42286878e0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"hash":"uem5g4TMViim3uidnuFcc9BxVi5Iu251s6GkdytaeWU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3c6ccd11-86e0-4ab9-b23a-c913e7aa0324","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"hash":"ka0KUUzTDUTXalwEMObFmlilG1rA6kng0KdKNRTaQPk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"82f04983-4d92-4ee0-9c88-0adc4b41f227","metadata":{},"hash":"W6sb9f/Rc+kd/GJWcWfpONGV3j9xioMWwH1FIwiXPPo="}},"text":"“Being

minimizing cost while also meeting customer demand.Here are just a few of the most common questions merchants ask about supply chain efficiency.What is an efficient supply chain strategy?Because every business model and supply chain is different, there is no one strategy to build an efficient supply chain.The most efficient supply chain strategies optimize every stage of the supply chain (including warehousing, fulfillment, and shipping) and rely on technology and expertise to deliver time and cost savings.What is the definition of supply chain efficiency?Supply chain efficiency refers to a business’s ability to harness the resources at their disposal in the best way possible, so as to minimize costs and maximize profits.This is different from a supply chain’s “effectiveness,” which refers to a business’s ability to meet the demands of groups outside the organization.How do you measure supply chain efficiency?To measure supply chain efficiency, merchants should track several supply chain metrics that relate to inventory, orders, fulfillment, and shipping.Inventory turnover rate, order accuracy, and average cost per unit for fulfillment and shipping are just a few key metrics to track that can help you find ways to improve your supply chain.How can you improve supply chain efficiency?While there are many ways to improve supply chain efficiency, almost all methods boil down to having the right tech stack — one that offers insights into your inventory data and deploys automation, along with the right logistics team.The combination of technology and expertise can transform your supply chain efficiency into a competitive advantage, and ultimately foster your business’s growth.What is responsiveness in supply chain performance?Supply chain responsiveness is how quickly a business is able to react to sudden changes in the logistics landscape.Think back to when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and demand for certain products quadrupled overnight.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1t1IDdz6KxmjSVT3zAOY0cXuONAGYQbY2kbB9BzI63A="},"82f04983-4d92-4ee0-9c88-0adc4b41f227":{"id_":"82f04983-4d92-4ee0-9c88-0adc4b41f227","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"949a216f-24dc-453b-9e18-5d42286878e0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"hash":"uem5g4TMViim3uidnuFcc9BxVi5Iu251s6GkdytaeWU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a2cf4efa-a59d-4552-a42a-e15f03655cb9","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/blog/supply-chain-efficiency/"},"hash":"UuHTKK2b7gUu3hjJYWl+GAhYYtPDwx1v1BcAnoSUAqw="}},"text":"How

characteristics of a responsive supply chain?All responsive supply chains have a few characteristics in common, including flexibility, diversification, technology adoption, and strong working relationships with their partners and stakeholders.A responsive supply chain also stays focused on meeting customer demand by adapting to the situation at hand.Can supply chains be both efficient and responsive?Yes!While supply chain efficiency is focused on doing more with less, supply chain responsiveness is about agility and keeping business afloat when things don’t go according to plan.However, name a supply chain that isn’t constantly volatile and delicate!Rather than thinking it’s either a supply chain that’s efficient vs. a responsive supply chain, you need both to move quickly and adapt without losing money by focusing on key metics such as on-time fulfillment, profit margins, shipping speeds, lead times, and more.Your supply chain 'easy' button\nWITH SHIPBOB\nOrder

shipping pricing models and shipping methods.Here are the pricing models and calculators for three of the major US carriers that offer shipping services: USPS, FedEx, and UPS.USPS shipping rates and shipping calculator\nUSPS is often the cheapest of the three carriers, especially for ground shipping.Because they run local routes every day, USPS already delivers to your end customer daily and doesn’t have to go out of their way to do so.As of January 2019, USPS merged its two business pricing models (commercial plus and commercial base) into one: commercial pricing.Commercial pricing provides shipping discounts of up to 15% off retail shipping and postage prices.You need to apply for this pricing model through USPS.To calculate USPS shipping costs, check out  their price calculator.Here are some examples:\nMailing your product or products that fit in a 12″ x 12″ x 5-1/2″ box, from Los Angeles to NYC using USPS Priority Mail 2-Day™ Large Flat Rate Box will cost you $22.45 with a normal delivery time.(Updated: on January 21, 2023)\nMailing a 6-pound, 7-ounce package from NYC, to LA using USPS Priority Mail Express 2-Day™ will cost you $94.50 with a normal delivery time.(Updated: on January 21, 2023)\nMailing your product from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Honolulu, Hawaii, using USPS Priority Mail 3-Day™ Small Flat Rate Box will cost you $10.40 with normal

package measurements, shipment type, weight, location, and more.Once these variables are calculated, a carrier will put a price on your shipment.Here are six variables that can affect the cost of shipping for your online store.1.Package dimensions\nAll major carriers use a pricing technique called dimensional weight (also called DIM weight) to calculate shipping rates.Dimensional weight takes into account the size of a package to determine the shipping cost.DIM weight is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height of the package or box size, then dividing by a standard DIM divisor.Shipping carriers like USPS, FedEx, and UPS calculate shipping charges based on whichever is greater: the actual weight of the package or its DIM weight.Whichever is higher becomes the billable weight for which your business will be charged.2.Package weight\nThe package weight is how heavy the item is — no DIM divisor or calculation is necessary.As mentioned above, if this number is higher than the DIM weight, it’ll be used to calculate shipping costs.The heavier and larger the package, the more expensive it will be to ship.3.Shipping destination\nCarriers use shipping zones to calculate shipping rates.Shipping zones measure the distance between a package’s point of origin and its destination.In the US, these can range from Zone 1 to Zone 8.Shipping zones are calculated based on where your package is shipped from.This means that two different points of origin shipping to the same destination may be shipping to completely different zones.As a rule of thumb, the higher the shipping zone, the more expensive a package will be to ship.4.Value of contents shipped\nIf you’re shipping very high-value products, you may want to have your shipments insured.Shipping insurance offers reimbursement to senders whose parcels are lost, stolen, and/or damaged in transit.While useful, this service can add significantly to your shipping cost.This is common for smaller objects like jewelry, artwork, and medical supplies, as well as large items such as industrial equipment.5.Delivery times\nThanks to Amazon Prime, customers expect fast shipping everywhere they shop online.However, if you’re shipping from only one location, fast, premium shipping gets more expensive as zones get higher.For example, 2-day shipping to a customer in Zone 1 can be done through ground

insurance offers reimbursement to senders whose parcels are lost, stolen, and/or damaged in transit.While useful, this service can add significantly to your shipping cost.This is common for smaller objects like jewelry, artwork, and medical supplies, as well as large items such as industrial equipment.5.Delivery times\nThanks to Amazon Prime, customers expect fast shipping everywhere they shop online.However, if you’re shipping from only one location, fast, premium shipping gets more expensive as zones get higher.For example, 2-day shipping to a customer in Zone 1 can be done through ground shipping; 2-day shipping to Zone 8 will require more expensive expedited air shipping.6.Unexpected problems\n\nNo matter how airtight your shipping strategy is, unexpected issues may come up from time to time.These can range from delays in transit, lost or damaged items, to split shipments.While you can never predict exactly what will happen, make sure to leave some wiggle room in your shipping budget in case of an emergency.How much should you charge for shipping?Shipping can be expensive, so ecommerce brands need to be strategic in how they go about charging customers for this line item.Just like calculating shipping costs can be complicated, so can determining how much you’ll charge customers (or justifying how little you’ll charge them).There are several options, ranging from free shipping to charging what the carrier charges you (known as real-time rates), to setting rules based on certain criteria (e.g., depending on the weight and dimensions of the product, the shipping destination or zone, and other attributes).ShipBob surveyed hundreds of ecommerce brands and found in our 2022 State of Ecommerce Fulfillment Data Report that:\n25% always offer site-wide free shipping for domestic orders.24% don’t offer free shipping at all.35% require consumers to spend at least $50 USD to get free shipping.15% require consumers to spend at least $80 USD to get free shipping.28% charge a flat-rate fee.13% charge real-time rates.Since shipping to other countries can be especially expensive, domestic shipping often comes with more incentives than cross-border orders.It’s no surprise that consumers crave free shipping, and this conversion lever can have a major effect on cart abandonment.That’s why many brands implement the following strategies to help offset the absence of a shipping fee:\nIncrease the product price (to pad your margins beyond breaking even).Increase AOV by offering bundles or a minimum spend threshold (that’s at least 10-20% above your AOV).Ultimately, whether you can afford to offer free shipping will depend on:\nThe price of your products (the more expensive they are, the easier this is to do).Your average order value (if customers spend very little per transaction, the shipping cost may be more expensive than your products).Your margins (how much have you padded into your product price to remain profitable).Your average shipping costs (if you do the order volume to justify carrier or 3PL discounts, or whether you distribute inventory to ship closer to more customers).How to determine shipping costs strategically\nOffering your customers great shipping rates is very important in this competitive market.To ensure you’re giving your customers the best possible prices, you need to approach this problem strategically.Decide on a pricing strategy\nThe amount you pay for shipping doesn’t necessarily reflect what you charge customers.It’s often a perception game, where the tradeoff is between more overall sales and revenue, or more profit per order.To recap, you can:\nCharge nothing for shipping (and make sure all website visitors know it) to increase sales and acquire more customers.Charge a flat rate to cover at least some of your shipping costs on most orders.Charge on a case-by-case basis, aiming to pass the shipping cost along to the customer.Be sure to do scenario planning to calculate these nuances based on which pricing strategy you decide.It’s worth noting that:\nMany brands test shipping cost pricing, and try running campaigns to their email database, like “Free shipping when you spend $60” when they typically see people spend $40 per order, for example.This helps shed light on the effect a free shipping promotion has on your order volume (e.g., did you get double the orders than usual?).This is an easy way to start small without having to commit to site-wide free shipping always.Select a carrier & speed\nOf course, some carriers will charge different shipping costs from others, and the faster the service level (e.g., when paying for expedited shipping such as an overnight service), the more expensive it will be.Shipping costs will ultimately come down to the locations you’re shipping from and to, and how fast the order needs to get there.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"P71OuiPKmefX3VjDarzuWQwuzwvIFkCrZJu3cUEY2hA="},"57e74f26-dd3a-4039-aa66-7423305d4fef":{"id_":"57e74f26-dd3a-4039-aa66-7423305d4fef","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/calculate-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6e25f819-09bf-4da7-82ed-b94230b2dbc4","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/calculate-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"tOfd8cSzcx+xFVOUWhJEiVgF6OIRx3Yhl/Gflwl91so="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9405c0d0-0ac4-4c69-8691-a6b34f358c85","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/calculate-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"JRrfZPf+rgJK3qqEmjeYIrHNkNTfny8fvGFjBJipgws="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1fadf4c0-3bf3-4084-8943-a4e2f39e54c7","metadata":{},"hash":"N0gtcbzWuHNCUrMkQCgZJeUAogtWQbe88/+nhMkU/fw="}},"text":"Be

be.Shipping costs will ultimately come down to the locations you’re shipping from and to, and how fast the order needs to get there.To keep shipping costs low for you and your customers, it’s a best practice to use ground shipping and ship from optimal locations that are closer to the majority of customers.Many brands achieve this by outsourcing fulfillment to a 3PL like ShipBob with multiple locations and splitting their inventory across the locations that make the most sense for their customer base (which can surprisingly save brands money in many cases — see a $2 cost-savings per order on fulfillment costs and a 13% cost-savings to a company’s bottom line).Calculate costs for selected carrier & speed\nShipping carriers have shipping cost calculators on their websites.So when in doubt, you can plug in specific information about an order to understand their exact costs and even compare across providers.You can also use shipping integrations on your online store to calculate this automatically for you (from shipping software to outsourced fulfillment providers).Additional charges to add\nWhile the above covers standard orders, to be extra accurate, you may consider adding charges to cover additional costs you may incur, such as:\nPackaging if you pay for this as a separate line item (boxes, mailers, and dunnage) \nSurcharges for shipping heavy or larger items (which carriers charge when packages are extra heavy and large for their employees to ship and handle)\nWhen a signature is required (another fee from carriers when this is needed)\nAdditional insurance if the contents of the package is more valuable than the standard amount a carrier covers \nTo take it a level further, you can also think through not just the shipping cost but some overhead you may want to allocate to find your true cost per order or revenue per unit, such as:\nAny handling charges, like labor and order fulfillment.Your return rate and policy to understand how offering free returns can end up costing you more money (including a second shipping label to send the product back).Your reshipment rate for damages in transit, mispicks, and other order errors since those end up costing you more.Ecommerce shipping cost examples\nYou’ve found a service to ship your product with.That’s great!Now you need to make sure your profit margins can stay high with these costs.The table

business without breaking the bank.Discounted rates\nMany ecommerce businesses don’t ship enough to receive volume discounts directly from the carriers.Because 3PLs manage shipping for hundreds or

Contents\n11 minutes\nWhat are logistics costs?What makes up logistics costs?How logistics drives revenue\n7 tips to reduce logistics costs\n3PLs keep logistics costs in check\nView More\nSubscribe for More\nRunning a successful ecommerce business involves managing a tight budget, yet many businesses unknowingly overspend in many areas.One of the costliest offenders is the supply chain.When there’s pressure to be competitive, offer customers the best service, and provide a memorable experience — all while being profitable — how do you keep logistics costs down, especially as you encounter new challenges as you grow?Improving your bottom line is much easier said than done.Here are some tips on how to save on logistics costs and grow your business.What are logistics costs?Logistics costs are all of the expenses incurred moving product — from sourcing raw materials to delivering customer orders and every step in between.What makes up logistics costs?Logistics costs throughout the retail supply chain are paid to manufacturers, trucking companies, third-party logistics service providers, shipping couriers, freight brokers, and a variety of other vendors.Companies track logistics costs in different ways, some getting as granular as calculating inventory depreciation.What is logistics costing your business?Read on to find out.Transportation and shipping\nTransportation costs are one of the largest buckets within the supply chain and include getting your inventory from the manufacturer to your warehouse and then to your customers.Freight shipping is the transportation of inventory via air, land, or sea that takes place between a freight broker and merchant, often across countries.Transportation costs also include delivering orders to customers at residential addresses via shipping couriers.Warehouse rent\nStarting in 2021, logistics warehouse tenants can expect to see a 10% rate hike due to a high demand for warehouse expansion and construction.Just the cost of renting a warehouse can quickly cut into profit margins.Warehouse expenses can be huge for ecommerce businesses including signing a lease and purchasing land, which are often long-term commitments.You need an ecommerce warehouse that meets your needs and plans for growth in terms of square footage, loading docks to receive and ship inventory, and more.Inventory storage and allocation\nThe cost of just holding or storing inventory can be high, especially if you’re outsourcing inventory storage, as it is a variable cost.The more inventory you have, the more you will pay.Inventory accounting is the tracking and accounting for changes in the value of inventory over time as it relates to manufacturing and costs of goods sold.It aims to help properly value your assets or goods sold and budget for the inventory you need to purchase in the future.That way, you can allocate product efficiently.Supplies and equipment in the warehouse\nIn addition to acquiring a warehouse and your inventory, there are many other supplies needed to manage all of the moving pieces.To make use of the space that holds your inventory, you need proper shelving units and pallet racks.To move the goods in your warehouse, you need forklifts, conveyors, and other equipment.For packaging, you need shipping supplies, boxes, envelopes, tape, dunnage, labels, printers, and other packing materials.To manage the warehouse, you need to pay for technology such as a warehouse management system, internet, taxes, utilities, office supplies, and other administrative expenses.Staff labour\nThe ‘handling’ part of shipping and handling requires people to move inventory and pack boxes in your warehouse.You will also need management, customer service, and other team members performing inbound and outbound logistics tasks based on your business’s unique needs.Expenses in this bucket may also include recruiting and hiring staff labour for both hourly employees and management, determining employee benefits, getting workers’ comp and liability insurance, and managing payroll.How to Choose a Fulfillment Partner for Your Ecommerce Business\nDiscover how to find the best mutual fit for your fulfillment needs.Download The Guide\nHow logistics drives revenue\nMost people think about supply chain management and logistics and as a cost centre, and few recognise it as or execute it appropriately to be a revenue-driver.In addition to reducing logistics costs (more on that below!), there are several ways that logistics systems can actually drive new revenue for your ecommerce business.1.Reduce cart abandonment rate\nCart abandonment is one of the most pressing problems of optimising an online store.Customers now expect low cost or free shipping and will make

to Choose a Fulfillment Partner for Your Ecommerce Business\nDiscover how to find the best mutual fit for your fulfillment needs.Download The Guide\nHow logistics drives revenue\nMost people think about supply chain management and logistics and as a cost centre, and few recognise it as or execute it appropriately to be a revenue-driver.In addition to reducing logistics costs (more on that below!), there are several ways that logistics systems can actually drive new revenue for your ecommerce business.1.Reduce cart abandonment rate\nCart abandonment is one of the most pressing problems of optimising an online store.Customers now expect low cost or free shipping and will make purchase decisions accordingly.Without spending any marketing dollars, you can recover more ecommerce sales simply by offering affordable 2-day shipping.“We understand that whatever Amazon does, we also need to do or we are going to lose business.The cost of offering free 2-day shipping through ShipBob is more than covered and offset by all of the additional orders and revenue we’ve gotten as a result.We’ve seen an 18% reduction in cart abandonment.”Founder of My Calm Blanket\n2.Increase average order value\nHave you ever spent more money online or added an item to your cart to qualify for free shipping?If done right, implementing a minimum spend threshold on your store gets you a higher average order value (AOV), while covering the costs of shipping.Encouraging shoppers to spend more than what your customers typically spend in exchange for free shipping means extra revenue for you.3.Happy customers improve your bottom line\nOffering something for free that is normally a significant portion of a sale might sound counterintuitive but hear us out: Free shipping can not only get more shoppers to complete their purchases and spend more money, but also lead them to becoming lifelong customers.When shoppers know they can count on you to meet their delivery needs and preferences, they will come back.Today, affordable, fast delivery makes customers happy.They turn into repeat buyers, and repeat buyers are a lot freer to acquire than new customers.7 tips to reduce logistics costs\nNow that you understand what logistics costs are and ways to try to offset them, let’s dive into how you can spend less on logistics, whether it’s reducing shipping costs or cutting manufacturing costs and lead times.1.Find a source closer to home\nProduct sourcing is an expensive logistics cost.If you’re importing your products from China because they are cheaper than being made in the US, you may want to look at how much the shipping costs are, especially with tariffs rising.The right manufacturer can cut logistics costs for your business but will depend on the type of products you sell, the supplies needed to create them, the previous experience of the supplier, and much more.2.Consolidate items to optimise purchasing and storage\nEvaluate your SKUs to see if you can optimise the products you offer.The larger the product catalogue you have, the more expensive it will be to store and manage your inventory.Look at your sales data over time to gain insight before you make any decisions.Ask the following questions:\nWhich products are driving revenue (e.g., do 10% of your SKUs make up 90% of your sales?)Which items sell at a faster rate than others and need to be replenished more often?Are there items that aren’t selling much at all (looking at each colour and/or size)?Are certain combinations of items being purchased together often?Which items are driving the most returns?Understanding how your SKUs are performing can help to identify which ones you may want to retire because they’re not selling (which can cause dead stock), where to focus and put more advertising dollars behind, and even if you need to tweak your ecommerce returns policy.3.Review your carrier options\nCouriers update prices annually, so it may be smart to reevaluate prices across their services to understand which options are most cost-effective for your business.Ecommerce shipping costs take many variables into account and can have a huge impact on your overall logistics costs.Review each of the following couriers’ pricing to calculate your potential shipping costs:\nUPS Shipping Calculator\nUSPS Shipping Calculator\nFedEx Shipping Calculator\nDHL Shipping Calculator\n4.Buy bulk packaging\nPackaging may seem like a minor expense, but it adds up over time.Once you know your order weights and dimensions and choose the correct combination of boxes and/or poly mailers, you can get volume discounts from purchasing packaging and packing supplies in bulk.Though there is a higher cost on the front end, it will save you money in the long run when you see a reduction is your average per-order cost.5.Reorganize your operations\n“We’ve always done it that way” is the worst excuse used in business.Review your logistics costs, processes, tools, and metrics often to determine if changes need to be made.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"EDmZ2Beg+Qg7Ov/PUtPzCJ6yg2D/n2i/tWEDUHTHQs8="},"8ee43a9b-24f6-41b8-a3ca-210a9259e861":{"id_":"8ee43a9b-24f6-41b8-a3ca-210a9259e861","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/uk/blog/logistics-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"c849643b-8c6b-4d88-9ce1-554426b3392d","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/uk/blog/logistics-costs/"},"hash":"GxqtxY7b4Au6ucPypRSDI8knpz6T0N7CdQIXb7ch/vo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6bc2d550-1038-46f2-b39e-0f3527c06f87","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/uk/blog/logistics-costs/"},"hash":"lArJS7Q5/CGjnPkewcl1WRB8R8GAqJ2UDEn1A+8F/II="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4c113fcb-1311-4c2d-a65d-36b8e6112210","metadata":{},"hash":"/w0S0PKPhix2SR9er8wXPLZBn8Cc9KGPXkzOa5i/1ec="}},"text":"Ecommerce

that way” is the worst excuse used in business.Review your logistics costs, processes, tools, and metrics often to determine if changes need to be made.Here are a few operational questions to get you thinking:\nDoes your warehouse layout make sense?Are you utilising the space as best you can?Are pick lists for pickers optimised based on nearby inventory used in the consecutive orders they are working on?Are packing stations set up efficiently?Are inventory levels accurate and organised?Is your staff productive and working at a low error rate?How much time does each activity take to be completed in the warehouse?Do you know this at the employee level?What is your average turnaround time from when an order is placed to when it’s shipped out?Are you missing any shipping deadlines?Answers to these questions may help you identify if you need to reorganize pallets, shelves, bins, or racks vertically or horizontally, repurpose staff and help them be more efficient, improve processes that are costing you the most, and even overhaul your operations.6.Distribute inventory across several regions\nShipping zones help determine shipping costs by charging more to ship to distances that are farther away.When you ship from just one location, you ship to customers both near and far.This may seem like another counterintuitive concept, but splitting up inventory in multiple warehouses across the country can actually reduce logistics costs by eliminating the need to ship to the highest, most expensive zones.You can save money by utilising ground shipping rather than air shipping for expedited delivery, using logic to route each order to the facility that has inventory closest to the end customer.Review your order history data and analyse your customers’ postcodes to find common groupings of shipping destinations.From there, you will be able to tell which regions are in the highest zones and costing you the most.For example, if you’re currently shipping exclusively from the East Coast but you have a high concentration of customers on the West Coast, you can eliminate shipping to higher zones by having inventory closer to the West Coast customers.You need the volume to support it though — if you’re only shipping 100 orders per month, it will not be cost-effective for you to store your inventory in more than one fulfilment centre.“Because 17% of our orders are shipped to New York, we are moving next into ShipBob’s Northeast fulfilment centre.This will help reduce the shipping zones, and, as a result, our average time in transit and shipping cost.”Steve Staffan, founder and CEO of Brummell\n7.Switch to a 3PL\nMany ecommerce businesses outsource fulfilment logistics to a third-party logistics (3PL) company for a more cost-effective and time-saving option.“Last July, Prymal reached $40,000 in revenue.After switching to ShipBob just four months later in November, we are reaching $160,000 a month in revenue — that’s 300% growth.We’re also saving $8,000 per month in fulfilment costs.”Courtney Lee, founder of Prymal\nRather than keep this part of the supply chain in-house and invest in a warehouse themselves (as well as a logistics director to run it), many businesses partner with a 3PL that has multiple warehouses.This eliminates logistics costs such as rent, equipment, and labour.3PLs keep logistics costs in check\n3PLs are logistics companies that are specialize in inventory storage, packaging, and shipping.Of course 3PLs charge fulfilment costs, but it is often overall more cost-effective to leverage their scale and resources rather than attempt to do it yourself.Here are a few key ways 3PLs like ShipBob reduce logistics costs.Affordable warehousing costs\nWarehouse space is getting more expensive, and demand for it continues to soar.When you partner with a 3PL, you can store your inventory in parts of their fulfilment centre along with other ecommerce businesses.This way, warehousing costs are spread across many businesses.By only paying for what you use, you don’t have to worry about overpaying for a space that you might never fill out.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nXk/zEUCWST7EBNqGvfFeK4puPtQMOn2JaMqVNFLa3g="},"4c113fcb-1311-4c2d-a65d-36b8e6112210":{"id_":"4c113fcb-1311-4c2d-a65d-36b8e6112210","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/uk/blog/logistics-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"c849643b-8c6b-4d88-9ce1-554426b3392d","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/uk/blog/logistics-costs/"},"hash":"GxqtxY7b4Au6ucPypRSDI8knpz6T0N7CdQIXb7ch/vo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8ee43a9b-24f6-41b8-a3ca-210a9259e861","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/uk/blog/logistics-costs/"},"hash":"j+OMcclfqcscJhHRxHJxdCprImDZVYtSIkk7NwP0l3k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fc61df64-4a1d-46f0-85c4-23986aea3258","metadata":{},"hash":"7gliFtBJwCeXXk3ndr5QKltHGGcslkhGDc8QwHzllsE="}},"text":"This

fulfilment centres to better serve different regions where your customers reside with faster, more affordable shipping.You get the geographic footprint needed to reduce logistics costs that you could never afford on your own.“The more fulfilment centres we have inventory in, the more potential shipping addresses we can offer inexpensive 2-day ground shipping to.And the more people that we offer the benefit of free 2-day shipping to, the more conversions we get.”Founder of My Calm Blanket\nEliminate running a warehouse and operations teams\nWarehouse management is a complex operation, between hiring and training people, purchasing equipment and tools, continuously replenishing supplies, and shipping everything accurately and on time.When you outsource fulfilment, you don’t need to worry about any of that.3PLs are experts in driving efficiencies to reduce logistics costs and avoid delays.Bulk carrier discounts\nWith thousands of customers, 3PLs are able to negotiate bulk discounts from shipping couriers like UPS, USPS, FedEx, and DHL to provide better rates for expedited shipping, 2-day shipping, international shipping, and more.Of course, the more packages you ship, the better rates you can get to further reduce logistics costs.Technology and forecasting\nWith the high volume of orders they ship and their breadth of experience, most 3PLs have best-in-class technology and tools.This includes inventory forecasting so you know when to repurchase product to never run out of stock and also project any changes in demand during seasonal peaks.Inventory management is simplified with a 3PL because they handle the organisation, real-time tracking, and handling of product for you.Additionally, different 3PLs have various tools and integrated systems to handle everything from returns to EDI compliance.Scalability for seamless growth\nEcommerce fulfilment becomes more challenging to manage as your business grows.By outsourcing fulfilment, you can get time back to focus on the tasks that drive new customers to your website and bring in ecommerce sales.You no longer have to complete manual tasks as 3PLs help you automate shipping and logistics processes for everything from ecommerce order tracking to initiating a return, so you don’t have to think about it.ShipBob’s advanced software helps us quickly understand shipping costs and how to improve shipping times by being closer to where our customers are.”Andrea Lisbona, Founder & CEO of Touchland\nSince outsourcing fulfilment to ShipBob, ecommerce businesses have experienced the following:\nSaved 120+ hours per week across 3 employees\nReduced US shipping costs by 70%\n3PLs let businesses focus on higher dollar activities and truly grow due to infrastructure, technology, and scalability improvements.Conclusion\nThere are many hidden logistics costs that can eat up any business’s margin.If you’re looking to keep logistics costs down and want to hand off time-consuming

zones?Shipping zones are the geographical areas that carriers ship to, spanning from Zone 1 to Zone 8 for domestic shipments in the United States.Shipping carriers use shipping zones to measure the distance a package travels – not in miles but rather groupings of zip codes – from the point of origin to the destination.How to calculate shipping zones\nThe location from which an order is shipped is the point of origin and located in Zone 1.The address it’s shipped to is the destination zone.The destination zone number will depend on how far it is from the point of origin, with Zone 8 being the farthest away.Because zones are dynamically calculated based on where your package is shipped from, this could mean that two different points of origin that are shipping to the same destination address could be shipping to completely different zones.For example, if you ship from Los Angeles, California to St.Louis, Missouri, you are shipping to Zone 7.However, if you ship from Dallas, Texas to St.Louis, Missouri, you are shipping to Zone 4.FedEx, UPS, USPS Shipping zones: what are they?To estimate your shipping zones for USPS, UPS, and FedEx, use the table below (updated February 2022):\nShipping Zone Mile Radius (from origin)\nZone 1 (local) 50 mile radius\nZone 2 51 – 150 mile radius\nZone 3 151 – 300 mile radius\nZone 4 301 – 600 mile radius\nZone 5 601 – 1000 mile radius\nZone 6 1001 – 1400 mile radius\nZone 7 1401 – 1800 mile radius\nZone 8 1801+ mile radius\nZone 9 Freely Associated States\nAdditional Resources: \nUSPS Domestic Zone Chart: Navigate to the tab “Get Zone for ZIP Code Pair.”Simply enter the zip code you’re mailing from and the zip code you’re mailing to, and you will get the shipping zone for your destination.UPS Zones and Rates for the 48 Contiguous States: Enter your zip code of origin and download zone charts to Excel.How do shipping zones affect shipping costs?Shipping costs for ecommerce parcels shipped within the US are determined based on two factors: the zone number to which you are shipping, and the weight of the parcel.Below, we break down each of these factors in more detail.Zone number\nShipping carriers use zones to calculate rates for certain services, such as parcel shipments.For services that are zoned, the greater the zone, the greater the cost in most cases.However, there are exceptions.Some carriers or services use a flat rate, letting you pay the same price regardless of the destination (as long as it’s within the United States).For example, USPS breaks down which services are zoned (Priority Mail Express, Priority Mail, USPS Retail Ground, and Bound Printed Matter) and which are not (First-Class Mail, USPS Marketing Mail, Library Mail, and Media Mail).Order Weight\nBesides the carrier and service used, as well as the origin and destination zip codes, exact shipping rates will also depend on order weight and dimensions.With the January 2019 change to zone-based pricing for even lightweight packages sent via USPS First Class Mail, all businesses are affected by distance.However, the heavier a package is, the more dramatic the price increase will be as the zones increase.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZypBXZlRXttlMjvfxIhrBsvL8P8/86TNQkeTXqarV+s="},"e777d716-473b-438e-a550-56061f494b31":{"id_":"e777d716-473b-438e-a550-56061f494b31","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-zones/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"99478c82-4a2f-4e34-b8de-f52128d9ced9","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-zones/"},"hash":"MzqBRFAYtj7+Q9YiM68LQjuzEL+JRyKiZBcuBOah9mE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8d1c789d-5079-4045-87f9-b0b08d49b721","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-zones/"},"hash":"ZypBXZlRXttlMjvfxIhrBsvL8P8/86TNQkeTXqarV+s="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6da44f19-6c62-454f-9c1f-d7aee88f2e91","metadata":{},"hash":"nGPIOVhQ+2LBfm+chooA6Ql0nCGJ6wbVQGNQ0DYE9N8="}},"text":"For

affected by distance.However, the heavier a package is, the more dramatic the price increase will be as the zones increase.Let’s use the chart below as an example.If you are shipping a 1-pound package, the price increase from Zone 1 to Zone 10 is only $3.90.However, if you are shipping a 3-pound package, the price increase from Zone 1 to Zone 10 is $14.65.Essentially, the amounts prices increase from zone to zone are smaller for lighter packages, while the amounts prices increase from zone to zone are larger for heavier packages.Example USPS rates for illustrative purposes\nAs this example demonstrates, both the shipping distance (measured by zones) and the order’s weight work together to impact the final shipping cost.A note on dimensional weight: Shipping carriers use this pricing technique to estimate weight calculated from the length, width, and height of a package, using the longest point on each side.The shipping cost will be based on whichever number is greater: the actual weight of the package or its calculated dimensional weight.How can ecommerce companies afford to offer free shipping?It may seem counterintuitive to offer free shipping when it can be so expensive to send orders to high zones.Ecommerce companies that incorporate free shipping into their pricing strategy must be strategic in their decision to ensure it won’t hurt their margins.Typically, it’s done using one of the following options:\nThey bake the cost of shipping into the product price (using the average shipping cost)\nThey require a minimum dollar amount to be spent (to increase the average order value)\nThey reduce the number of zones they ship to (more on that below)\nHow do shipping zones affect delivery speed?If a package is sent nearby (e.g., Zone 1 or Zone 2), it will almost always arrive in fewer days than a package sent to a higher zone, like 7 or 8.Reducing time in transit is important, because slow shipping can cost you customers.In fact, 73% of shoppers expect affordable, fast deliveries and 24% of customers cancel an order due to slow shipping.[Related infographic: The State of Ecommerce: What You Should Know About Online Shoppers]\nCustomers today believe the maximum amount of time considered acceptable to wait for their order is only 4.1 days (as compared to 5.5 days back in 2012).If all of your inventory is fulfilled from one location – for example, out of New Jersey, as seen in the map below – it can take 5-6 days to deliver an order to a customer in Oregon.Image source: UPS\nTherefore, it’s no surprise that same-day shipping and delivery can only ship to the lowest zone(s).Reduce your shipping zones by distributing inventory\nSince the higher shipping zones involve the highest shipping cost and transit time, is it possible to simply avoid shipping to the highest shipping zones?It is possible — but to do it, you will need to be strategic about where you fulfill your orders from.Where is the best place to fulfill orders to reduce shipping zones?There isn’t one universal “best location” for fulfillment to reduce shipping zones; rather, the best location for your business are those that place your inventory closer to popular order destinations, as determined by analyzing your past order history.A facility close to a large city can help you reach a high volume of people faster, as opposed to shipping from a less densely populated area that can’t efficiently reach as many people.Most of the time, though, an ecommerce business’s customers aren’t all in one city, or even one state, but are geographically dispersed across the country.To avoid being forced to ship to a high zone, many brands split inventory across multiple fulfillment centers that are located in different parts of the US.Cost-savings\nIt may seem counterintuitive that using more fulfillment centers can save money, but there are many instances where it’s effective (most commonly by outsourcing fulfillment, as you won’t have leases, labor, equipment, and other expenses).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2wABqf7D3YIlr+5xzAIyeZAtidM6bTd9jK+42G6zXJI="},"6da44f19-6c62-454f-9c1f-d7aee88f2e91":{"id_":"6da44f19-6c62-454f-9c1f-d7aee88f2e91","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-zones/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"99478c82-4a2f-4e34-b8de-f52128d9ced9","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-zones/"},"hash":"MzqBRFAYtj7+Q9YiM68LQjuzEL+JRyKiZBcuBOah9mE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e777d716-473b-438e-a550-56061f494b31","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-zones/"},"hash":"4Chw9ZQwB8Q3RAle8O6y+YPi3y93O2fTgCcG1bsmNds="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"45364cee-ed7d-4251-9eb0-d9a5e7084182","metadata":{},"hash":"BE3MuzMvs7kbhqgY4D7IbOkPs3iTltiDH6O0c5eYNLE="}},"text":"There

more fulfillment centers can save money, but there are many instances where it’s effective (most commonly by outsourcing fulfillment, as you won’t have leases, labor, equipment, and other expenses).In the maps below, we compare the use of one fulfillment center in the continental United States with three fulfillment centers.The legend shows the color of each shipping zone, with red representing the closest and cheapest zone to ship to.As the zones increase, the colors shift to orange, yellow, green, blue, and even purple.When using one fulfillment center (in Moreno Valley California, as seen on the map to the left), we see one region of the country is shades of red and orange, yet much more is green, blue, and even purple — where the shipping rates will be higher, since it will go to Zone 8.When using three fulfillment centers (in Moreno Valley, California; Dallas, Texas; and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, as seen on the map to the right), there are many more red, orange, yellow, and green areas.We’ve also eliminated the most expensive zones (Zones 7 and 8), leaving only a couple of areas that are in Zone 6.These three fulfillment center locations also provide coverage in highly populated states (e.g., California, Texas, and Pennsylvania), where the green areas are in many large states that have a small population (Montana, Wyoming, etc.).Utilizing three fulfillment centers instead of one would enable more orders to be shipped to lower zones.In other words, the average shipping cost per order would dramatically decrease with the addition of each fulfillment center.Additionally, using multiple fulfillment centers can help you offer two-day shipping via ground in more regions, instead of relying on expensive air shipping.[Related article: 3 Benefits of Using More Than One Fulfillment Center]\nUltimately, the distributed inventory approach can help you eliminate the most expensive shipping zones, lower its average shipping zone number, and save on shipping costs.Some brands have even seen that distributing inventory across several fulfillment centers can reduce fulfillment costs by $2/order and bring a 13% cost savings to their bottom line.But before you commit to distributing your inventory, make sure you do the following:\nAnalyze historical order and zip code data to reevaluate your optimal fulfillment locations.Determine if a more central warehouse location (or even a bi-coastal strategy) would benefit your business if you’re often shipping from one side of the country to the other.Calculate what your shipping costs would be if you went from one fulfillment center to two (or two to three, and so on) by experimenting with different locations, and how those would be offset by the additional transportation and warehousing costs you would incur.Faster deliveries \nIn addition to reduced costs, distributing inventory also helps speed up transit times.While anybody can expedite shipments, the costs are very high, causing a major hit to margins and profitability.If you store inventory closer to customers, it can get to them faster via ground.For example, the zone data below is based on ShipBob’s average standard US ground transit times (across all carriers), updated weekly from January 2020 through December 2021.It demonstrates timelines from click-to-delivery (i.e., when a customer places an order to when it is delivered to the shipping destination), broken out by shipping zones across the United States.The top line (light green) represents the average Zone 8 shipment over time.Unsurprisingly, it is consistently the slowest zone to ship to, ranging from just over 3 days to 7.27 days at the very end of peak season 2020, just before 2021).The bottom line (dark blue) represents the average Zone 1 shipment over time.The average for this more ‘local’ delivery ranged from 1.86 days to 3.66 days at the height of the 2020 holiday season.If we recall the map example, where we used 3 fulfillment centers across different regions of the US, we can eliminate the 3 highest zones (6-8) to see the updated shipping speeds below.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AwbrxCKpD6xFnxYRDba239ZHZYZTuUZAwq0pGmog67g="},"45364cee-ed7d-4251-9eb0-d9a5e7084182":{"id_":"45364cee-ed7d-4251-9eb0-d9a5e7084182","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-zones/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"99478c82-4a2f-4e34-b8de-f52128d9ced9","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-zones/"},"hash":"MzqBRFAYtj7+Q9YiM68LQjuzEL+JRyKiZBcuBOah9mE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6da44f19-6c62-454f-9c1f-d7aee88f2e91","metadata":{"url":"https://www.shipbob.com/ecommerce-shipping/shipping-zones/"},"hash":"nGPIOVhQ+2LBfm+chooA6Ql0nCGJ6wbVQGNQ0DYE9N8="}},"text":"It

and logistics industries, the best 3PLs can help your business implement best practices in your shipping strategy to navigate shipping zones, minimize costs, and maximize efficiency.Here are just a few of the benefits of partnering with a 3PL for your fulfillment and shipping.Distribute inventory across a broad fulfillment network\nThe best 3PLs will have a number of fulfillment centers across the US — and even abroad — in which they store inventory and fulfill orders for their customers.This enables ecommerce business to reap all the benefits of distributed inventory (namely, cost savings and reduced transit times) without having to invest enormous amounts of capital they don’t have in establishing their own facilities.Offers faster shipping times\nApart from the faster shipping times that distributing inventory provides, 3PLs can also shorten delivery times in other ways.The right logistics partner will process and fulfill orders more efficiently than a business self-fulfilling its orders, which gets orders out for shipping faster and reduces lead time.Some 3Pls may even have expedited shipping programs available, so that ecommerce businesses can offer their customers 2-day shipping wherever they are.Reduce shipping costs\nIn addition to lowering average shipping cost through distributed inventory, some 3PLs will also negotiate bulk shipping discounts with major carriers.Ecommerce businesses can then choose whether or not to pass the savings onto their customers.Maintain higher customer satisfaction\nCustomers want fast shipping at an affordable price.By providing avenues to 2-day shipping and minimal shipping costs, 3PLs help ecommerce businesses satisfy shoppers’ expectations to build loyalty and win new business.Conclusion\nIf you understand zone shipping, you can adjust your ecommerce fulfillment strategy to better meet customer expectations around speedy and affordable deliveries.Not only will this help you improve efficiency by reducing distance and time in transit, but it can also help you reduce shipping costs, generate more sales, and improve your bottom line.To keep fulfillment costs and overall logistics costs down, you must effectively use zone shipping to your advantage.Learn how ShipBob helps ecommerce businesses do this by fulfilling orders from their network of fulfillment centers in the largest US cities to effectively reach customers.GET IN TOUCH WITH SHIPBOB\nLooking for a fulfilment solution?Request A Quote\nPicked, packed, and shipped.© Copyright ShipBob, Inc.
