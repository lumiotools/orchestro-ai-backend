unusually high, sigh in resignation, and continue putting items in their cart.The shopper has several options for finding better prices.They could try a different store to see if prices are lower, or they might find some coupons.Even buying in bulk could save money in the long run.Instead, they continue paying the high prices for their grocery haul.Seems strange, right?But that’s the approach some ecommerce stores take when it comes to shipping.Even if rates seem high, they just keep buying labels, not realizing that they have other options.If you’re feeling stuck with too-high shipping rates, you’ve come to the right place.This article, based on a recent webinar\nopen_in_new\n with EasyPost and Flexport, will outline some key strategies for decreasing your shipping costs.But first, a quick introduction to shipping rate management:\nWhat is shipping rate management, and why does it matter?Shipping rate management is the process of negotiating and optimizing shipping rates.The goal of rate management is to balance cost and service quality; while you obviously want to save as much money as possible on shipping, savings shouldn’t come at the expense of on-time delivery.Rate management is crucial because last-mile shipping, the final step in the fulfillment process, makes up a disproportionate amount of your total shipping costs.When you transport a load of products to your warehouse as freight, each item may only cost cents to move.On the other hand, shipping a single item to a customer can cost several dollars.By focusing on rate management, you can reduce last-mile delivery expenses and improve the customer experience.How to get the best rates\nDuring the webinar, co-hosts Lori and Jason discussed several ways to level up your rate management strategy.We’ll review three ideas: building relationships with carriers, using your shipping data as leverage, and relying on technology.Build strong relationships with carriers\nThe logistics industry is heavily relationship-driven, and communicating regularly with carrier representatives can help you access better rates and service.Have weekly conversations.Start by scheduling weekly meetings with your carrier representative to review costs and performance.Talk about key metrics such as on-time deliveries, data flow, and service quality, as well as issues like lost or damaged packages.Hold quarterly business reviews (QBRs).Conduct regular QBRs with members of your leadership team and carrier representatives to align on goals.Use shipping data during negotiations\nNegotiating shipping rates can be intimidating!These tips will help you present your case clearly and persuasively.Share key data.Come to negotiations with your shipping data.This includes information on packages shipped, delivery times, volume, shipping lanes, service levels, and carrier performance.Be transparent about your goals.Remember, this isn’t all about you—negotiation is all about finding a win-win scenario.Be open about your target rates and goals to find realistic solutions that benefit both you and the carrier.Leverage technology\nFor many businesses, negotiating with carriers is time-consuming and expensive.Others simply don’t have high enough shipping volumes to negotiate better rates.If these challenges sound familiar, consider using multi-carrier shipping technology.Shipping systems like EasyPost integrate with multiple carriers, provide access to volume discounts, and automatically select the best shipping method for each package.See how EasyPost helps with rate management.Get more tips for cost-effective shipping …Get more tips for cost-effective shipping by watching our webinar, “Mastering the Shipping Rates Battle:

an internal metric you can use to determine if you are using all of your resources to their full potential and saving in every way you can.Keeping that in mind, as you read through this article be on the lookout to find areas to improve in your current logistics processes.1.Use the right software for the job\nOften, I have found businesses using some software simply because the owner or manager was familiar with it.While this has benefits, the drawbacks can often drag you down without notice.Even within the same industry, businesses can have drastically different processes for accomplishing the same task.Without thoroughly comparing additional software to your processes, you could be losing money through inefficient processes.As an example, in warehouses that do picking and packing, the software could be using an inefficient pick flow.This means warehouse workers could be losing time, and over the long run, costing you lots of money.Processes are just the tip of the iceberg.If you aren’t utilizing the proper software to manage your shipping, you could be losing tens of thousands of dollars every month, depending on your volume.2.Not hiring the right people\nAs a business owner, I know the urge to save a dollar here and there can be very enticing.And in some of those cases, justified.However, when it comes to logistics, you don't know what you don't know.The problem is the things you don't know in logistics can cost you – big time.Not everyone in your company needs to be an expert in logistics, but having at least one person who has been there and done that can save you bundles of money on the back end.A seasoned professional who can accomplish something like negotiating an extra 2% discount on your shipping can have a drastic impact on your business over a year.3.Get creative and negotiate\nHaving consulted for several logistics companies, the first thing I notice is that people are often all too willing to accept the first price a supplier offers.This is one of my favorite areas to exercise my creativity.I will do everything from asking for discounts to free equipment in exchange for minimum volumes on expendables.For instance, you might be able to find a supplier willing to loan you an automatic tape dispenser if you order a certain amount of tape.I have worked in warehouses where they were given free box-making machines (valued over $1M) simply by ordering enough corrugated cardboard.It never hurts to ask for discounts or creative solutions that can be a win-win when it comes to suppliers.4.Constantly review everything, and if it’s not working, find a new solution\nAnother area I see companies fail is reviews.It’s easy to get bogged down in the day-to-day operations and let things slide.I get it.The number of times I’ve heard, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” is crazy.This attitude could be costing your company untold amounts of money every year.Many vendors base pricing on volume.Has your usage of paper doubled?If so, it’s a good time to call your vendor to renegotiate.Even if you’re in the middle of a contract, I’ve found that it can sometimes be cheaper to break your contract and get a new supplier at heavier discounts.I had never seen a vendor who wasn’t willing to work with me when approached correctly.This goes for internal processes as well.Don’t let the excuse of having always done something one way prevent you from finding a better solution.For example, is your dock always backed up during receiving days?Reevaluate and find a better practice.Saving a few man-hours every week can add up at the end of the year.I find it an excellent practice to reevaluate most processes and expenditures quarterly to even monthly, depending on how quickly a business is growing.Ultimately, don’t be afraid to switch things up to improve things for your company.5.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6iTQiHceSa5Zt+kgrnWD8zoxJh+KNtsdWsxYXdalKxw="},"f0de7b99-1630-4605-b013-ec76415cad03":{"id_":"f0de7b99-1630-4605-b013-ec76415cad03","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-03-14-improving-your-logistics-efficiency-in-7-easy-steps"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"af0d8f9b-b0c1-463f-acd1-07d8bd5fa1ca","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-03-14-improving-your-logistics-efficiency-in-7-easy-steps"},"hash":"jmHWN1nBngVeIMTPRBRFO99JKorUooiBIkAQi+6Gj60="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a65343d9-3e82-4fd0-aae5-622f70f7984c","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-03-14-improving-your-logistics-efficiency-in-7-easy-steps"},"hash":"6iTQiHceSa5Zt+kgrnWD8zoxJh+KNtsdWsxYXdalKxw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5ff791ab-67f8-40ac-80e3-f43fca239eb3","metadata":{},"hash":"orYqgFgeI2mZMc0Yny9iYF43ERTQ+mPEvugktpqlof0="}},"text":"Many

on how quickly a business is growing.Ultimately, don’t be afraid to switch things up to improve things for your company.5.Communicate, communicate, communicate\nWithout a doubt, the number one reason I see businesses fail is the lack of cross-departmental communication and sandboxing.If you're not familiar with sandboxing, it's the act of one department not letting anyone from other departments know what they are doing.Effective communication is critical to the success of any logistics environment.For example, if a warehouse knows a potential issue could impact operations or a client, they need to notify all parties involved immediately.Often, issues that start in one department can have a far-reaching impact across multiple departments.Therefore, you have to foster and have a structured system of communication.It's a must in today's logistics environment.Things move too quickly to not keep everyone in the loop.6.Constantly train and hold employees accountable\nTraining is often one of the most overlooked aspects of any logistics process improvement plan.Unfortunately, it’s surprisingly common for a business to hire someone, train them for a day (if that), and never train them again unless there is an incident.Often I find employees will begin to take shortcuts or find ways to work around processes.Sometimes these can be of great value to learn from and teach other employees.Other times, many of these workarounds can be detrimental in ways that they may not realize.Be sure to provide follow-up training as frequently as reasonably possible.Some of the most well-run organizations I have worked with provide quarterly training check-ins.These don’t need to be super detailed – a quick run-through is usually all that is required.Most critical of all is to have your employee verify (either verbally or in writing) that they understand the training and stay within the operating procedures.7.Outsource everything you can (at least that which makes sense to)\nEvery company has those things that they cling to.Something that they know they probably shouldn’t, but still do anyway.This can be everything from taking propane cylinders to getting re-filled to managing your books.These things make us feel more connected to our business but, in reality, are pulling us away from the things that make us money.So, in most cases, when I run through the numbers, I can usually find an option as cost-effective or cheaper when comparing apples to apples.This means that you and your employees can focus on the critical components of running your logistics operations.Imagine what you could accomplish with even just a few more hours back every week: inventory audits, reorganization, training, and more.Focus on the things that make your business money and run smoother.Get out of the weeds.Previous Post:\nFinding Cost Savings with Data Visibility...Next Post:\nTransit Time Meaning and Why It Matters...Blog Archive\n2024\n2023\n2022\nHow to Calculate

Master and Optimize Your Shipping Process\nFebruary 22, 2024\nby Jaidyn Farar\nTweet\nShare\nAs an organization grows, its shipping process evolves.But whether you’re just starting your business or already managing a large team of logistics professionals, you have many of the same questions and concerns.How can I ship as quickly and affordably as possible?What parts of my shipping process can I automate?Will the supply chain investments I make pay off?To answer these questions, you need to take a close look at every step in the shipping process.In this article, we’ll explain how the shipping process works, who’s involved, and what you can do to optimize it.What is the shipping process?The shipping process encompasses all the steps involved in moving goods from your business to end consumers.It includes order processing, picking and packing, carrier selection, last-mile delivery, reverse logistics, and even customer service.Regardless of size, every ecommerce business needs to master shipping if they want to survive in a competitive market.By optimizing each step of the process, you’ll enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the customer experience.The main steps of the shipping process\nSince the birth of ecommerce\nopen_in_new\n in the late 1990s, organizations have refined and drastically improved their shipping performance.Today, most businesses are keeping customers happy: In one survey, 77% of online shoppers\nopen_in_new\n rated their deliveries over the past six months at least an eight out of 10.Still, you can always improve!When you understand everything that goes into the shipping process, you’ll be better able to make tweaks and adjustments that will push your customer satisfaction to 10 out of 10.We’ve broken the shipping process into 3 main phases: pre-shipping, shipping, and post-shipping.Pre-shipping\nBefore shipping anything, you need to have inventory available to meet customer demand.If a product is marked out of stock on your website, you could lose sales; 59% of consumers\nopen_in_new\n say that products being in stock and ready to ship influences their decision to shop from a retailer.Optimization tip: Track stock levels with an inventory management system.For full inventory visibility, an inventory management system is an essential part of your logistics tech stack.As customers make purchases on your ecommerce platform, you’ll receive their order information in your order management system (OMS).These systems should be able to send and receive data in real time—if that doesn’t happen, you’ll face a ripple effect of delays that impact every element of your shipping process.Optimization tip: Make sure every system is seamlessly integrated.Your ecommerce platform, order management system (OMS), warehouse management system, inventory management system, shipping software, and other logistics technology should be able to pass data back and forth automatically.With full integration, the shipping process will run smoothly from start to finish.Shipping\nThis stage of the shipping process has the largest impact on the overall delivery experience, so it’s important to get it right.We’ll break it down into six smaller steps.Step 1: Gather information and documentation\nAs you know, shipping isn’t just about putting products into boxes.It all starts with collecting essential information.If you’re shipping internationally, you’ll need to fill out the appropriate customs forms, and regardless of your customers’ locations, you’ll need at least one crucial piece of information: their address.Optimization tip: Verify addresses automatically to avoid errors.Incorrect addresses can cause packages to get stuck in shipping limbo.To keep things on track, verify customer addresses for accuracy using address verification software, which automatically detects errors and typos when shoppers enter their addresses online.Step 2: Pick the product(s)\nIf your warehouse is organized with efficiency in mind, the picking process should be a breeze!As workers apply systematic approaches like zone or wave picking, they’ll be able to gather items for orders quickly, with minimal walking time.To take things a step further, turn to technology.Optimization tip: Automate your warehouses.In addition to using efficient picking strategies, consider automating your warehouses with software, robotics, and machinery.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"LtxRt0Wsh5ofo3+Mnn8PhzSCNbrkKFZTTzN94vTv5Nk="},"65d52498-ec5c-4f3a-aa29-8d9a327f0573":{"id_":"65d52498-ec5c-4f3a-aa29-8d9a327f0573","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9986b3fd-76ae-4cdf-b72e-1b361a03643b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"hash":"VRd1p6M+++bW6ut2odRJvKx3oiynCM594emWpmMb8Ac="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"785d8079-201a-4208-9009-240ed4249046","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"hash":"LtxRt0Wsh5ofo3+Mnn8PhzSCNbrkKFZTTzN94vTv5Nk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3265cc3c-1ee7-4942-a66a-65f2212cad8f","metadata":{},"hash":"limOhvY5p1I93Csj0YXEMMxRmuQ2F0jKNJLpwxlHKxc="}},"text":"It

items for orders quickly, with minimal walking time.To take things a step further, turn to technology.Optimization tip: Automate your warehouses.In addition to using efficient picking strategies, consider automating your warehouses with software, robotics, and machinery.Relying on your warehouse management system (WMS) or pick and pack software to show you the most efficient picking and packing methods is an excellent start.Eventually, adding things like automated guided vehicles (AGVs), conveyor systems, and robotic arms will revolutionize your picking, packing, and sorting.Kim Baudry, market development director at Dematic, explains that automating your warehouse has long-term benefits that shouldn’t be overlooked.“When you use automation, especially when you can store products in smaller spaces—and pick and pack in smaller spaces—you can actually shrink the size of a distribution center significantly.”The result?Money saved on labor, electricity, and warehouse space—not to mention more sustainable operations.Step 3: Pack the products(s)\nPacking is most effective if you have standard processes in place for choosing packaging sizes, adding filler material, adding appropriate labels (like “Fragile”), and securely packing boxes.Optimization tip: Minimize waste.Packaging can get costly, driving up total shipping costs.Reviewing your packaging materials and processes can help you save money.Choose packaging that fits your products snugly to avoid unnecessary dimensional weight charges, and consider lightweight (but durable) packaging options.In addition to saving money and preventing package damage, more efficient packaging has a positive environmental impact.When your business incorporates sustainable practices, it’s more appealing to eco-conscious customers, many of whom look for sustainable delivery options.Step 4: Choose your carrier and shipping method\nEven experienced shippers struggle to choose the right carriers and shipping methods.As you evaluate carriers, examine factors like shipping rates, delivery speed, and reliability.Keep in mind that large carriers are often known for their speed and reliability, while smaller ones offer cost-effective ways to ship to specific areas.Once you’ve chosen a carrier, you need to choose a shipping service.The most effective shipping method will depend on package size and weight, destination, and desired delivery speed.If you’re shipping a restricted item, such as alcohol, that will factor into the service you use as well.Just make sure to tailor your shipping methods to meet customer expectations.Offer choices like standard, expedited, and express shipping, keeping in mind that 29% of consumers\nopen_in_new\n have abandoned an order because it wouldn’t arrive by the time they needed it.Optimization tip: Streamline multi-carrier shipping with technology.Shipping software like EasyPost Enterprise simplifies this step of the shipping process by automatically integrating with an extensive carrier library, generating the best carrier options and shipping methods based on delivery specifications, and automatically creating shipping labels.Step 5: Hand packages over to the carrier\nOnce you've meticulously picked and packed products, the final step is handing packages over to your carrier(s) of choice.You can ensure a smooth transition by coordinating with your carrier's logistics team to schedule pickups or drop-offs.For best results, clearly communicate shipping details, including package weight, dimensions, and any specific handling instructions.Step 6: Provide customers with tracking information and estimated delivery times\nYour role in the shipping process doesn’t end once you’ve passed packages to carriers.To help customers monitor the status and location of their shipments, use a robust tracking system and clearly communicate estimated delivery windows.Rather than sending customers to a carrier’s tracking platform, consider creating a custom tracking portal to give your customers a more cohesive experience with your brand.Optimization tip: Use tracking data to improve shipping performance.Accurate package tracking will reduce customer questions and concerns, but it will also give your logistics and customer service teams the information they need to address issues that arise.If you notice common problems with specific carriers (like frequent package damage), you’ll have hard evidence when it comes time to address the issue.Post-shipping\nOnce parcels are on the road, your focus shifts to resolving potential problems.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"FKl/zs4WdhCko8VGCeB5UEs8kAPuMPh4QOMAOor/av8="},"3265cc3c-1ee7-4942-a66a-65f2212cad8f":{"id_":"3265cc3c-1ee7-4942-a66a-65f2212cad8f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9986b3fd-76ae-4cdf-b72e-1b361a03643b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"hash":"VRd1p6M+++bW6ut2odRJvKx3oiynCM594emWpmMb8Ac="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"65d52498-ec5c-4f3a-aa29-8d9a327f0573","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"hash":"zYHFFr9DBBN7QL5luHOcfs8ZeI0UTtaEu2OB9WXa5WU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1bc6649c-5bdd-4779-bf37-db94cef42913","metadata":{},"hash":"VqcHMS+Q8LX1oJHiWDkpdhzPgkCwBt0lwzG3ciaLGos="}},"text":"For

prepared for all of them:\nReturn requests\nPackage damage\nLost orders\nPorch piracy\nopen_in_new\n (package theft)\nOther customer complaints\nWhen customers bring problems to your attention, address their concerns.By resolving shipping issues promptly, you’ll bolster trust, minimize disruptions, and give customers the confidence to buy from you again.Optimization tip: Make returns a breeze.Include prepaid return labels with every order to boost customer satisfaction.You can either print and pack labels with original shipments or provide a QR code via email.Who participates in the shipping process?The shipping process involves three main participants: the shipper, carriers, and outsourced logistics companies (3PL or 4PL).As each of these participants coordinate and work together, the shipping process will run smoothly.Let’s review what you can do to build solid relationships with other organizations that are involved in your shipping process.Shippers\nThe shipper is the entity that processes orders and prepares them for shipping.Unless you use a 3PL, you’re the shipper!As a shipper, you make many crucial decisions: choosing carriers, negotiating rates, and implementing strategies to make sure the shipping journey aligns with customer expectations.Your most important goal?Keep customers happy by offering affordable shipping costs and flexible delivery options.Your in-house logistics team is the single most important driver of improvements to the shipping process—regardless of how your other partners perform.Depending on the fulfillment channels you use, you’ll need to adjust your shipping strategy.Fulfilling orders from a brick-and-mortar store\nIf you use an omnichannel fulfillment\nopen_in_new\n strategy, your brick-and-mortar locations aren’t just where customers come to shop in-person.They also act as miniature distribution centers, where online orders are picked, packed, shipped, and returned.In order for goods and information to flow smoothly across all your sales channels, all your technology must be integrated.Inventory visibility is especially essential, as it ensures that you have enough stock to fulfill online orders and meet the demand of in-person shoppers.Optimization tip: Bring in omnichannel fulfillment experts.Supply chain consultants can jumpstart (or improve) your omnichannel operations.Work with an organization like Summit Advisory Team to access several decades worth of expertise in omnichannel logistics.Fulfilling orders from a warehouse or distribution center \nAs a shipper, your warehouses and distribution centers are some of your most valuable assets.When these facilities are well-organized, with modern technology in place, you’ll see shipping efficiency and accuracy skyrocket.Optimization tip: Invest in scalable infrastructure.Design your distribution center infrastructure to be scalable so it can accommodate growth and seasonal fluctuations in demand.This might involve investing in flexible storage solutions and adaptable technologies that can handle large order volumes.Carriers\nCarriers like USPS, UPS, and FedEx are responsible for physically transporting packages from the point of origin to the end destination.As an ecommerce business, your choice of carriers influences shipping costs, delivery speed, and the reliability of the overall logistics operation.Collaborating effectively with carriers ensures a smooth shipping experience for your customers.When packages are in the hands of carriers, you don’t have much control over what happens to them.So it’s your responsibility to proactively communicate with carriers to ensure high-quality delivery.As you vet and begin working with new carriers, research their reliability.If your shipping data shows recurring issues (like frequent lost, damaged, or delayed shipments) reach out immediately to discuss solutions.Every carrier comes with a cost.In addition to paying base shipping rates, you’ll need to pay additional fees for oversized packages, residential delivery, peak season shipping, and more.With so many factors to consider, your best bet for finding the most affordable carrier services is using shipping software.Shipping platforms let you integrate with new carriers quickly and optimize for the best ways to send packages.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"o4tnc8nSRo76wBBhVMYus/aFK1w/058AaDNxqE3UiMo="},"1bc6649c-5bdd-4779-bf37-db94cef42913":{"id_":"1bc6649c-5bdd-4779-bf37-db94cef42913","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9986b3fd-76ae-4cdf-b72e-1b361a03643b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"hash":"VRd1p6M+++bW6ut2odRJvKx3oiynCM594emWpmMb8Ac="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3265cc3c-1ee7-4942-a66a-65f2212cad8f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"hash":"limOhvY5p1I93Csj0YXEMMxRmuQ2F0jKNJLpwxlHKxc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"00027baa-8bba-4535-abc4-c0bc4682c690","metadata":{},"hash":"UIoCL3C3w0WB31K0rndjgJxz+UYrmQSGv4Cr+lFhXHo="}},"text":"As

you integrate with new carriers quickly and optimize for the best ways to send packages.You’ll save money by automating the shipping process and accessing special discounted rates (including getting to keep any discounts you’ve already locked in with individual carriers).3PLs or 4PLs\nRather than handling logistics internally, some businesses outsource to a 3PL or 4PL.This comes with pros and cons: While it simplifies shipping, it also decreases your direct control over the delivery experience.If you do decide to outsource, your 3PL(s) and/or 4PL will play an important role in sending packages quickly and accurately.Third-party logistics providers, or 3PLs, handle the hands-on tasks of order fulfillment.They store your inventory in their distribution centers, then pick, pack, and ship orders.Fourth-party logistics providers, or 4PLs, strategically oversee every element of your supply chain.This often includes managing relationships with one or more 3PLs.The 4PL acts as an intermediary between you and your 3PLs to simplify communication.While 3PLs definitely help streamline order fulfillment, they don’t have the scope or resources to craft an end-to-end supply chain strategy—for that, you’ll need a 4PL.Whichever one you go with, it’s essential to thoroughly understand their costs, processes, and tech stack before signing a contract.Optimization tip: Set clear expectations.Before deciding to work with a 3PL or 4PL, do your research.Learn their capabilities, including infrastructure, technology, experience, and expertise in your industry.The logistics provider should be able to meet not only your current requirements, but future ones as your organization scales.Regularly review key performance indicators (KPIs) to see whether the logistics provider is meeting agreed-upon standards.Leveraging technology to optimize your shipping process\nEven little inefficiencies in your shipping process can lead to delayed or inaccurate orders.This wastes money and increases the risk of losing customers or getting negative online reviews.So, which tech can help you increase efficiency and optimize your shipping process?We recommend prioritizing the following systems.Enterprise shipping software\nShipping costs have a big impact on your profits, and they also play a role in determining whether online shoppers purchase from you.When consumers are choosing what stores to do business with, free shipping is the number one concern for 80% of them\nopen_in_new\n, and 38% at least want to see “reasonable fees.”Many organizations lock in shipping rates with carriers, regularly negotiating contracts.This can be beneficial during a shipper’s market, when low demand for parcel shipping causes carriers to lower prices.However, negotiating rates with carriers isn’t always the right move.An alternative to working with just a few carriers and negotiating contracts is to use shipping software instead.These platforms integrate with large, local, and regional carriers, allowing you to ship with whichever ones work best in different scenarios.They also provide access to competitive discounted rates and present the most cost-effective methods of shipping each package.If you use EasyPost Enterprise, you’ll get the best of both worlds: In addition to accessing our discounted rates, you’ll be able to keep any rates you’ve already negotiated.Inventory management system and WMS\nGood shipping starts with your warehouses.The faster orders are picked and packed, the faster you’ll be able to get orders out to customers.An inventory management system and WMS will work together to keep your facilities running smoothly.Inventory management systems track inventory across all locations, letting you know when it’s time to replenish stock to meet customer demand.They help with supply chain management, demand forecasting, restocking, and storage.Your WMS goes hand-in-hand with your inventory management system, optimizing inventory management, order picking, and shipping processes.It provides real-time visibility into inventory levels, tracks product movements, and automates various tasks to reduce manual errors and improve overall accuracy.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"c757/GysHmFrX/OzjQF3rffVujiNCnBz1V4y8BP3WtI="},"00027baa-8bba-4535-abc4-c0bc4682c690":{"id_":"00027baa-8bba-4535-abc4-c0bc4682c690","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9986b3fd-76ae-4cdf-b72e-1b361a03643b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"hash":"VRd1p6M+++bW6ut2odRJvKx3oiynCM594emWpmMb8Ac="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1bc6649c-5bdd-4779-bf37-db94cef42913","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-02-22-how-to-optimize-shipping-process"},"hash":"VqcHMS+Q8LX1oJHiWDkpdhzPgkCwBt0lwzG3ciaLGos="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f5825f10-878f-422c-ae14-a41e6380a666","metadata":{},"hash":"nmb3CcKlXJ7M3kIzgniv81wE60Rmzd1n+6QRDMpLz84="}},"text":"If

platform\nBefore you start trying to optimize processes, you need to learn what’s working well with your shipping operations and what’s not going so great.You can do this by collecting and analyzing data.Ideally, make sure all your technology is integrated so data flows seamlessly between platforms.Then, using analytics software, you can visualize all the information and notice patterns in performance.While data brings valuable insights, it can be difficult to collect and use it.One survey reveals that the top two data-related challenges\nopen_in_new\n for supply chains are \"timely, easy access to data\" and \"integration of data across users, technologies, and the broader supply chain.”If your logistics operations are especially complex, or if you’re planning on undergoing massive changes (like bringing fulfillment back in-house after working with a 3PL), it can be helpful to consult outside experts who can interpret data, suggest changes, and work with you to see them through.Improve your shipping process with EasyPost Enterprise\nTechnology plays an essential role in streamlining your operations.By strategically integrating it into your shipping strategy, you

Use Consolidated Freight for Reduced Shipping Costs\nApril 03, 2024\nby Jaidyn Farar\nTweet\nShare\nLooking for a way to save money on freight shipping?If your shipments aren’t large enough to fill a large shipping container or truck, you can use consolidated freight to your advantage.Here’s what you need to know.What is consolidated freight?Consolidated freight, also known as consolidated shipping or cargo consolidation, is a shipping process that combines goods from multiple businesses into a single shipment.The goods are transported as part of the same load, and when they reach their destination, they’re deconsolidated and sent for last-mile delivery.When multiple LTL (less-than-truckload)\nopen_in_new\n or LCL (less-than-container load) shipments are combined, every business involved can access lower shipping rates and maximize efficiency.Consolidated freight shipping also reduces carbon emissions.Consolidated freight transportation methods\nConsolidated freight is commonly used to ship goods via air, ocean, and ground.Each of these methods has pros and cons, with tradeoffs between delivery speed and cost.Air.Air is the fastest consolidated freight shipping method, but it’s also the most expensive and produces the most carbon dioxide.Ocean.When sending goods internationally, ocean shipping is more affordable than air.This method of freight consolidation is best for large goods.Ground.Ground shipping is the most cost-effective way to transport freight, but it generally has the longest delivery times.LTL vs. LCL vs. FTL shipping\nLTL (less than truckload) shipping involves combining multiple shipments from different businesses into a single truckload, allowing each business to pay only for the space they use.With FTL (full truckload) shipping, on the other hand, an entire truck is dedicated to a single shipment.FTL is ideal for larger shipments that require more space, while LTL is perfect for smaller shipments that don’t require an entire truck to themselves.Less than container load (LCL) shipping is similar to LTL, with both methods combining multiple shipments into a single load to optimize efficiency and cost-effectiveness.They simply differ in the mode of transportation; LTL refers to trucking, while LCL refers to maritime shipping.How consolidated freight can benefit your business\nConsolidated freight offers great benefits, including cost savings, risk reduction, and increased flexibility.Cost savings.Consolidated freight shipping allows you to combine shipments with those of other businesses, only paying for the space your goods take up.This drives down shipping costs per unit and often gives you access to reduced shipping rates.Reduced risk of damage.Securely packing goods together in consolidated shipments minimizes the risk of damage during transit, as items are less likely to shift or become damaged due to handling.Lower carbon footprint.More consolidated shipments means fewer trucks on the road, planes in the air, and ships on the sea.This helps minimize the carbon emissions associated with logistics, making consolidated freight an excellent way to reduce your environmental impact.Streamlined delivery process.Combining shipments allows for better route optimization, which leads to faster transit times and improved overall efficiency.Increased customer satisfaction.The benefits already discussed all contribute to one important outcome: increased customer satisfaction.When you transport goods quickly and cost-effectively (and keep them safe from damage), customers will be happy with the delivery experience and more likely to order again.Common consolidated freight challenges\nAlong with benefits, consolidated freight comes with challenges, including potential delays and coordination difficulties.Complex coordination.Managing communication and coordination with multiple shippers and carriers can be complex, leading to potential issues such as miscommunication or missed pickups.It’s the shipper’s responsibility to be aware of the factors involved with consolidated freight, including shipment volume and dimensions, delivery times, and pricing.Carrier selection.If don’t work with a partner to coordinate consolidated shipping, you’ll need to handle the details yourself.Finding a carrier that will carry consolidated shipments can be tricky—and when you do, you need to make sure you’re getting a good price.Understanding the consolidated freight process\nHow do you ship with consolidated freight?Let’s review how the process works from start to finish.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cv+t7dAzVNJR5BE4Vo8Dd538lvDjQssa8iooo9lN1zo="},"657e9a35-297b-45f2-add8-63e0c1fd3c0c":{"id_":"657e9a35-297b-45f2-add8-63e0c1fd3c0c","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-04-03-how-to-use-consolidated-freight-for-reduced-shipping-costs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6e810f40-5ab5-4671-b25d-034b26f5f6c0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-04-03-how-to-use-consolidated-freight-for-reduced-shipping-costs"},"hash":"iH3N809vXBx1tcyxmEp5WmGkvtuR2r7f2Ky2iGclqvE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"10f64077-d8c1-4643-8572-3d2d57c048a1","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-04-03-how-to-use-consolidated-freight-for-reduced-shipping-costs"},"hash":"cv+t7dAzVNJR5BE4Vo8Dd538lvDjQssa8iooo9lN1zo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"88a8fa42-eabc-4d6a-9768-eb2ec32d8787","metadata":{},"hash":"zWHHQEas948BFk63ltS6XLxZPCgOazIgYr+jbvyjrec="}},"text":"When

process\nHow do you ship with consolidated freight?Let’s review how the process works from start to finish.Planning and coordination\nFirst, businesses plan their shipments and coordinate with logistics partners, such as third-party logistics providers (3PLs) or freight brokers, to arrange for consolidation.During this stage, they may use load planning software\nopen_in_new\n to crate and palletize goods as efficiently as possible.Partners gather information on shipments, including their volume, characteristics, destinations, and delivery date requirements, and find compatible loads to combine.They also select the appropriate mode of transportation—air, ocean, or land—and identify the best consolidation point.Consolidation and loading\nAfter goods are picked up from individual shippers, they’re taken to a designated consolidation point.There, shipments are sorted, grouped, and loaded onto trucks, containers, or pallets for transport to their final destinations.Efficient consolidation and loading practices help maximize space utilization and minimize transportation costs.Shipping\nNext, consolidated shipments are transported to their destinations, either directly or via intermediate hubs.Throughout the shipping process, businesses can track the movement of their shipments in real time, which allows them to promptly address potential issues or delays.Delivery and unloading\nWhen trucks arrive at their final destinations, consolidated shipments are unloaded, deconsolidated, and distributed to recipients or fulfillment centers.Businesses coordinate with receivers or warehouse operators to ensure smooth delivery and efficient unloading of goods.Simplify consolidated freight shipping with the right technology\nAs you’ve seen, consolidated shipping is a cost-effective, eco-friendly shipping method for loads that don’t require an entire truck or shipping container.But managing the consolidation process can be challenging, especially if freight shipping isn’t your business’s primary focus.The EasyPost Enterprise Shipping solution can help.The platform, which is available on-premise and through the cloud, streamlines parcel, LTL, and FTL

Negotiating Shipping Rates With Your Carrier\nSeptember 19, 2017\nby Jillian Voege\nTweet\nShare\nThis article was updated 8/5/2024.Sometimes, it might seem like the cost of shipping can be inelastic; there’s a little bit of wiggle room when you negotiate rates with your carrier, but the rates and fees are what they are.Many small businesses don’t feel like they have enough clout to get advantageous rates, while businesses of all sizes have to deal with the increasing amount of surcharges and fees that carriers tack on with each passing year.The trick isn’t to go into your contract negotiations trying to steal concessions.Ultimately, it’s about demonstrating value and justifying why carriers should give you better rates.If you look at your shipping contract in those terms, then it shouldn’t matter how big or small you are.You can get a better contract by increasing your value or leverage to the carrier in any way you can.Keeping that in mind, we have created a simple, step-by-step guide that will walk you through how to negotiate shipping rates with carriers.1.Be informed—and bring your data to the meeting\nIn order to demonstrate value, you have to be able to answer any and all questions the carrier might ask about your business and its future.You should know your operations inside and out, from the total packages shipped last year to the forecast of packages that will be shipped next year.Relying solely on the carrier's information gives them the upper hand, but having your own data provides leverage.Prepare for negotiations by gathering comprehensive shipping data, including package volume, size, and weight, broken down by carrier and service level.Additionally, be sure to understand the costs associated with overnight delivery, peak season surcharges, fuel surcharges, and address corrections.Additionally, bring information on the carrier's performance, such as any delays or missing packages.This preparation will help you negotiate more favorable terms and ensure you have the insights needed to make informed decisions.“When you're going in, review the data.What are your on-time delivery rates?What are your damage rates?Were there service failures?What complaints do you have?And then look for opportunities where [service] can be improved.You know, maybe you're having new service offerings or shipping volumes.You've got an upcoming promotional period or seasonal spikes that you're wanting to discuss.Just make sure that you have all the information ready to go beforehand.”— Lori Boyer, “Mastering the Shipping Rates Battle”\n  2.Decide what to negotiate about\nWhen negotiating shipping rates, it’s important to have a plan.Start by researching a carrier’s pricing, including additional fees and surcharges.Then decide which you want to lower or waive.Keep in mind the following potential charges:\nDimensional weight pricing.When calculating shipping costs, carriers often use dimensional (DIM) weight pricing.If you frequently ship large, lightweight packages, negotiating a better DIM factor will be in your best interest.Insurance.Using a third-party insurance company for your shipments can significantly reduce shipping costs, particularly for high-value items.But if you prefer to use carrier insurance, you might want to see if they’ll lower premiums for your packages.Residential delivery surcharge.Residential deliveries typically cost more than commercial deliveries due to additional logistical challenges, and major carriers usually impose surcharges to cover these costs.By discussing these surcharges with your carrier, you may be able to negotiate lower fees or even have them waived, reducing your overall shipping expense\nLarge package surcharge.The large package surcharge applies to shipments exceeding specific dimensions or weight, typically those over 130 combined inches or 90 pounds.If your business frequently ships large packages, negotiating a reduction in this surcharge can significantly lower your shipping costs.Surcharges are especially important to negotiate because they increase quickly (sometimes faster than base shipping rates).Consider the characteristics of your average shipment—size, weight, destination, and shipping distance—and try to bring down the associated surcharges.3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ur1aiCsc1bHLcyzBJnjYDXDt6D0429dolYBj/76zk6M="},"ba1e47b0-09a1-459a-910e-be08058d9dde":{"id_":"ba1e47b0-09a1-459a-910e-be08058d9dde","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2017-09-19-negotiating-with-your-carrier-for-better-rates"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9320d272-83a3-4b8a-8f34-d3a99254ae54","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2017-09-19-negotiating-with-your-carrier-for-better-rates"},"hash":"28Ifd+DMq05oDqz4g20vtHazQ58dlUOpKwQkfga35Jc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"638f7f5e-e8bb-44dc-9473-cdf2f54d8fe5","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2017-09-19-negotiating-with-your-carrier-for-better-rates"},"hash":"ur1aiCsc1bHLcyzBJnjYDXDt6D0429dolYBj/76zk6M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"64f6b4a3-9a2d-4542-904d-9b9660a82e7f","metadata":{},"hash":"6rZtNAxrSKJAW2S087lyujgNMxxDqnkAAMAuGkZu6PE="}},"text":"But

especially important to negotiate because they increase quickly (sometimes faster than base shipping rates).Consider the characteristics of your average shipment—size, weight, destination, and shipping distance—and try to bring down the associated surcharges.3.Compare carrier rates\nWe recommend getting a good lay of the land of shipping rates from all carriers—not just the major ones, but regional ones too—to use as leverage when you’re negotiating lower rates or surcharges from your main carrier.Comparing shipping options doesn’t just help with negotiations.It also gives you insights into the pricing that other carriers are offering so you can find the best rates and services.Each carrier offers different pricing structures, delivery times, and service levels.By evaluating and comparing these factors, you can choose the most cost-effective and reliable shipping partners for your business needs.4.Stay up-to-date with industry trends\nStaying informed about current trends and costs in the shipping industry is crucial when negotiating shipping rates.By keeping track of your carrier and other carriers’ pricing strategies, service changes, and market fluctuations, you can identify the best times to negotiate for lower rates or improved terms.Understanding the broader industry landscape allows you to benchmark your rates against competitors and leverage this information to secure better deals.What are competitors (or people in similar industries) paying for shipping?What discounts do they get?Try doing some research online or talk to people at industry events to find this information.5.Read the fine print\nHidden fees can significantly inflate your shipping costs if overlooked.Carefully review contracts and service agreements to identify and understand these fees.By reading the fine print and asking detailed questions, you can avoid unexpected charges and better manage your shipping budget.6.Have a backup plan\nBeing prepared to walk away from a negotiation is a powerful strategy that ensures you do not settle for unfavorable terms.Recognize that your current carrier may not always offer the best deal, and exploring alternative carriers can reveal better opportunities.Having a backup plan and being willing to switch carriers demonstrates to your current provider that you are serious about obtaining competitive rates\n    “Be very open, and know what your goal price is. …Be like, hey, this is my goal.If you can meet this goal, great.But if you can't, let's both move on.Being very clear about what your goals and needs are is going to make your negotiation a very smooth and easy process.You want to make sure [the agreement] works for both businesses.”— Ryan Leahy, “Mastering the Shipping Rates Battle”\n  7.Prioritize relationships\nThe deeper the relationship with your carrier is, the more likely they’ll give you more concessions or perks when your contract is up for renewal.Frequent communication matters more than you might think!Don’t just talk to your account manager every year or two—check up on them every quarter to catch up.Not only will you make the relationship more valuable and future negotiations more fruitful, but you’ll also stay up-to-date on any moves your carrier might make.It’s also important to understand the way your carrier operates.Learning their operations and terminology will help you speak their lingo and negotiate a better deal.8.Remember, it never hurts to ask\nAs you go into the details, it doesn’t hurt to ask about any relief from extra surcharges or fees that are tacked onto your packages.It may also help to run some projections to see if you can save money by eliminating surcharges and fees instead of lowering rates.This way, you’ll be aware of every angle you can push to lower your overall shipping bill.As long as companies rely on carriers to move products, shipping will always be a major part of your operations budget.It’ll be a constant push-and-pull between you and your carrier, but if you approach your negotiations as a partner and emphasize the symbiotic nature of your relationship, you’ll come away with a much better contract that gives you more room to grow.9.Get lower shipping rates the easy way\nNegotiating with carriers can be immensely satisfying and productive.Lots of businesses are able to get lower rates and surcharges through the negotiation process.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ku6PtFvBekJ8Rs77eToj48oHCKW3c61TGl/9gf3or8g="},"64f6b4a3-9a2d-4542-904d-9b9660a82e7f":{"id_":"64f6b4a3-9a2d-4542-904d-9b9660a82e7f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2017-09-19-negotiating-with-your-carrier-for-better-rates"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9320d272-83a3-4b8a-8f34-d3a99254ae54","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2017-09-19-negotiating-with-your-carrier-for-better-rates"},"hash":"28Ifd+DMq05oDqz4g20vtHazQ58dlUOpKwQkfga35Jc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ba1e47b0-09a1-459a-910e-be08058d9dde","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2017-09-19-negotiating-with-your-carrier-for-better-rates"},"hash":"IoBG50/FXFLAusnTc25g0EcY8w4rWpi1kCWaaJ7Wf0w="}},"text":"8.Remember,

be delivered quickly.Overnight shipping\nOvernight shipping is typically the fastest service level carriers offer.These packages typically arrive within 1-2 business days, depending on how far they are traveling.Overnight shipping is the most expensive shipping option, but it's a good choice if you need a package delivered quickly and you're willing to pay for the convenience.Cost of shipping based on package size\nIf you're looking for the most affordable shipping option, it's important to consider the size of your package.Generally, the larger the package, the more expensive it is to ship.This is because it takes up more space and will likely weigh more, requiring more resources to handle and transport.Envelopes\nEnvelopes come in many different sizes and can be made from different materials, such as paper or plastic.They usually cost less to ship than packages, so they're a good option if you're looking for a more affordable shipping option.Envelopes are a good choice for shipping small items, such as documents or greeting cards.However, they do have some limitations.They can only hold items that are small and flat, so if you're shipping somewhat larger items, such as books or clothing, an envelope may not be able to accommodate them.Small packages\nSmall packages are best for shipping items such as books, clothes, and small electronics.These packages generally cost more to ship than envelopes, but they can hold more and are less likely to be damaged in transit.Many carriers offer competitive flat-rate shipping options for small packages.This means that you can ship your package for a fixed price, regardless of its weight or destination.Large packages\nLarge packages can carry multiple small items or accommodate more sizable items, such as furniture, appliances, and large electronics.Large packages cost more to ship than small and medium-sized packages, but if you are shipping a large volume of items, it will likely be more economical than shipping several small packages.Large packages are typically rated based on their dimensional weight.The greater the dimensional weight, the more expensive shipping will be.When shipping large packages, it's more important to put thought into which carrier you're choosing because some offer more competitive rates than others for oversized packages.Measuring package dimensions\nTo calculate the shipping cost of a package based on its size, you need to know its dimensions.You can find them by using a ruler or tape measure to determine your package's length, width, and height.These dimensions are typically measured in inches and can be used to calculate the dimensional weight of a package.Flat-rate shipping\nFlat-rate shipping is a pricing model where you pay a fixed price for your shipment, regardless of its weight or destination.Flat-rate shipping is a good option if you're shipping heavy goods, as the price is not based on the weight of the package.Cost of shipping based on package weight\nThe cost of shipping can vary based on the weight of a package.This is fairly straightforward—the heavier a package, the more it typically costs to ship.This pricing structure makes sense because it costs carriers more money to ship heavier packages, especially when it comes to fuel and labor costs.Cheapest way to ship light packages\nIf you're looking for the most affordable way to ship a light package under 2 pounds, USPS First Class Mail is your best option.Compared to FedEx and UPS, delivery may take longer.However, it's significantly cheaper, making it the best option for budget-conscious shippers.Cheapest way to ship heavy packages\nEach shipping carrier varies in its definition of a heavy package.For example, a heavy package is anything over 70 lbs for USPS, but for UPS and FedEx, a heavy package is anything over 150 lbs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"GOpLmXmqJet8Oc/jklel6dCKDXS3nXbuH5f8jzyZ0U4="},"22dc4750-918b-4ad3-85ca-9a76ac4dbac5":{"id_":"22dc4750-918b-4ad3-85ca-9a76ac4dbac5","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-09-20-cheapest-ways-to-ship-packages"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"95e39d07-c6e0-476e-b6d7-7e2ab6cd455b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-09-20-cheapest-ways-to-ship-packages"},"hash":"wgo7YB1QSYjDBe1Ibuy/eFsmJH/63SkPgue7oktEVjc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8aff66fe-df5e-44ef-89d4-c54d86ae6f7f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-09-20-cheapest-ways-to-ship-packages"},"hash":"jWq92guWD32Ygm7QNh7rZAP9MMJHo3IrJ1ui3sAbYrY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"625616d9-531f-48f7-a9bf-a79782e02944","metadata":{},"hash":"e2xwv8tPTQ7nqHZo89BL2LfLiMxiSD/MHRhIOozEIAM="}},"text":"Cost

Less-Than-Truckload Carriers To Cut Shipping Costs\nAugust 28, 2024\nby Jaidyn Farar\nTweet\nShare\nWhen sending items that weigh up to 150 pounds, parcel shipping is usually the way to go.But what about large, heavy items or bulk shipments?For these types of deliveries, freight shipping is the most cost-effective method.This article will explain how businesses can cut shipping costs by relying on a diverse mix of less-than-truckload carriers.But let’s start at the beginning—what exactly is less-than-truckload shipping?What is LTL shipping?Less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping is a type of freight shipping used when a shipment weighs between 150 and 15,000 pounds, is palletized or crated, and doesn’t require a truck’s full capacity to transport.In LTL shipping, multiple shipments from different businesses are combined into a single truck, allowing each shipper to share the transportation costs.This makes LTL a cost-effective and flexible option for sending large shipments or bulky items.What is an LTL carrier?A less-than-truckload carrier is a transportation service provider that consolidates shipments from multiple customers into a single truckload.These carriers coordinate pickups and deliveries, combining shipments with similar destinations to optimize the use of space and reduce shipping costs.Like parcel shipping, LTL shipping is more efficient and cost-effective when you rate shop and use multiple carriers.The carrier mix you use will depend on your shipping needs, including destinations, handling requirements, and delivery requirements.For example, if you need residential delivery, you’ll want to find a carrier that offers that service.By using multiple less-than-truckload carriers, businesses can efficiently ship goods across the country (or simply between states) without having to pay for unused truck space.LTL vs. truckload carriers\nSo, when should businesses use an LTL carrier vs. a truckload carrier?The main difference between LTL and truckload carriers is the size of the shipments they handle.As mentioned, LTL carriers consolidate multiple smaller shipments (up to 15,000 pounds) from different customers into a single truck.In contrast, truckload carriers transport larger shipments that fill an entire truck.While this comes with a higher cost, it also allows truckload carriers to offer more direct routes and faster transit times.Benefits of less-than-truckload shipping \nLess-than-truckload shipping has several significant benefits, including cost savings, flexible delivery options, a decreased environmental impact, and a lower risk of package damage.Cost savings.With LTL shipping, businesses can share transportation costs with other shippers by combining small loads into one truck.Because this shared approach costs less than paying for an entire truck, it’s a more budget-friendly option.Flexibility.Less-than-truckload carriers offer a range of services and options, such as liftgate delivery, inside pickup and delivery, and special handling, which can be tailored to meet specific shipping needs.Environmental efficiency.By consolidating multiple shipments into one truck, LTL shipping maximizes the use of available space and reduces the number of trucks on the road.The result?Decreased fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.Lower risk of damage.LTL loads are typically palletized and secured to minimize movement and prevent damage.This helps reduce the risk of damage compared to parcel shipping, where packages are handled more frequently.How LTL works\nLTL shipping uses complex networks of shipping lanes and consolidation hubs.Loads are picked up, consolidated and transported, and deconsolidated for final delivery.Let’s explore the process in more depth:\nDrivers pick up multiple loads.The shipping process begins when drivers head out to pick up scheduled shipments.They gather loads from multiple shippers within the same area to efficiently fill a truck's capacity.Shipments are consolidated and transported.Once collected, shipments are transported to a local terminal or hub where they’re consolidated with other freight heading in the same direction.The LTL carrier then transports the shipments to their respective regional distribution centers or hubs.Depending on the distance and the specific routes involved, the freight may be transferred between several terminals.Shipments are deconsolidated.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dJZ1CyNR8kwqG+O2FtIAB9syLiGhW8+QFLsDgJcNBlc="},"9b3e8dbc-6762-451e-ab8f-47275ae02c67":{"id_":"9b3e8dbc-6762-451e-ab8f-47275ae02c67","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-08-28-less-than-truckload-carriers"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e0419abd-f3d0-4d61-9a2e-6bed1d1a2d70","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-08-28-less-than-truckload-carriers"},"hash":"V60orDlYIVpKm3OrzVaPOmFTXJQczvE6QLE8KN56ZLk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9feaef78-950d-49ef-99f0-a2eb32d14362","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-08-28-less-than-truckload-carriers"},"hash":"dJZ1CyNR8kwqG+O2FtIAB9syLiGhW8+QFLsDgJcNBlc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"32249a7f-82ac-4d59-b2e0-c8f1187497ac","metadata":{},"hash":"CFksgXvelLAjeyEX2RLstdvBbRnonRle7rsrCGK0FMQ="}},"text":"Lower

deconsolidated.The freight is separated according to delivery addresses and prepared for last-mile delivery.Drivers complete last-mile delivery.Finally, each shipment is delivered to its destination.Types of less-than-truckload carriers and when to use them\nEvery LTL carrier has its own business model, pricing, and specializations.Along with these differences come both advantages and disadvantages, and it’s up to shippers to find the right balance of cost, service, and speed to meet their transportation needs.Let’s explore seven types of LTL carriers and when to use them.National\nNational LTL carriers are the most common type and are ideal for shippers who need to send shipments across the country.These large companies generally have networks that stretch from coast to coast and border to border, though they might rely on partners for last-mile delivery to some areas.While national carriers provide broad coverage, their rates aren’t always as competitive as those offered by specialized carriers, especially for low-volume shippers.Despite this, most businesses have at least one national LTL carrier in their network.Multi-regional\nRegional LTL carriers don’t offer coverage across the entire country; instead, they serve several specific regions.Their coverage area is smaller than that of national carriers but larger than that of regional carriers (discussed below).While they don’t have the coast-to-coast reach of national carriers, regional carriers excel in providing efficient service within their regions, often offering competitive pricing for medium to high-volume shippers.Regional\nRegional LTL carriers serve a specific, defined area—typically a few states.A regional carrier generally operates several facilities within its region but doesn’t extend its coverage to other areas.Regional carriers offer significant advantages for shippers within their service areas, including competitive pricing and high-quality service.Because they’re focused on relatively small geographic locations, they have in-depth knowledge of regional needs, allowing them to ship quickly and efficiently and avoid disruptions.Sub-regional\nSub-regional LTL carriers cover smaller portions of a region, making them ideal for shipments that don’t travel long distances.Businesses that ship regularly within these sub-regions have a greater opportunity to negotiate volume discounts.Asset-light\nAsset-light LTL carriers are less common than the other types of LTL carriers we’ve discussed so far.What sets them apart is that they keep their assets—trucks, terminals, and drivers—to a minimum.Instead, they partner with other truckload and LTL carriers to coordinate shipments, potentially renting out terminals or sub-contracting routes.Because asset-light carriers don’t need to invest in infrastructure, they can offer large coverage areas and affordable rates.However, the trade-offs include longer transit times and more handling, as freight may be transferred between multiple carriers during its journey.Load-to-ride\nLoad-to-ride carriers focus on bulky or long-range shipments where minimizing product handling is a priority.In this model, the driver picks up freight from multiple shippers and drives directly to the destination, rarely stopping at terminals.This reduces the number of handoffs and the potential for damage by keeping the shipment in a single truck for the entire journey.The downside?Load-to-ride shipping requires flexibility with the carrier's schedule and may have limitations in capacity and coverage.Reefer (refrigerated)\nReefer (or refrigerated) LTL carriers specialize in long-range shipments that require temperature control, such as food and pharmaceuticals.These carriers use refrigerated containers to keep shipments at consistent temperatures throughout the journey, with few transfers at terminals.Getting started with LTL\nWhen getting started with LTL, it’s important to know what to look for in a carrier.To find the less-than-truckload carriers that are a fit for your business, you’ll need to do some research.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CGucMaknTiOAHOt8jv+OoLusZuMxOfVTa/IO+HUyZ24="},"32249a7f-82ac-4d59-b2e0-c8f1187497ac":{"id_":"32249a7f-82ac-4d59-b2e0-c8f1187497ac","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-08-28-less-than-truckload-carriers"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e0419abd-f3d0-4d61-9a2e-6bed1d1a2d70","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-08-28-less-than-truckload-carriers"},"hash":"V60orDlYIVpKm3OrzVaPOmFTXJQczvE6QLE8KN56ZLk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9b3e8dbc-6762-451e-ab8f-47275ae02c67","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2024-08-28-less-than-truckload-carriers"},"hash":"Pzmav7QTMETeCaJ6OMLPTgbgsCZfKuxV695IFmudbaY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c407f6c1-e689-458e-907f-2749d73e7b23","metadata":{},"hash":"Rb4OBL9+1cx4yDmfTLXTeLr9MnX2iKYp9eOX6fEGTYE="}},"text":"In

and geographic coverage, available equipment, service offerings, and ease of use to make sure they can meet your shipping needs.Pricing.Though you might be tempted to evaluate base rates alone, remember to take service into account when evaluating costs.Getting low rates doesn’t mean much if you have to spend lots of time and money dealing with the consequences of damage and delays.Network density and geographic coverage.Assess the carrier's network density by determining how many trucks operate in the lanes you need covered.Additionally, learn which geographic areas the carrier covers, making sure they can deliver to your desired areas.Available equipment.Check whether the carrier provides the necessary equipment for your shipments, such as refrigeration for temperature-sensitive goods or lift gates for easier loading and unloading.Service.An LTL carrier’s service plays a major role in your customers’ satisfaction.Work with carriers that pick up and deliver shipments on time, don’t have high damage rates, and offer additional services you need, such as inside or residential delivery.Ease of use.Consider the digital platform and communication tools offered by the carrier.Can you easily request quotes, track shipments, and file claims through a self-service portal?These features will streamline your shipping operations and improve efficiency.Things to be aware of when shipping LTL\nShipping LTL requires careful coordination to ensure smooth and efficient delivery.Being mindful of the following factors can help you avoid common issues and improve the reliability of your shipments.Paperwork.Proper documentation helps prevent delays and ensures that your shipment is processed correctly.For every LTL shipment, you’ll need to provide a complete and accurate bill of lading (BOL).This document will include detailed information about the shipper and recipient, as well as the specifics of the shipment itself.Freight protection.While LTL shipping decreases the likelihood of damage, there’s always a chance that products may get broken or ruined during transportation.To prevent damage, package your shipments securely, considering factors like shifting during transport, handling, and exposure to different temperatures and humidity levels.Weather.You should be aware of weather conditions that could impact your shipment's transit; for example, snow, ice, and floods can block roads and lead to delays.To avoid disruptions, monitor weather forecasts for the areas your shipment will travel through and plan accordingly.Connect with reliable LTL carriers instantly\nSome LTL carriers prioritize cost savings, offering lower rates but potentially slower delivery times.On the other hand, some LTL carriers focus on providing faster service at a higher price.By working with multiple carriers, you can leverage these distinct offerings to optimize your logistics strategy.A multi-carrier shipping platform like EasyPost Enterprise

Cheapest Shipping for Small Business Owners\nMay 25, 2022\nby EasyPost\nTweet\nShare\nAs costs across the board continue to rise, it's stressful to think about how to stay afloat as a small business.Inflation, increasing manufacturing costs, and shipping rate hikes are all nerve-racking concerns to navigate.But despite these challenges, your business can continue to attract new customers and provide a great customer experience—without breaking the bank.Today, we're here to show you how to get the cheapest shipping for small business owners and operators.If you're a small business owner or employee looking to decrease shipping costs, you're in the right place.Here is a full overview of why shipping rates are so high and what you can do to reduce those costs.What are shipping costs?Shipping costs are any of the fees associated with fulfilling and mailing a package.In the ecommerce realm, this typically includes packaging materials, carrier rates, and any additional charges that occur throughout this process, such as peak season surcharges.Shipping costs can vary from order to order depending on a variety of factors, including the size and weight of the goods and the distance a parcel travels to reach its destination.Small businesses shipping can be tricky when it comes to cost-savings.With limited logistics resources, maintaining competitive delivery times poses a major challenge.And if your industry faces fluctuating demand, you may find it especially difficult to plan for supply chain challenges that affect your parcel shipping.Decreasing your shipping costs will take time and experimentation.The first step is understanding how they’re calculated.How are shipping costs calculated?As previously mentioned, a variety of factors go into determining shipping costs.As far as supplies go, the amount you spend will depend on the materials you choose.For example, corrugated boxes are going to cost more than poly mailers.Depending on your products and priorities, you can choose the materials and price point that works for you.Once materials are taken care of, the carrier you choose determines the majority of the remaining shipping costs.The main factors carriers consider when determining shipping rates are a parcel's weight, dimensions, and destination.Understanding how carriers charge for shipping can help you find ways to have the cheapest shipping.For a more detailed breakdown of all the factors that determine shipping costs, check out this article.How do small businesses save money on shipping?Because small businesses ship fewer packages than mid-sized or large organizations, they may not have access to the best deals and discounts.The result?High shipping rates put a burden on customers and businesses alike.However, the good news is that it’s possible to reduce shipping costs significantly.Cheap shipping for small business—although it may sound too good to be true, small businesses can reduce their shipping costs in a variety of ways.Some methods may be easier than others, but here are five we typically recommend to our users to help them start saving.1.Use free shipping supplies from your carriers\nDid you know that some carriers will provide shippers supplies free of charge?That’s right—they’ll provide boxes, tubes, and mailers delivered right to your door.For example, if you ship flat-rate with USPS and FedEx, you can access flat-rate boxes and envelopes for free.Be sure to check with your carrier to see what offers they have available, as this is a quick way to cut down on your total shipping costs.If your carriers don’t offer free packaging, don’t despair!You can use other strategies to save on materials.For example, buying supplies in bulk or negotiating discounts with suppliers can lead to significant savings.Reusing or repurposing packaging materials whenever possible can also lower expenses.Remember, your packaging doesn’t necessarily have to be fancy.As long as it’s sturdy enough to withstand rough handling, your customers (and wallet) will be satisfied.2.Ship with multiple carriers\nHaving more than one carrier is critical to a small business.Not only does a multi-carrier shipping strategy allow you to ship with whoever has the best rate for your package, but it also can increase efficiency and reliability.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"QAO3y26FEVBLbydP+dVTcF1y9EuoSe1158OzZ65Er/s="},"3fbcbd60-6182-421c-9262-257392a56766":{"id_":"3fbcbd60-6182-421c-9262-257392a56766","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-05-25-5-ways-small-businesses-can-save-on-shipping-costs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ceb7fd7e-16e2-434c-9a34-7d3dc0b0a30a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-05-25-5-ways-small-businesses-can-save-on-shipping-costs"},"hash":"dNCp1sLqdTEq79WNKlvg1yNN3n6lkN4ZNfmUX8XIhgU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fad3f34d-cc85-4571-b6a7-d61b8f7919fe","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-05-25-5-ways-small-businesses-can-save-on-shipping-costs"},"hash":"QAO3y26FEVBLbydP+dVTcF1y9EuoSe1158OzZ65Er/s="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"67346aae-d28d-453f-b7e5-186005d924b1","metadata":{},"hash":"sIG9e1jy1at/6Mlv6rUFKRmsCEQW/FAsjueGMvyuO5c="}},"text":"For

small business.Not only does a multi-carrier shipping strategy allow you to ship with whoever has the best rate for your package, but it also can increase efficiency and reliability.Meeting delivery times during the holiday season—or any high-demand time—is difficult when using only one carrier, but by diversifying carrier options, a small business can more consistently meet its customers' expectations.Whether you're looking for regional, national, or international carriers, exploring multi-carrier shipping solutions can lead to better savings and reliability down the line.One great way to access multiple carriers is to use a shipping API like EasyPost.EasyPost allows you to integrate with over a hundred domestic and international carriers, automatically generate shipping labels, and optimize your shipping method selection.The best part?It’s free to use for small businesses!If you’re not using a shipping API or software, make sure to check each carrier’s individual shipping rates calculator to learn exactly which service is best for your shipments.As a general rule, USPS is one of your best shipping options for lightweight parcels (those under 5 pounds).For heavier packages going longer distances, UPS and FedEx might provide a better deal.3.Get shipping discounts based on volume\nIf you're regularly sending out packages, you shouldn't be paying the retail price on shipping rates.Even small businesses can negotiate with carriers for discounted rates on their shipping volume.If you haven't already, you absolutely should reach out to your carrier and see what discounts they can offer you.These tips can help you during the negotiation process:\nLeverage shipment volume.For better or for worse, it’s all about volume!You’ll be able to negotiate better rates when you demonstrate your potential shipment volume.Carriers often offer a grace period for discounted rates; if you can increase shipment volume by an agreed-upon amount during that period, you get to keep your discounts.Explore alternative options.Don't settle for the first carrier that offers a quote.Instead, research and approach multiple carriers to compare rates and services.You should also consider regional carriers or niche providers that offer competitive rates for specific routes or types of shipments.Negotiate service level agreements (SLAs).In addition to negotiating rates, negotiate favorable terms and SLAs that align with your business's needs.This could include delivery guarantees, flexible pickup options, or discounted rates for services like express or international shipping.If you can't get the rate down, don't feel discouraged.Shipping software, APIs, and other programs already have pre-negotiated rates that they can extend to you regardless of your personal shipping volume.For example, through EasyPost you can ship with USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, and LSO at a discounted rate.Best of all, there are no fees or volume minimums to access these discounts, so you'll definitely want to take advantage of them.4.Reduce the size and weight of your packages\nShipping costs are usually determined by service level, cubic size, weight, and zone.Some of these factors aren’t in your control—you can't choose where your customers want to receive their packages, and often it's difficult to be competitive without offering fast shipping.However, you can control the size and weight of the packages as they go out your door.Did you know that using smaller boxes brings down shipping costs?This is because carriers charge more for large, lightweight packages.If a package has a dimensional (DIM) weight that’s higher than its actual weight, you’ll have to pay more to ship it.Avoid DIM weight charges by packing items into perfectly sized boxes that don’t leave lots of extra room.In addition to packing goods in smaller boxes, opt for lighter-weight packing materials like bubble mailers to bring down the weight.More compact packages mean less waste both from the packaging itself and transport, leading to more environmentally friendly shipping.5.Choose the right parcel type\nWhen you’re shipping products to your customers, don’t just start sticking things in boxes.Depending on the carrier you use, you may get access to more cost-effective shipping by using certain parcel types.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gLayx79vTmGqqUq5QLDkZYpW+y5L9q7OjFkV1uQ5HxU="},"67346aae-d28d-453f-b7e5-186005d924b1":{"id_":"67346aae-d28d-453f-b7e5-186005d924b1","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-05-25-5-ways-small-businesses-can-save-on-shipping-costs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ceb7fd7e-16e2-434c-9a34-7d3dc0b0a30a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-05-25-5-ways-small-businesses-can-save-on-shipping-costs"},"hash":"dNCp1sLqdTEq79WNKlvg1yNN3n6lkN4ZNfmUX8XIhgU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3fbcbd60-6182-421c-9262-257392a56766","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-05-25-5-ways-small-businesses-can-save-on-shipping-costs"},"hash":"4RAF7TLbbgGvXlzfLI600TOmMBMi8FaQ65JF7pEH7wQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"87211562-ff94-4159-8c69-7a3bc0496e4b","metadata":{},"hash":"nlujD23UADb9WB7+/HeVWsXYi31hv8FAXZgLWdWE1io="}},"text":"However,

right parcel type can make a big difference.In some cases, flats can be cheaper to ship than parcels.Always check to see which classifications meet your needs and will give you a better price.A little research can go a long way in helping small businesses find savings.For example, if you're shipping any media, such as books or CDs, and not in a hurry, you can use USPS Media Mail for significant savings.Be sure to check with USPS guidelines\nopen_in_new\n to see if your package qualifies.Your small business shipping strategy\nWe’ve reviewed the cheapest shipping for small business owners, but

To Stay on Top of Shipping and Logistics Trends\nNovember 13, 2023\nby Jaidyn Farar\nTweet\nShare\nDo you get genuinely excited about the ever-changing landscape of shipping and logistics?Do you spend all your free time eagerly scrolling, watching, listening, and Googling to stay up-to-date with the latest trends?If you answered no, this article is for you.While lots of people out there are passionate about shipping (and that’s amazing!), there are lots of people who find it more difficult to get interested.You know you should be staying on top of what’s happening in the industry, but it’s hard to find the time when you have so much on your plate.But don’t worry!You can do it.Choose one (or two, or three) of the five suggestions below and get started.Before you know it, you’ll be an expert on all things logistics.1.Follow industry leaders on social media\nIf you’re like the majority of people, you spend a decent amount of time on social media—the worldwide average is 151 minutes\nopen_in_new\n.You can put a few of those minutes to good use by following industry leaders and experts.Search for shipping and logistics keywords you’re interested in, and look for people who are involved in those conversations and have a large following.Then, simply give them a follow on LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), or other sites.After that, their posts will come straight to your feed, and you’ll see them when you go online.For bonus points: When you see a great shipping and logistics post, leave a reaction or comment.This shows the algorithm that you’re interested in seeing related posts in the future.2.Go to trade shows and conferences\nAt trade shows and conferences, industry leaders gather to discuss some of the most cutting-edge technology, research, and trends.When you attend these events, you’ll be surrounded by the “buzz,” perfectly positioned to soak up knowledge.3.Listen to logistics podcasts\nPodcasts are an amazing tool for people with limited time on their hands.Are you the sort of person who always listens to music while you drive to work, cook dinner, or do yard work?Try swapping out your usual playlist for a logistics-focused podcast.We think our very own Unboxing Logistics is pretty cool!You can find it on YouTube\nopen_in_new\n, plus every major podcast platform.But there are lots of great options out there, so listen to a few and find the one(s) that you prefer.4.Read books and articles\nReading is still many people’s preferred way of learning.Get started by picking up a book that looks interesting or subscribing to a free online

Management\nopen_in_new\nInbound Logistics\nopen_in_new\nFreightWaves\nopen_in_new\n5.Put time on your calendar\nSometimes, it’s easiest to squeeze in learning in small doses during your everyday activities: listening to a podcast while you drive, reading an article during lunch, or pausing to read a social media post.But other times, it works best to set aside time to learn.Try putting a block of time on your calendar that’s dedicated to researching new shipping and logistics trends.With a dedicated time to dive deep, you’ll likely find some pretty cool things.Happy learning!Now that

Checkout Shipping Rates With ShipBlink and EasyPost\nJuly 11, 2022\nby EasyPost\nTweet\nShare\nWith live shipping rates, ecommerce shoppers can see the exact shipping cost for their order before they finalize their purchase–as opposed to a flat, static shipping rate.If you’re an ecommerce business, offering live shipping rates at checkout can be a great way to convert customers with a more seamless and accurate shopping experience.And with ShipBlink\nopen_in_new\n and EasyPost, it’s easier than ever to get started.What are live shipping rates?Live shipping rates are based on real-time data from carriers, meaning that the shipping cost for an order is calculated when the customer checks out.This is in contrast to a flat rate, which is a set price that does not change based on the weight or destination of an order.Offering live shipping rates can be beneficial for both customers and ecommerce businesses.Customers appreciate seeing the final cost of their order before they complete their purchase, which can lead to a more transparent shopping experience.And for businesses, live shipping rates can help reduce shipping costs by accurately calculating the cost of an order based on its weight and destination.ShipBlink is a live checkout shipping solution that integrates with EasyPost to provide live shipping rates at checkout.With ShipBlink, you can display live shipping rates from multiple carriers on your checkout page, so customers can choose the option that best meets their needs.And because ShipBlink is integrated with EasyPost, you can take advantage of our Shipping API to get real-time rates from over 100 carriers.How do live shipping rates work?Live shipping rates are calculated based on the dimensional weight of items in a customer’s cart and the shipping destination.Then, you’re connected to the carriers of your choice, who return a variety of rates for different transit times.Once you have live shipping rates, you can choose to display them at checkout or use them to calculate the shipping cost for an order.Showing live shipping rates at checkout can be a great way to provide customers with a more accurate estimate of the cost of their order.And using live shipping rates to calculate the shipping cost for an order can help businesses save money on shipping by ensuring that you’re only paying for the exact cost of shipping an order.This may sound technically complicated on the surface, but ShipBlink and EasyPost work together seamlessly to simplify this process for Shopify and BigCommerce users.Here’s how it works–on one end you have carriers with a variety of rates, and on the other end you have ShipBlink ready to connect with your online storefront.EasyPost is the middleman, acting as a bridge between both platforms to provide live shipping rates at checkout.Once selected, ShipBlink automatically assigns boxes to order items based on their dimensional weight–enabling you to split orders into multi-box shipments with a single click.Once the order is on its way, customers can view a custom-branded tracking page to get real-time updates on their shipment.How to get live shipping rates\nIf you’re using Shopify or BigCommerce, you can get live shipping rates powered by ShipBlink and EasyPost.First, connect your store from either BigCommerce\nopen_in_new\n or Shopify\nopen_in_new\n to Shipblink.Create an EasyPost account and add your API key to your Shipblink dashboard.Once all checkout settings are configured to your liking, you can start displaying live shipping rates at checkout and start using all that ShipBlink and EasyPost have to offer.It’s really that easy.And you don’t just have to take our word for it.Here’s an actual review from one of our users at RJWC Wholesale.This one actually delivers, for real.We use it for FedEx, DHL Express and UPS - It ticks all, ALL boxes.Commercial invoices are correct, packaging, labels, everything works as it should.It's a big scale product in a small scale package.And outstanding support and roadmap.We've been using it for BigCommerce and we will continue using it now that we migrate to Shopify Plus.What are the benefits of live shipping rates at checkout?Live shipping rates offer several benefits for both customers and ecommerce businesses.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"KMdwTOHxSX2p6kLah9vvBEzx7iejrXJoPwze61pOk/s="},"be95bc31-42ae-40c0-8bc2-d6f9f6fa6319":{"id_":"be95bc31-42ae-40c0-8bc2-d6f9f6fa6319","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-07-11-get-live-checkout-shipping-rates-with-shipblink-and-easypost"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e9d971f3-b8f2-44a1-9292-ec42af2db2be","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-07-11-get-live-checkout-shipping-rates-with-shipblink-and-easypost"},"hash":"wGj32M1zbtESrvFSBylSy2j7/15vTd3yuwksXfNEtH8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"67023846-abf7-4fd7-ad64-10b441fec6b5","metadata":{"url":"https://www.easypost.com/blog/2022-07-11-get-live-checkout-shipping-rates-with-shipblink-and-easypost"},"hash":"KMdwTOHxSX2p6kLah9vvBEzx7iejrXJoPwze61pOk/s="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"220ecfa0-ba15-4bfb-85de-10cc180cc298","metadata":{},"hash":"orYqgFgeI2mZMc0Yny9iYF43ERTQ+mPEvugktpqlof0="}},"text":"Create

rates at checkout?Live shipping rates offer several benefits for both customers and ecommerce businesses.Here are a few ways live shipping rates can help improve the checkout experience.Real-time rates\nOne of the main benefits of live shipping rates is that they are based on real-time data, which means that the shipping cost for an order is accurate.If you’re not using these dynamic rates, you risk customers being over or underpaying for shipping.By offering live shipping rates at checkout, you can provide customers with a more accurate estimate of the cost of their order without having to worry about taking a loss on shipping.Shipblink shows live shipping rates on the cart checkout page.With Smartbox Allocation, you can have real and accurate shipping rates, by automatically determining the best set of boxes required to quote rates.Multi-carrier opportunities\nAnother benefit of live shipping rates is that they open up the opportunity to use multiple carriers.If you combine multi-carrier shipping with live shipping rates, you can compare prices from different carriers in real-time and choose the best option for your customers and your business.This allows you to get the most competitive rates with the most reliable carriers and find the carrier that offers the best transit time for your customers.Increased automation\nOffering live shipping rates at checkout can also help increase automation across your business.For example, you no longer have to manually calculate the shipping cost for each order when using live shipping rates.This can free up time for you and your team to focus on other aspects of your business.In addition, an increase in automated technology helps reduce errors and makes it easier for you to keep track of shipping costs.How to get live shipping rates.Why choose ShipBlink and EasyPost?ShipBlink and EasyPost offer many advantages to ecommerce businesses that want access to live shipping rates.Here are a few reasons why you should consider using ShipBlink and EasyPost for your live shipping needs:\nIntegrate with 100+ shipping carriers\nShopify and BigCommerce integrations\nAutomatically assign boxes based on dim weight\nBranded tracking pages with real-time updates\nTo learn more about how ShipBlink and EasyPost can help your ecommerce business get live shipping rates at checkout, get in touch with one of
