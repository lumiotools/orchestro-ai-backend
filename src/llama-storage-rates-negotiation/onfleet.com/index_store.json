2021\nBlame it on Amazon, but your e-commerce logistics must be seamless, predictable, and lightning-fast if you want to stay in the game.Today’s customers take “fast and free” shipping as a given and expect online retailers to offer the same experiences as big name brands.Fortunately, brands of all sizes now have access to technology that allows them to streamline the entire logistics chain--from inventory planning to the last mile.In this article, we’ll break down everything you need to know about e-commerce logistics and what to look for when sizing up solutions.What is Ecommerce Logistics?E-commerce logistics is an end-to-end process that ensures online retailers can efficiently and reliably deliver packages to customers.As online shopping continues to explode, millions of packages are shipped across the country each day—as evidenced by the number of Amazon boxes (and vans) you’ll see walking around any neighborhood in the US.For online retailers, it’s critical to have a system that ensures every order lands in the arms of customers right on-time.To make that happen, businesses rely on integrated systems that allow them to manage all activities in one place, as well as AI, automation, and robots that help them keep up with otherwise impossible demands.E-commerce logistics must be embedded in every aspect of the business--not just digital fulfillment (inventory management, storage, and order processing).It needs to be integrated with all internal (customer-facing and back-office) and external operations.That includes the full network of vendors, carriers and warehouses you rely on to run your business.From Click to Customer: 5 Key Logistical Components\nYour logistics stack depends on several factors.Think: size, business model, distribution channels, locations, carriers, and so on.That said, every e-commerce logistics system must include the following five components:\nSuppliers\nThe first component is the suppliers you buy from.They might be manufacturers who make your products or vendors that provide raw materials, packaging, or parts.Suppliers ship items to your warehouse or distribution center when you place an order.While it’s a pretty straightforward idea, it’s important to understand that supplier management plays a key role in any e-commerce logistics strategy.Business leaders need to negotiate the best rates, bundle orders, and meet minimums.They also need to time their orders based on factors like customer demand, market conditions, and global events that could impact the supply chain.Fulfillment centers\nFulfillment centers are large warehouses that allow retailers to store inventory close to end-consumers.Rather than operating out of one central location, fulfillment centers make it easy to pick, pack, and ship orders to ensure fast delivery times.Fulfillment centers may be owned by the e-commerce business itself (think Amazon or Walmart) or a third-party logistics (3PL) service that performs warehousing and fulfillment services for several brands.Distribution centers\nUnlike fulfillment centers, which focus on getting orders to end-consumers, distribution centers receive, store, and distribute inventory to retail stores.If you sell to B2B accounts, distribution centers allow you to manage those orders in a separate location than your direct-to -consumer (DTC) orders.This is important because B2B orders require different fulfillment processes - they’re typically much larger, require different packaging, shipping arrangements, and warehousing.This separation allows brands to get orders to consumers faster and streamline operations on both sides of the business.Warehouse facilities\nWarehouses are used for storing and sorting finished goods.Unlike distribution and fulfillment centers, warehouses don’t typically handle order fulfillment, packaging, and delivery.Instead, e-commerce companies use warehouses to manage and control their inventory.Warehouses help companies match supply to consumer demand, store extra goods in case of emergency, and keep items secure and organized until it’s time to send them to distribution channels.Delivery operations\nDelivery operations refer to the methods you’ll use to transport orders.That includes trucking companies that move inventory from warehouses to fulfillment centers, in-house fleets, and large carriers like FedEx or UPS.Increasingly, we’re starting to see more companies embrace last mile operations like USPS handling, ad hoc delivery via gig economy apps, and even delivery drones/bots.With more ways to transport goods, brands need a system for managing different legs of the journey and choosing the carriers/methods based on factors like speed, costs, and impact on the environment.6 Ways to Improve Ecommerce Logistics\nImproving e-commerce logistics is an ongoing process that involves the entire supply chain.Here are six high-impact areas to work on:\n1.Distribute your inventory\nStoring all inventory in a single location might yield short-term savings, however, as you grow, it can have the opposite effect.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hztfTHbiOtlGPT3/36yl1Jn1fHDKZ+WgYkqTcfKVvXE="},"cb20775c-3db5-401c-8865-e739476f9fb5":{"id_":"cb20775c-3db5-401c-8865-e739476f9fb5","metadata":{"url":"https://onfleet.com/blog/ecommerce-logistics/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"d2b0d396-1e3f-4596-ae12-f3d7f5e4f5e5","metadata":{"url":"https://onfleet.com/blog/ecommerce-logistics/"},"hash":"+MG07RFOhZvijxVxmyBAgJHaUY0SOJiTW7vHwyEKK8U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d3306e6b-d4ae-4387-9ea0-441c479c3b79","metadata":{"url":"https://onfleet.com/blog/ecommerce-logistics/"},"hash":"hztfTHbiOtlGPT3/36yl1Jn1fHDKZ+WgYkqTcfKVvXE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d66ff980-d3df-4080-b4a1-16009cabd293","metadata":{},"hash":"Xktsj3lTpVF0nslMWlR3PLdwmrRB77/NdKdSWglPD4U="}},"text":"Delivery

your inventory\nStoring all inventory in a single location might yield short-term savings, however, as you grow, it can have the opposite effect.If you’re shipping everything from one location, you’ll either waste money on shipping or lose customers because they don’t want to wait 7-10 days for economy shipping.If you can’t afford to lease and staff more warehouse space or don’t have the expertise, you can cut costs and improve delivery times one option is using a third-party logistics (3PL) service.3PLs manage shipments, track inventory, and handle a wide range of fulfillment tasks.Plus, they often can negotiate better rates with carriers than individual retailers.2.Manage your inventory\nInventory management is a complex strategy.It’s not just about ordering, storing, and shipping products, it’s about looking at the big picture and balancing a bunch of different variables.Inventory management starts with complete visibility.That means, making sure that every location, department, and channel can communicate with one another and is working from the same set of data.This becomes especially important as your company grows and adds warehouses and fulfillment centers to keep pace with new demand.Avoid incorporating new elements on an ad-hoc basis.This can cause a disconnect between locations, departments, and functions.For instance, you might end up selling out-of-stock items or lose track of orders.Neither of which bode well for the customer experience.3.Optimize the last mile\nSolving the “last mile problem” goes a long way when it comes to improving e-commerce logistics overall.The last mile represents the final stretch of the journey that an order must travel to reach its destination.It’s the most expensive and time-consuming part of the logistics process and it also has a direct impact on the customer experience.Companies must invest in technology that increases efficiency and elevates the delivery experience to cut costs, increase margins, and capture a competitive edge.Here’s a quick look at some of the ways you can streamline the process:\nReduce delivery times\nImproving delivery efficiency starts with good data.It’s about making sure you have complete visibility into the entire logistics system.That includes driver and fleet availability, pending orders, where shipped orders are in-transit, etc.\nMake sure all data sources are synced and can exchange information in real-time.This makes it easy to adapt to last minute changes without causing bottlenecks or delays.Last mile software allows you to automate route planning.Onfleet's route planning brings fuel savings, improved ETAs, driver and customer satisfaction\nIf you’re using Onfleet, the platform analyzes factors like time, location, and traffic conditions against historical data to generate the most efficient route possible.What’s more, if there’s an accident, traffic jam, or a surprise storm, it automatically updates the route and alerts the driver.Onfleet also allows you to monitor driver performance and filter by team, driver, or a specific time.Capture and analyze customer feedback scores, success rate, distance, and the number of deliveries.These insights can then be used to help drivers improve—and further optimize route planning.Beyond that, it’s also about enabling drivers to move faster.Onfleet makes it easy for drivers to connect with customers, capture signatures, and document drop-offs--all from a single interface.Automated dispatch\nReduce dispatch costs\nAutomated dispatch can help you save money by reducing labor costs, service time, and inefficiencies.If you’re using a variety of carriers and last-mile solutions, automation can also ensure that you always use the most cost-effective delivery method.Onfleet allows you to set custom rules based on distance, driver availability, etc. Or, you can opt to have the platform do the work for you—optimizing routes, tasks, and speeds based on current conditions

dispatch\nReduce dispatch costs\nAutomated dispatch can help you save money by reducing labor costs, service time, and inefficiencies.If you’re using a variety of carriers and last-mile solutions, automation can also ensure that you always use the most cost-effective delivery method.Onfleet allows you to set custom rules based on distance, driver availability, etc. Or, you can opt to have the platform do the work for you—optimizing routes, tasks, and speeds based on current conditions and historical data.Connect with customers via delivery and messaging\nImprove the customer experience\nOn the customer side, the “last mile” describes what happens behind the scenes when a package is “out for delivery.”Unfortunately, that doesn’t tell customers when the driver will arrive.This moves from an inconvenience to a more complex problem when a package requires a signature or ID verification.What customers value in their delivery experience\nOnfleet brings more transparency to customers with features like automatic status updates, real-time driver tracking, and integrated customer communication that connects end-consumers with drivers and dispatchers with a single tap.The platform also allows organizations to capture feedback from individual customers and track performance against metrics like on-time rates, distance, success rates, and more.That way, brands can pinpoint exactly what areas they need to work on to improve the customer experience.Businesses can access a complete dashboard to manage all aspects of the last mile\nProvide contactless delivery options\nOnfleet’s Contactless Signatures is a new feature, launched in 2020 to keep drivers and recipients safe during COVID lockdowns.Customers and drivers can communicate via SMS, while real-time tracking lets recipients know when the driver is outside.Customers receive a link to a signature page, allowing drivers to complete the delivery without requiring the customer to come outside.Provide proof of delivery\nProof of delivery is a binding agreement between sender and recipient.It confirms the order reached its final destination in good condition, with all pieces present.Traditionally, proof of delivery was a manual process where the customer signed a form to confirm the delivery.Today, electronic proof-of-delivery is becoming the norm.Onfleet includes proof of delivery features that allow drivers to capture the information they need to complete the job.Proof of delivery can be confirmed with barcodes, photos, signatures and more\nBarcode scanning can confirm that the right package was delivered, while photo capture shows that the item was delivered to the right place.Drivers can also capture ID verification and electronic signatures, if needed.Ultimately, these features help brands protect themselves from false claims and legal liabilities without causing delays.4.Offer free (and fast) shipping\nCustomers not only want fast and free shipping, they expect it.Fast delivery requires retailers to have the right technology and processes in place.Think automating order routing and dispatching and using robotic process automation in the warehouse.It also means, you’ll need to build a data ecosystem that unifies all locations, departments, and activities involved in the process.The other half of the equation comes down to proximity.One of the key reasons Amazon can promise two-day turn-arounds is because they have distribution centers all over the world.5.Decentralized warehousing\nRather than fulfilling orders from a handful of regional distribution centers, retailers are looking toward smaller facilities located closer to population centers.Some brands convert physical retail space into shipping centers, while others set up dedicated mini-warehouses or fulfillment centers.Decentralized warehousing allows retailers to increase delivery speed and reduce costs.According to one recent study, decentralizing warehousing can reduce shipping costs by an estimated 25%.What’s more, it also reduces dependency on large 3PL companies, allowing you to work with regional carriers who can help you further reduce costs.6.Improve reverse logistics\nMore orders means more returns and you’ll need to get them picked up and processed as quickly as possible.That means, you’ll need to streamline your process for managing returns--often called “reverse logistics.”The idea there is, returns should be treated like a purchase in reverse--and approach the transaction with the same speed, accuracy, and care that goes into managing the actual purchase.Reverse logistics matter because they build customer confidence.You want to assure them that they won’t be stuck with a product that doesn’t meet their needs--and that they don’t need to jump through a bunch of hoops or pay hidden fees to make it happen.To improve this process, you’ll need to understand it.Make sure you can answer the following questions:\nWhat are the costs?How many times does the package change hands?Will you resell the items?Liquidate them?Do you charge restocking fees?You’ll also want to separate returns from order fulfillment to get them processed ASAP.4 Ecommerce

Will Shape 2022\nThe trends shaping the future of e-commerce logistics builds on what’s been happening over the past decade, combined with the many ways COVID changed the game.Consumers will expect faster delivery times\nAccording to Invespcro, 56% of customers between 18 and 35 expect same-day delivery.Faster delivery times can help brands improve loyalty, reduce cart abandonment, and increase upsells.But, in order to pull off the fast turn-around times customers expect, they’ll need to invest in upgrading their fulfillment strategies.In 2022, expect to see more companies embrace micro-warehousing solutions in urban areas.This will help e-commerce brands store products closer to end-users, speed up delivery times, and potentially, cut back on carbon emissions.Additionally, demand for 3PL services is expected to rise, as brands look for ways to streamline the logistics process without taking on more costs than they can handle.More companies will invest in last mile delivery\nInvestments in the global last mile delivery market are continuing to rise - with a projected 20% growth rate between 2020 and 2030.The explosion in last mile investment tracks with some of the broader e-commerce trends we’ve seen in recent years.Most notably, the increased pressure for brands to adapt to customer needs/market conditions in near real-time.But also, the fact that brands now compete on experience more than factors like price or product.And then of course, the pandemic placed a huge amount of pressure on the last mile delivery system.According to McKinsey, the US saw 10 years’ worth of growth within three months of the March 2020 outbreak—creating bottlenecks, delays, and higher delivery costs.Sustainability will have bigger impact on purchase decisions\nSustainability may seem at odds with the demand for fast delivery times and the continued rise of e-commerce.However, brands need to adapt more climate-friendly packaging and logistics solutions if they want to stick around for the long-haul.According to Capgemini research, 79% of customers are changing purchasing habits because of sustainability.Yet, 36% organizations say they believe customers will change habits based on environmental or social impact.Analysts warn that retailers that don’t address this gap could lose roughly 6% of revenue.E-commerce companies can improve their environmental impact in several different ways.Here are a few that come to mind:\nEmbracing circular economy practices\nPlanting trees to offset carbon emissions\nInvesting in electric vehicles\nDeveloping a program for reselling/recycling used merchandise\nReducing packaging\nSelling products that support sustainability\nPartnering with vendors/carriers that support sustainability\nConsumers will demand greater transparency during the delivery process\nThe June 2021 Edelman Trust Barometer declared that trust is the “New Brand Equity.”Researchers found that 68% of consumers say it’s more important that they can trust the brands they use today than in the past.While the trust conversation often centers on how brands use consumer data, transparency matters in the context of the supply chain, too.According to MIT Sloan, organizations should focus on the areas their customers care about most.The article uses the example of an organic grocery chain vs. a discount grocer.The organic chain might opt to disclose the individual farms they get their food from, as well as how that produce makes its way into stores.The discount retailer, by contrast, might be better off not sharing that information.Still, if there’s an e-coli outbreak, both chains need to be able to identify the source and share that information with customers.Transparency also needs to happen at the individual level.It’s no longer enough to send a shipping confirmation and vague status updates.Customers want more control over the delivery experience.Think: up-to-the-minute ETAs and the ability to reroute packages or correct a wrong address.This helps reduce the chances of a failed delivery attempt and improve the customer experience.Final Thoughts\nIf e-commerce logistics isn’t a top priority, the odds your business will survive are pretty grim.Customers don’t care if you’re a digital mom-and-pop or a massive enterprise.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pO4LiNALE0czRTIJtiup2LL40BFOSvIFdA5Q/CDZhfI="},"5672dfbc-1292-4e8a-abdd-5683bd004094":{"id_":"5672dfbc-1292-4e8a-abdd-5683bd004094","metadata":{"url":"https://onfleet.com/blog/ecommerce-logistics/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"d2b0d396-1e3f-4596-ae12-f3d7f5e4f5e5","metadata":{"url":"https://onfleet.com/blog/ecommerce-logistics/"},"hash":"+MG07RFOhZvijxVxmyBAgJHaUY0SOJiTW7vHwyEKK8U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"20c61a7f-0739-4737-89fc-d525c3aa3e5c","metadata":{"url":"https://onfleet.com/blog/ecommerce-logistics/"},"hash":"iMRQBVGTsg+Wf/bsNJ2+JaQubpWYX7YZDgGzElxW+4w="}},"text":"The

business landscape, efficient and cost-effective logistics are crucial for success.Did you know that logistics costs can account for up to 15% of a business's revenue?For small businesses and e-commerce companies, managing these costs effectively can be challenging.This article explores how carrier management software can become your saving grace, offering 10 powerful ways to streamline your operations and significantly reduce your shipping expenses.Within the intricate web of logistics, the adoption of technology has proven to be a game-changer, especially concerning cost savings.Carrier management software takes center stage by providing a centralized hub for businesses to coordinate and optimize their shipping operations.This technological integration replaces manual processes with automation, eliminating inefficiencies, reducing errors, and, most importantly, cutting down on costs.As we delve deeper into the narrative, we will uncover ten distinct ways in which carrier management software becomes the ally of cost-conscious businesses.Beyond operational efficiency, this software offers a strategic approach to navigating the complexities of logistics, ultimately contributing to enhanced visibility and a more robust bottom line.1.Optimized Carrier Selection\nIn the intricate web of logistics, the choice of carriers can significantly impact both operational efficiency and overall costs.Carrier management systems takes the guesswork out of this decision-making process by providing businesses with invaluable data-driven insights.Data-Driven Insights\nOne of the primary advantages of carrier management software is its ability to gather, analyze, and present comprehensive data related to various carriers.This data includes performance metrics, historical records, and real-time information, enabling businesses to make informed decisions based on tangible facts rather than assumptions.Rate and Service Comparison\nCarrier management software excels in its capability to compare rates and services across a spectrum of carriers.By consolidating this information in one central platform, businesses can efficiently evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different carriers based on their specific needs.This comparative analysis extends beyond just monetary considerations; it encompasses service quality, delivery times, and reliability, ensuring a holistic evaluation.Streamlining Decision-Making\nIn the absence of a carrier management system, businesses might find themselves grappling with a multitude of rate sheets, contract management, and service agreements.This software streamlines the decision-making process by presenting a clear, centralized view of available carriers and their offerings.This not only saves time but also reduces the likelihood of errors that can result from manual handling of complex carrier information.Dynamic Adaptation to Changes\nThe logistics landscape is ever-evolving, with fluctuations in carrier performance, rates, and market conditions.Carrier management software continuously updates its data, allowing businesses to dynamically adapt to these changes.This adaptability ensures that the selected carriers remain the most cost-effective options, even in the face of shifting market dynamics.Optimized carrier selection through transportation management software empowers businesses to make decisions grounded in data, promoting cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency.By comparing rates and services comprehensively, businesses can align their logistics strategy with their financial goals, setting the stage for enhanced performance and reduced costs.2.Enhanced Negotiation Capabilities\nIn the intricate dance of logistics, effective negotiation with carriers can significantly impact a business's bottom line.Carrier management software steps into this arena, equipping businesses with advanced tools and analytics to enhance their negotiation capabilities.Utilizing Software Analytics\nTransportation management systems employ sophisticated analytics to provide businesses with actionable insights during negotiations.By analyzing historical data, market trends, and carrier performance metrics, the software identifies optimal negotiation points.Armed with this information, businesses can enter negotiations with a clear understanding of market rates, carrier performance, and potential cost-saving opportunities.Strategic Rate Negotiations\nNegotiating better rates with carriers is not just about driving costs down; it's about striking a balance between cost efficiency and service quality.Carrier management systems aid businesses in formulating a strategic negotiation approach.The software's analytics can identify areas where concessions can be made without compromising service levels, fostering a collaborative relationship with carriers.Tracking Performance Data\nThe ability to negotiate effectively is rooted in concrete data.Carrier management software serves as a repository of performance data for each carrier, ranging from on-time deliveries to incident reports.Businesses can leverage this information as negotiating leverage, encouraging carriers to uphold or improve their service standards in exchange for continued partnership.Real-Time Performance Monitoring\nNegotiation isn't a one-time event; it's an ongoing process.Carrier management software provides real-time monitoring of carrier performance, allowing businesses to assess whether negotiated terms are being met.If discrepancies arise, businesses can proactively address issues during the contract period, fostering accountability and ensuring that negotiated benefits are consistently delivered.Cost-Effective Partnerships\nUltimately, enhanced negotiation capabilities through carrier management software pave the way for cost-effective partnerships.Businesses can secure favorable terms, optimize service levels, and foster collaborative relationships with carriers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"oB88bbBNZOhcerISqtqNikyFKLZJ0sKknbR053S/Uu0="},"c4e1f366-e336-4e16-9c82-1a6f7a631b32":{"id_":"c4e1f366-e336-4e16-9c82-1a6f7a631b32","metadata":{"url":"https://onfleet.com/blog/carrier-management-software-helps-you-save-money/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"49362c95-d642-4f3a-86f1-adff3a094d3b","metadata":{"url":"https://onfleet.com/blog/carrier-management-software-helps-you-save-money/"},"hash":"bNU9J1CLvFFjykC45CLw7nD4tgDcP4PqKUlLpYrG1eY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1e7e07a8-4633-4889-b797-cf0816c16825","metadata":{"url":"https://onfleet.com/blog/carrier-management-software-helps-you-save-money/"},"hash":"oB88bbBNZOhcerISqtqNikyFKLZJ0sKknbR053S/Uu0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"385ebe1e-8311-4d6e-866f-37e86d2aa50f","metadata":{},"hash":"AnAhQZTQdGxA85/OqfXR6LxfI6xFENzZk1RmBE7J46E="}},"text":"The

operational excellence.Carrier management systems empower businesses to go beyond conventional negotiation tactics.By leveraging analytics and performance data, businesses can navigate negotiations strategically, securing favorable terms that align with their financial goals and operational requirements.This dynamic approach not only fosters cost-effective partnerships but also positions businesses for sustained success in the ever-evolving logistics landscape.3.Reduced Administrative Costs\nIn the realm of logistics, administrative tasks can be both time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to increased costs.Carrier management systems emerge as a catalyst for efficiency, significantly reducing administrative burdens through the seamless automation of critical processes.Automation of Paperwork, Billing, and Proof of Delivery\nCarrier management software acts as a digital maestro, orchestrating the automation of paperwork, billing, and proof of delivery processes.Traditionally manual and paper-intensive, these tasks are streamlined and expedited through the software's automated workflows.From generating shipping documents to invoicing and managing proof of delivery, the software ensures that these processes are not only efficient but also error-free.Minimizing Manual Errors\nManual errors in administrative tasks can be costly, leading to billing discrepancies, delivery delays, and other operational hiccups.Carrier management software significantly minimizes the risk of human error by automating repetitive tasks.This not only enhances accuracy but also frees up valuable human resources to focus on more strategic aspects of logistics management.Administrative Overhead Reduction\nThe overhead costs associated with manual administrative tasks, such as data entry and document processing, can be substantial.A carrier management system slashes this administrative overhead by automating these tasks, reducing the need for extensive manpower and mitigating the associated costs.This cost reduction allows businesses to allocate resources more efficiently, directing them towards activities that contribute directly to their core objectives.Real-Time Tracking and Reporting\nIn addition to automation, carrier management software offers real-time tracking and reporting features.This transparency enables businesses to monitor administrative processes as they unfold, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions to optimize workflows further.Real-time insights empower businesses to proactively address any issues, preventing them from escalating into costly challenges.Efficiency, Accuracy, and Cost Savings:\nThe collective impact of automating administrative processes through carrier management software is a trifecta of efficiency, accuracy, and how to reduce cost.Businesses can operate with a leaner administrative structure, reducing the time and resources traditionally allocated to paperwork-intensive tasks.This streamlined approach not only enhances overall efficiency but also contributes significantly to the reduction of administrative costs.In summary, carrier management systems stand as a beacon for businesses seeking to minimize administrative costs.Through the automation of paperwork, billing, and proof of delivery processes, this technology not only boosts operational efficiency but also positions businesses to operate with greater precision, ensuring reduced costs and a more streamlined logistics operation.4.Improved Route Efficiency\nIn the intricate tapestry of logistics, the optimization of routes stands as a critical factor influencing both operational costs and customer satisfaction.Carrier management software emerges as a key player, introducing dynamic route planning features that not only reduce fuel and maintenance costs but also enhance delivery times and overall customer satisfaction.Dynamic Route Planning Features\nCarrier management software revolutionizes route planning by introducing dynamic features that adapt to real-time conditions.Instead of relying on static, predetermined routes, businesses can leverage the software's dynamic capabilities to consider variables such as traffic, weather, and road closures.This adaptive approach ensures that routes are not only efficient but also responsive to the ever-changing conditions on the road.Reduction in Fuel and Maintenance Costs\nOptimizing routes through a carrier management system translates directly into fuel efficiency.By identifying the most direct and economical paths, businesses can reduce fuel consumption, subsequently lowering fuel costs and minimizing the environmental impact of transportation operations.Additionally, efficient routes contribute to lower wear and tear on vehicles, leading to decreased maintenance costs over time.Impact on Delivery Times\nEfficient route planning is synonymous with timely

2024\nGeekflare articles are written by humans for humans.Michal Vojtech\nContributor\nIn the landscape of technology platforms of the future, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prominent.It continues to revolutionize various industries and transform the way we live and work.I witness this remarkable shift from the first-row seats of transformative technology delivery, and I find myself continuously surprised by the immense potential AI holds in technology delivery management.With each passing day, AI continues to redefine the boundaries of what is possible, empowering businesses to streamline their operations and deliver interesting results.The benefits go from optimizing wide areas of company processes and resource allocation to automating repetitive tasks.It goes as far as even predicting potential bottlenecks.AI has already proven to be an important asset in driving the success of companies.Unleashing AI’s Potential in Technology Delivery Management\nOne of AI’s biggest advantages is its ability to analyze large amounts of data very quickly.AI also uses machine learning algorithms to extract insights from complex datasets.Companies can make significant decisions based on that data.With AI implemented into the system platform, they have a powerful tool to proactively identify and mitigate risks during the project timeline.Predictive Insights Powered by AI and Data Lakes\nAI’s predictive capabilities have redefined the way you might approach (any kind of) resource allocation.For example, let’s imagine you have only a limited amount of people capable of servicing your device infrastructure.However, the infrastructure itself is exceptionally complex (it can cover multiple countries).Then you need to decide well where the people will be sent for maintenance if you want to ensure reliable infrastructure operation.In some cases, you need to fulfill government regulations regarding the reliability of your assets, which restricts you even further.This is where data lake with AI comes into play.AI generates large amounts of data in real-time and creates organized structures called data lakes.Data lake is the ultimate source of truth for any predictions or conclusions.You can let AI analyze this data lake and historical data and patterns inside.The result of that is the exact forecast of where to send service resources at which time.Such usage of data lake, of course, reduces the costs of people’s work but also ensures that the right resources are available at the right time.Collaborative Synergy: Humans and AI in Harmony\nIt is important to note that AI is not meant to replace human expertise.You still need to implement the back door into your system so that you can easily verify and correct the results of such AI processing.The cooperation between humans and AI is still needed.AI might excel at processing large amounts of data, but it completely lacks human intuition and creativity\nThe collaboration between humans and AI creates a balance where each complements the strengths of the other.Revolutionizing Utility Infrastructure Maintenance with AI\nLet’s stay with our electricity utility infrastructure case.Maintaining such infrastructure is a critical task that covers the smooth functioning of several devices on each electricity pole, and you can have potentially thousands of such poles.Fortunately, the convergence of drone photography and AI machine learning models that are now possible to implement inside software solutions and processes has opened up new possibilities, changing forever the way we approach utility infrastructure maintenance.Drones equipped with high-resolution cameras can capture detailed images of utility infrastructure at any time during the day, including power lines, pipelines, and communication towers.These photographs provide a comprehensive view of the infrastructure, allowing for a more accurate assessment of its condition.You can leverage AI machine learning models to analyze and process the pictures to extract valuable insights, leading to improved maintenance practices.Detecting Anomalies and Predicting Problems with AI\nA key advantage of using machine learning models with drone photography is they can reliably detect and predict potential issues coming from the devices in the pictures.Sure, a dedicated, trained person would do just that as well, but not in such a short time.The only thing you need to do is to make sure you have well-trained machine-learning models.For example, the models can detect signs of corrosion or structural damage.If your software platform can identify these issues early on, maintenance teams can take proactive measures to address them soon.Creating Digital Twins for Real-time Infrastructure Monitoring\nThe benefit of combining drone photography with AI is the ability to create a digital twin of the utility infrastructure.You can generate a digital replica of the infrastructure by continuously capturing images and feeding them into the AI models.This virtual representation provides a real-time view of the infrastructure’s condition.It allows the maintenance teams to monitor changes and plan maintenance activities more effectively.The digital twin also serves as a valuable resource for training AI models further, enhancing their accuracy and predictive capabilities over time.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"EJmpHsgVrOteDqHQMHca0DtY58fNwWugPlBcrs97azM="},"c948ceb0-5a20-4657-a1d8-0a6df4eb7844":{"id_":"c948ceb0-5a20-4657-a1d8-0a6df4eb7844","metadata":{"url":"https://geekflare.com/artificial-intelligence-technology-delivery-management/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"3203bc76-e18f-435e-aa8f-d0a33fec88a1","metadata":{"url":"https://geekflare.com/artificial-intelligence-technology-delivery-management/"},"hash":"p/up+e4AxGHMUbs/NRxXgPil5Y60mCYiaiGrL7lGZV4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"df0c18e2-6449-487b-bf74-dddd23bf1215","metadata":{"url":"https://geekflare.com/artificial-intelligence-technology-delivery-management/"},"hash":"EJmpHsgVrOteDqHQMHca0DtY58fNwWugPlBcrs97azM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"046e2c2b-5603-4a0f-b46b-d638528a1f83","metadata":{},"hash":"CgtS1bEBlxFpxlXVzQIV1tb0+B7dmSdp2hXfOg/w+bI="}},"text":"Sure,

executed, and managed.Here are some key impacts of such AI implementation that you can notice in your case as well.Enhanced Efficiency\nIf you happen to have many repetitive and time-consuming tasks in your software processes, AI automatizes that and allows teams to focus on more complex and strategic activities instead.This alone leads to increased efficiency and productivity in your processes.Well-trained AI algorithms can analyze your data on the backside and identify repeating patterns.Then, AI uses them to make predictions going forward.Improved Accuracy\nAI algorithms can process and analyze data with a high level of accuracy.In the case of machine learning model processing, we speak here about the probability of 99% and higher that the conclusions AI makes are correct.This level of accuracy is already possible today.This reduces the chances of human error and improves the overall quality of technology delivery.Streamlining Project Management with AI\nThe implementation of AI also streamlines project management by automating various processes.Today, you will find many project management software tools with native support of AI in different forms.We don’t need to go too far away and just take Microsoft Outlook or Edge as an example.ChatGPT input is already there and ready to use.AI really can today assist in project planning and scheduling.Proactively Identifying Issues in Tech Delivery with AI\nWhat about proactive detecting and predicting potential issues or bottlenecks in technology delivery processes?Yes, AI can do that as well.By analyzing data, AI can alert teams to potential risks.This helps prevent delays and ensures smooth project execution.Data-Driven Decision-Making in Technology Delivery\nYou can make much easier data-driven decisions by involving AI implementation in your technology platform.First, AI quickly generates a large amount of data, which would be quite useless if there were no effective way how to analyze it quickly.But AI algorithms can extract valuable insights fast and provide actionable recommendations.Achieving Continuous Improvement with AI\nAI implementation gives you the possibility of continuous learning and improvement.AI algorithms can analyze historical data and adapt to changing circumstances.This can help you to refine processes and enhance overall performance in technology delivery.Implementing AI: Step-by-Step\nLet’s try to answer now the question of what’s the best way to approach such implementation.Say, if you are just about to start with all that.It can be overwhelming and confusing.Here is a simple guidance for you to narrow the chaos into some clear concentration points.#1.Identify the Use Case\nStart with identifying specific use cases within the project where AI models can add value.Work with the project team to understand their pain points and areas where AI can provide insights or automate tasks.Only by focusing on specific use cases
