By partnering with the right freight carriers, you can not only save money but also ensure smoother operations and happier customers. Here are six important considerations to help you optimize your carrier network with empathy in mind:\\n\\nCarrier Network Size: Use at least three carriers for backup, ensuring resilience during unexpected events like pandemics or natural disasters. An extensive network allows selective matching of carriers to shipments, enhancing cost-effectiveness.\\n\\nReliability and Speed: Assess carrier reliability by region, product type, and service level using available data. Utilize data to identify underperforming carriers and enhance shipping decisions for higher profits.\\n\\nScalability: Introduce new carriers into your network to expand customer reach, especially as eCommerce activity increases. Ensure consistent high-level service for customers in new areas.\\n\\nCustomer Service: Choose carriers that provide excellent customer service, as delivery impacts your brand. Consider carriers offering specialty services like #WhiteGlove for an enhanced customer experience.\\n\\nShipping Rates: Leverage volume to secure competitive nationwide rates across multiple carriers. Save on shipping costs by using tools like #FreightClub for preferential rates across up to 50 carriers.\\n\\nClaims Payouts: Partner with carriers offering prompt and high-percentage claims payouts to reduce risk. Evaluate carriers based on their coverage of concealed damages and adjudication time.\\n\\nChoosing the right freight carriers involves leveraging insights and data.

Shipping protection acts as a safeguard against potential financial losses caused by damaged or lost items. By investing in shipping protection, furniture sellers can minimize the impact on their bottom line, ensuring that they are compensated for any unforeseen shipping incidents.\\n\\nEnhance Customer Satisfaction:\\nProviding shipping protection adds an extra layer of security for customers purchasing furniture. In the event of damage during shipping, customers can rest assured that they are protected, leading to increased satisfaction and trust in the seller. Happy customers are more likely to become repeat buyers and recommend the seller to others, contributing to long-term business success.\\n\\nCompetitive Advantage:\\nOffering shipping protection sets furniture sellers apart from competitors who may not provide such coverage. In a competitive market, the assurance of protection during transit can be a deciding factor for customers choosing where to make their purchase. This additional service can be a valuable selling point and contribute to the overall positive perception of the seller's brand.\\n\\nIn summary, shipping protection for furniture sellers is a proactive approach to mitigate financial risks, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive edge in the market. It's an investment that not only protects the seller's interests but also contributes to the overall positive customer experience.\\n\\n#Shipping #Furniture #Logistics #FreightClubKnowsLTL\\n6\\n6\\nFreight Club\\n@Freight Club\\n9 months ago\\nAs the eCommerce furniture industry continues its upward trajectory, the spotlight on efficient and customer-centric freight shipping has never been brighter.

This includes everything from food at a restaurant to your online order arriving on time. \\nChoosing the best shipping platform per your product requirements is critical to competing with companies offering next-day or even same-day shipping services.\\nFactors to Consider While Choosing a Shipping Platform\\nShipping is one of the major building blocks of your eCommerce business, and choosing the right platform can be challenging. You must find the best fit for your business even among the top-notch shipping platforms. Consider the following factors when choosing a platform:\\nQuote Comparison\\nCost plays a huge role in many business decisions, so this should be a priority. Does the shipping platform offer quotes from various carriers? Do they provide a reliable network of carriers? \\nChoose a shipping platform that offers enterprise shipping rates from a wide range of reliable carriers. Often, SMBs find it hard to get discounted rates as enterprises do. A few shipping platforms offer enterprise rates to small to medium businesses. Do keen research before deciding on a shipping platform.\\nCustomer Service\\nCustomer service provided by the shipping platform impacts your operations and overall experience. Personalized support from a dedicated team of experts is ideal. \\nThis is especially important for insurance purposes. Handling claims and insurance can be complex, time-consuming, and requires strong attention to detail. A shipping platform that offers assistance to file claims and deals with carriers on your behalf can help make your shipping process simple. Ensure you partner with a shipping platform that provides expertise and experience in customer service and after-shipping solutions – it is crucial to keep your business running smoothly.\\nTracking and Monitoring\\nLook into the tracking capabilities and monitoring services offered. Tracking is essential for customers to follow their package along its journey. You want complete visibility at all times. \\nRegularly updated tracking information is key to a good customer experience. It helps build trust and loyalty to your business.\\nSpecialization \\nDepending on what you offer, you may need special shipping services. For example, white-glove delivery service is the best option if you are shipping delicate products like medical equipment requiring special care and assembly services. If you need special services, choose a platform with plenty of options for delivery services. \\nDelivery Service\\nDeliver speed and range are two crucial factors. Delivery speed is essential to your customers as they want their purchases as soon as possible. \\nThe delivery range is essential to your business as you want to reach as many customers as possible. Ensure you partner with a shipping platform that offers its services where your customers need them.\\nAPI Integration\\nLastly, check what integrations they offer. If you’re already using platforms and services for other business areas, the more you can integrate, the better. \\nBenefits of Partnering with a Shipping Platform\\nOnce you find the best shipping platform for your business, you’ll enjoy many benefits. \\nPeace of Mind\\nWhen you partner with a good-quality shipping platform, you can have automatic confidence in all carriers. \\nThey pre-vet everyone and make sure they only offer you the best services. Your goods are in trusted hands, and you know you’re always getting competitive pricing. \\nBetter Experience\\nUsing a shipping platform offers everyone a better experience. Your work will be seamless as you enjoy on-demand tracking and easy access to all services. \\nIt also gives your customers a better experience as every facet of your business is organized. This means fewer service interruptions for them. \\nTotal Visibility \\nYou can watch and track every aspect of the shipping journey in one place. In-depth metrics and analytics give you premium insight into the success of your process. This transparency allows you to spot trends, patterns, and weak spots. \\nBetter Reach\\nWhen you have multiple carriers to choose from, you can reach more customers without issue.

By partnering with the right freight carriers, you can not only save money but also ensure smoother operations and happier customers. Here are six important considerations to help you optimize your carrier network with empathy in mind:\\n\\nCarrier Network Size: Use at least three carriers for backup, ensuring resilience during unexpected events like pandemics or natural disasters. An extensive network allows selective matching of carriers to shipments, enhancing cost-effectiveness.\\n\\nReliability and Speed: Assess carrier reliability by region, product type, and service level using available data. Utilize data to identify underperforming carriers and enhance shipping decisions for higher profits.\\n\\nScalability: Introduce new carriers into your network to expand customer reach, especially as eCommerce activity increases. Ensure consistent high-level service for customers in new areas.\\n\\nCustomer Service: Choose carriers that provide excellent customer service, as delivery impacts your brand. Consider carriers offering specialty services like #WhiteGlove for an enhanced customer experience.\\n\\nShipping Rates: Leverage volume to secure competitive nationwide rates across multiple carriers. Save on shipping costs by using tools like #FreightClub for preferential rates across up to 50 carriers.\\n\\nClaims Payouts: Partner with carriers offering prompt and high-percentage claims payouts to reduce risk. Evaluate carriers based on their coverage of concealed damages and adjudication time.\\n\\nChoosing the right freight carriers involves leveraging insights and data. Freight Club utilizes years of data to help you make informed shipping decisions, providing control over the process from quoting to tracking and claims management.\\n\\n#Shipping #Logistics #eCommerce #FreightClubknowsLTL\\n5\\n5\\nFreight Club\\n@Freight Club\\n9 months ago\\nFreight Club is your ultimate solution for efficient big and bulky product shipping!

Shipping protection acts as a safeguard against potential financial losses caused by damaged or lost items. By investing in shipping protection, furniture sellers can minimize the impact on their bottom line, ensuring that they are compensated for any unforeseen shipping incidents.\\n\\nEnhance Customer Satisfaction:\\nProviding shipping protection adds an extra layer of security for customers purchasing furniture. In the event of damage during shipping, customers can rest assured that they are protected, leading to increased satisfaction and trust in the seller. Happy customers are more likely to become repeat buyers and recommend the seller to others, contributing to long-term business success.\\n\\nCompetitive Advantage:\\nOffering shipping protection sets furniture sellers apart from competitors who may not provide such coverage. In a competitive market, the assurance of protection during transit can be a deciding factor for customers choosing where to make their purchase. This additional service can be a valuable selling point and contribute to the overall positive perception of the seller's brand.\\n\\nIn summary, shipping protection for furniture sellers is a proactive approach to mitigate financial risks, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive edge in the market. It's an investment that not only protects the seller's interests but also contributes to the overall positive customer experience.\\n\\n#Shipping #Furniture #Logistics #FreightClubKnowsLTL\\n6\\n6\\nFreight Club\\n@Freight Club\\n9 months ago\\nAs the eCommerce furniture industry continues its upward trajectory, the spotlight on efficient and customer-centric freight shipping has never been brighter.

offering specialty services like #WhiteGlove for an enhanced customer experience.Shipping Rates: Leverage volume to secure competitive nationwide rates across multiple carriers.Save on shipping costs by using tools like #FreightClub for preferential rates across up to 50 carriers.Claims Payouts: Partner with carriers offering prompt and high-percentage claims payouts to reduce risk.Evaluate carriers based on their coverage of concealed damages and adjudication time.Choosing the right freight carriers involves leveraging insights and data.Freight Club utilizes years of data to help you

cost-effective and efficient experience.In this blog, we’ve compiled a list of pointers to help guide your decision-making as you explore LTL services.#LTLshipping #Freight #Logistics #FreightClubKnowsLTL\\n9\\n9\\nFreight Club\\n@Freight Club\\n9 months ago\\nShipping protection is crucial for furniture sellers, and here are three compelling reasons why they should prioritize it:\\n\\nMinimize Financial Losses:\\nFurniture items are often valuable and can be susceptible to damage during the shipping process.Shipping protection acts as a safeguard against potential financial losses caused by damaged or lost items.By investing in shipping protection, furniture sellers can minimize the impact on their bottom line, ensuring that they are compensated for any unforeseen shipping incidents.Enhance Customer Satisfaction:\\nProviding shipping protection adds an extra layer of security for customers purchasing furniture.In the event of damage during shipping, customers can rest assured that they are protected, leading to increased satisfaction and trust in the seller.Happy customers are more likely to become repeat buyers and recommend the seller to others, contributing to long-term business success.Competitive Advantage:\\nOffering shipping protection sets furniture sellers apart from competitors who may not provide such coverage.In a competitive market, the assurance of protection during transit can be a deciding factor for customers choosing where to make their purchase.This additional service can be a valuable selling point and contribute to the overall positive perception of the seller's brand.In summary, shipping protection for furniture sellers is a proactive approach to mitigate financial risks, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive edge in the market.It's an investment that not only protects the seller's interests but also contributes to the overall positive customer experience.#Shipping

service.This includes everything from food at a restaurant to your online order arriving on time.Choosing the best shipping platform per your product requirements is critical to competing with companies offering next-day or even same-day shipping services.Factors to Consider While Choosing a Shipping Platform\\nShipping is one of the major building blocks of your eCommerce business, and choosing the right platform can be challenging.You must find the best fit for your business even among the top-notch shipping platforms.Consider the following factors when choosing a platform:\\nQuote Comparison\\nCost plays a huge role in many business decisions, so this should be a priority.Does the shipping platform offer quotes from various carriers?Do they provide a reliable network of carriers?Choose a shipping platform that offers enterprise shipping rates from a wide range of reliable carriers.Often, SMBs find it hard to get discounted rates as enterprises do.A few shipping platforms offer enterprise rates to small to medium businesses.Do keen research before deciding on a shipping platform.Customer Service\\nCustomer service provided by the shipping platform impacts your operations and overall experience.Personalized support from a dedicated team of experts is ideal.This is especially important for insurance purposes.Handling claims and insurance can be complex, time-consuming, and requires strong attention to detail.A shipping platform that offers assistance to file claims and deals with carriers on your behalf can help make your shipping process simple.Ensure you partner with a shipping platform that provides expertise and experience in customer service and after-shipping solutions – it is crucial to keep your business running smoothly.Tracking and Monitoring\\nLook into the tracking capabilities and monitoring services offered.Tracking is essential for customers to follow their package along its journey.You want complete visibility at all times.Regularly updated tracking information is key to a good customer experience.It helps build trust and loyalty to your business.Specialization \\nDepending on what you offer, you may need special shipping services.For example, white-glove delivery service is the best option if you are shipping delicate products like medical equipment requiring special care and assembly services.If you need special services, choose a platform with plenty of options for delivery services.Delivery Service\\nDeliver speed and range are two crucial factors.Delivery speed is essential to your customers as they want their purchases as soon as possible.The delivery range is essential to your business as you want to reach as many customers as possible.Ensure you partner with a shipping platform that offers its services where your customers need them.API Integration\\nLastly, check what integrations they offer.If you’re already using platforms and services for other business areas, the more you can integrate, the better.Benefits of Partnering with a Shipping Platform\\nOnce you find the best shipping platform for your business, you’ll enjoy many benefits.Peace of Mind\\nWhen you partner with a good-quality shipping platform, you can have automatic confidence in all carriers.They pre-vet everyone and make sure they only offer you the best services.Your goods are in trusted

businesses strive for, and it's understandable why.By partnering with the right freight carriers, you can not only save money but also ensure smoother operations and happier customers.Here are six important considerations to help you optimize your carrier network with empathy in mind:\\n\\nCarrier Network Size: Use at least three carriers for backup, ensuring resilience during unexpected events like pandemics or natural disasters.An extensive network allows selective matching of carriers to shipments, enhancing cost-effectiveness.Reliability and Speed: Assess carrier reliability by region, product type, and service level using available data.Utilize data to identify underperforming carriers and enhance shipping decisions for higher profits.Scalability: Introduce new carriers into your network to expand customer reach, especially as eCommerce activity increases.Ensure consistent high-level service for customers in new areas.Customer Service: Choose carriers that provide excellent customer service, as delivery impacts your brand.Consider carriers offering specialty services like #WhiteGlove for an enhanced customer experience.Shipping Rates: Leverage volume to secure competitive nationwide rates across multiple carriers.Save on shipping costs by using tools like #FreightClub for preferential rates across up to 50 carriers.Claims Payouts: Partner with carriers offering prompt and high-percentage claims payouts to reduce risk.Evaluate carriers based on their coverage of concealed damages and adjudication time.Choosing the right freight carriers involves leveraging insights and data.Freight Club utilizes years of data to help you make informed shipping decisions, providing control over the process from quoting to tracking and claims

Losses:\\nFurniture items are often valuable and can be susceptible to damage during the shipping process.Shipping protection acts as a safeguard against potential financial losses caused by damaged or lost items.By investing in shipping protection, furniture sellers can minimize the impact on their bottom line, ensuring that they are compensated for any unforeseen shipping incidents.Enhance Customer Satisfaction:\\nProviding shipping protection adds an extra layer of security for customers purchasing furniture.In the event of damage during shipping, customers can rest assured that they are protected, leading to increased satisfaction and trust in the seller.Happy customers are more likely to become repeat buyers and recommend the seller to others, contributing to long-term business success.Competitive Advantage:\\nOffering shipping protection sets furniture sellers apart from competitors who may not provide such coverage.In a competitive market, the assurance of protection during transit can be a deciding factor for customers choosing where to make their purchase.This additional service can be a valuable selling point and contribute to the overall positive perception of the seller's brand.In summary, shipping protection for furniture sellers is a proactive approach to mitigate financial risks, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive edge in the market.It's an investment that not only protects the seller's interests but also contributes to the overall positive customer experience.#Shipping #Furniture #Logistics

expenses, making carrier selection crucial.Here are six key factors to determine the effectiveness of a freight carrier network:\\n\\nNetwork Size: Having at least three carriers ensures reliability, especially during unexpected events or carrier issues, allowing better matching of carriers to shipments for optimal pricing and lower damage rates.Reliability and Speed: Assess carriers' reliability and speed by region, product type, and service level using available data to identify underperforming carriers.Reliable carriers contribute to higher profits by reducing claims handling costs and customer dissatisfaction.Scalability: Evaluate if your carrier network allows scalability, especially with the growing eCommerce market.Introducing new carriers in areas of expansion ensures a consistent positive customer experience.Customer Service: Delivery service is an extension of your brand, and carriers play a crucial role.Consider specialty services like White Glove for large items such as furniture to enhance the overall customer experience.Shipping Rates: Assess if you can obtain competitive rates from carriers for shipping regionally or nationwide.With Freight Club, customers can access enterprise rates from 40+ LTL carriers for shipping across the U.S.Claims Management: Claims can lead to potential losses.Partner with carriers offering high percentage and prompt claims

expenses.1 But don’t fret!We’ve got your back with 10 genius hacks to slash those costs.These tips will transform your shipping game.3 Ready to save big?KEY TAKEAWAYS\\nSmall businesses can lose up to 25% of revenue to shipping costs, but smart strategies can slash expenses.Comparing carriers like USPS (54% market share), UPS (47.7%), and FedEx (37.3%) helps find the best rates and services for your needs.Optimizing packaging size and materials can prevent damage and reduce dimensional weight charges from carriers.Shipping software and automation tools boost efficiency, with some users seeing a 16% increase in average order value.Offering free shipping on orders 30% above your average sale value can increase conversions, as 85% of customers prioritize free shipping.TABLE OF CONTENTS\\nEXPLORING SHIPPING COSTS AND OPTIONS\\nShipping costs can make or break your small biz.It’s time to get smart about your options!Dig into different carriers and compare their speeds and prices – you might be surprised at what you find.RESEARCH VARIOUS CARRIERS\\nPicking the right carrier can make or break your shipping game.Let’s dive into how to research carriers and find your perfect match.Compare rates: Use multi-carrier calculators to check prices across USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DHL.USPS leads with 54% market share, followed by UPS at 47.7%, and FedEx at 37.3%.2\\nSpeed matters: Look at delivery times for each service level.Some offer same-day delivery, while others might take a few days.Track record: Check carrier reliability.A reputable carrier like Couriers Atlanta might have better on-time delivery stats than others.Special services: See if carriers offer extras like Saturday delivery or signature confirmation.These can be game-changers for your biz.Tech tools: Look for carriers with user-friendly websites and shipping software.Good tech can save you tons of time and headaches.1\\nCoverage areas: Make sure your chosen carrier reaches all your customers.DHL, with 5.7% U.S.market share, might be great for international shipping.Hidden fees: Watch out for surcharges on fuel, residential delivery, or oversized packages.These can add up fast!Customer service: Test each carrier’s support.You’ll want help when things go wrong…and they will, trust me.Packaging options: Some carriers offer free boxes or flat-rate options.This can be a huge money-saver for small businesses.Pickup services: Check if carriers will grab packages from your location.This can be a real time-saver, especially as you grow.COMPARE SERVICE SPEEDS AND PRICES\\nAfter scoping out carriers, it’s time to dive into the nitty-gritty.Let’s break down service speeds and prices – the real meat and potatoes of shipping decisions.4\\nCarrier Service Speed Price Range Notes\\nUSPS First Class Mail 1-3 business days $ Best for packages under 16 oz\\nUSPS Priority Mail 1-3 business days $$ Up to $50 insurance included\\nUSPS Priority Mail Express Overnight to 2 days $$$ Up to $100 insurance included\\nUPS Ground 1-5 business days $$ Flat rate boxes up to 70 lbs\\nFedEx Ground 1-5 business days $$ One Rate boxes up to 50 lbs\\nPro tip: Mix and match services based on package weight and delivery urgency.USPS First Class Mail is a steal for light packages, while flat rate options from UPS or FedEx can be gold for heavier items.3 Keep your shipping costs to 15-20% of total revenue to stay in the green.Happy shipping, geeks!DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE SHIPPING STRATEGIES\\nCrafting a killer shipping strategy isn’t rocket science…but it’s close!It’s all about finding that sweet spot between keeping costs low and customers happy.Smart packaging choices can make a world of difference – think outside the box (pun intended) to slash those pesky shipping fees.DESIGN A COMPREHENSIVE SHIPPING STRATEGY\\nCrafting a shipping strategy is tricky, but doable!You’ll need to balance costs, speed, and customer expectations like a pro.Start by checking your current shipping process.Look for slowdowns and money-wasters.Then, do the math.Compare carriers, service levels, and packaging choices.Keep an eye on those yearly price bumps – USPS, UPS, and FedEx are raising rates by 5.9% in 2024.5\\nNow, think about your customers.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"mV+eCG1H2f1VxXQyn8wpULIx3XUo/xCrP0cnGZip2Qk=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"cbe51a50-b797-43eb-820c-95413908a2e0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"cbe51a50-b797-43eb-820c-95413908a2e0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.geekextreme.com/shipping-tips-for-small-businesses/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"91d58f33-e799-4ff1-bc15-a441fdee202d\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.geekextreme.com/shipping-tips-for-small-businesses/\"},\"hash\":\"b3OE4KXOF7OYeamjGffD+SOj5T4Fs+Rry35eb0OACtg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"8416c9ed-d419-4957-9941-1375c34901f8\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.geekextreme.com/shipping-tips-for-small-businesses/\"},\"hash\":\"mV+eCG1H2f1VxXQyn8wpULIx3XUo/xCrP0cnGZip2Qk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"954a93f8-275c-4826-99e8-a1bc5bb932bd\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"c+tMfRS7ZLSIBI6nTvPtQdg8ZkU4SZMe8/4qraabbds=\"}},\"text\":\"Happy

about your customers.They hate surprise costs – 75.7% abandon their carts because of hidden shipping fees.Be clear about charges.Maybe offer free shipping with a catch.Set a minimum order value about 30% above your average order.This can boost sales and keep shipping profitable.Keep in mind, 36% of shoppers leave if shipping costs too much.It’s all about balance!2\\nA good shipping strategy is like a well-oiled machine – it keeps your business running smoothly and efficiently.OPTIMIZE PACKAGING FOR COST REDUCTION\\nNow that you’ve got a solid shipping strategy, let’s talk about cutting costs on packaging.Smart packaging can save you big bucks!Did you know that in the U.S., $1 billion worth of goods get damaged during shipping each year?Yikes!But don’t worry, we’ve got some tricks up our sleeve.First off, size matters.Using the right box size can slash your shipping costs.Think about it – why pay for air?UPS and FedEx use a formula (LxWxH / 139) to figure out dimensional weight.USPS uses a slightly different one (LxWxH / 166).So, pick boxes that snugly fit your products.6 Also, try lightweight packing materials.Bubble wrap and airbags are your friends here.They’re light but still keep your stuff safe.And hey, your customers will thank you for not having to dig through a mountain of peanuts to find their order!7\\nUTILIZING TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE EFFICIENCY\\nTech can be a game-changer for your shipping game.Smart software and automation tools can slash your workload and boost accuracy – it’s like having a digital assistant on steroids!AUTOMATE SHIPPING PROCESSES\\nShipping automation is a game-changer for small businesses.It’s like having a robot assistant who never sleeps!With tools like ShipStation, you can zap away tedious tasks.No more manual order entry or label printing – these systems do it all.They sync with your online store, grab order details, and spit out shipping labels faster than you can say “package delivered.”8\\nBut wait, there’s more!IoT devices are joining the party.These smart gadgets track your inventory and shipments in real-time.They’re like tiny spies…but for good!They help you optimize routes and cut down on errors.9 Plus, automated picking and packing machines boost speed and accuracy.It’s like giving your shipping process a turbo boost.ShipStation users even saw a 16% jump in average order value with their Branded Returns Portal.Now that’s what I call a shipping success story!IMPLEMENT SHIPPING SOFTWARE FOR MANAGEMENT\\nShipping software is a game-changer for small biz owners.It’s like having a digital shipping guru at your fingertips!This nifty tech helps you track inventory in real-time, monitor shipments, and even crunch numbers to spot areas where you can save some cash.10 Plus, it’s a breeze to use – no tech wizardry required.Good software is like a good friend – it’s there when you need it and makes your life easier.I’ve used these tools myself, and let me tell you, they’re worth their weight in gold.They slash shipping costs, boost profits, and make customers happier.11 Ship.com, for example, offers sweet deals on shipping rates and free home pickup.That’s a win-win in my book!SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE SHIPPING CARRIER\\nPicking the right shipping carrier can make or break your small biz.It’s not just about cost – speed, reliability, and
