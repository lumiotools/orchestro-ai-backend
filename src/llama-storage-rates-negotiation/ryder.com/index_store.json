To All Content\nOctober 19, 2023\nHow are E-commerce Shipping Costs Calculated?E-Commerce|Blogs\nBy: Beth Owens\nThe rising cost of shipping is a problem for small and large businesses alike - especially as consumer expectations for fast shipping only continue to grow.But to create with a viable solution for high shipping costs, you need to understand what goes into the price on the shipping label.The truth is that a lot of factors go into determining shipping costs - and some of them might surprise you.So, how are shipping costs calculated, and how can brands use this information to their advantage to reduce shipping costs?In this blog, we're going to cover what factors go into calculating shipping costs and share actionable strategies to help keep your shipping costs as reasonable as possible.TL;DR\nAccurate shipping cost calculation helps identify areas for cost reduction and maximizes profit margins.Key factors in calculating shipping costs include dimensional weight, package weight, shipping zones, and shipping speed.It's also important to consider additional costs like peak season surcharges, accessorial charges, and duties/taxes can also impact shipping rates.Why it's important to accurately calculate shipping costs\nIdentify what is pushing up your costs.Shipping rates may be expensive, but there are probably additional factors under your control that are resulting in unnecessary dollars being spent.For example, a lack effective cartonization will result in a higher DIM weight for a package, which means a higher cost to ship.By assessing these characteristics, you can identify where you can reduce shipping costs.Maximizing profit margins.Regardless of whether you are paying for shipping or passing on the cost to your customer, shipping costs have a direct impact on your profitability.If your customer is paying for shipping, you need to know what your average shipping costs are in order to pass on a competitive fee that minimizes cart abandonment, or set up an accurate free shipping threshold.Shipping costs fluctuate throughout the year.Shipping is never a 'set and forget' strategy, because shipping services are constantly being re-evaluated by carriers as operational costs rise.Between peak season surcharges and general rate increases, brands need to be consistently checking in to see if their current shipping strategy is aligned with average shipping costs.What you need to determine shipping costs\nA carrier's shipping calculator is a very handy tool to get an idea of what different shipping options or speeds are going to cost you.However, those estimates are only going to be as good as the data you give it.To get accurate estimates for shipping a package, you need to have the following information to hand:\nDimensional weight\nDIM (dimensional) weight is a method used by carriers to calculate shipping prices based on cubic size, rather than the actual weight of the package.Most shipping companies including USPS, FedEx, and UPS now use dimensional weight for domestic and international shipments, unless the actual package weight is greater.This reflects how space is becoming a premium on delivery vehicles and packages are being billed accordingly.Calculating shipping costs requires measuring package dimensions accurately.To calculate DIM weight, you need to determine the package's cubic size, divide it by the carrier's dimensional weight divisor, and round up to the nearest whole number.Package weight\nAs we stated above, actual package weight comes into play to calculate shipping costs when actual weight of a parcel is higher than dimensional weight.The heavier a parcel is, the more it will cost to ship.Packages that are over a certain weight may have to be shipped using dedicated shipping services.Number of shipping zones\nShipping zones are geographical regions that allow carriers to calculate the distance that packages need to travel from the origin to the shipping destination.This helps carriers to calculate shipping rates and delivery times effectively and more predictability.The more shipping zones that a parcel has to cross to get to its destination, the higher the average shipping costs will be.Businesses can shorten shipping distances by operating multiple fulfillment centers.By allocating orders to the location that is closest to the end customer, packages will cross fewer shipping zones and cost less to ship.Shipping speed\nSpeed always comes at a premium in shipping.Expedited shipping options will cost retailers considerably more, especially when combined with any of the above like a high DIM weight or multi-shipping zone deliveries.The faster you want a package to arrive (and for that rapid delivery date to be guaranteed) the higher that shipping rates will be.For example, a brand's average shipping costs are going to be considerably higher if they are using an overnight service for their orders, as opposed to an economy or standard shipping method that takes 3-5 days to arrive.Additional costs to be aware of\nThe areas outlined above form the foundation of how carriers calculate their base rates for both domestic and international shipping.However, these are not the only charges that brands should be aware of when trying to accurately calculate shipping costs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yzyLFgt6qAC7QRnFRKYpmVr0eIv6LGrVhEnYFdI9lyM="},"c859933e-4c0e-4574-b2d3-f1bcbbaa9d7a":{"id_":"c859933e-4c0e-4574-b2d3-f1bcbbaa9d7a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/calculate-e-commerce-shipping-costs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f5191fab-063b-4cae-bed5-869808b80a22","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/calculate-e-commerce-shipping-costs"},"hash":"EBbjhMtivpQIA2/Tu5Uoz1/T23nl0UKnMLBsb1G0+bs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cdc5fa93-5bef-47e5-bd80-9eb20d507e97","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/calculate-e-commerce-shipping-costs"},"hash":"yzyLFgt6qAC7QRnFRKYpmVr0eIv6LGrVhEnYFdI9lyM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"88bbbd91-53e8-4caf-93c3-e8d625997a92","metadata":{},"hash":"9+ffSI5ccUv0NUUgoVH7NcjbpULlcm9wBlTcuSXGqh4="}},"text":"By

foundation of how carriers calculate their base rates for both domestic and international shipping.However, these are not the only charges that brands should be aware of when trying to accurately calculate shipping costs.In addition to the base shipping rate, shipping carriers will bring in additional fees at certain times of year or charge additional costs on packages that meet certain criteria.It's important to have an in-depth understanding of these fees so your business can estimate shipping costs and set the right budget for their needs:\nParcel handling related charges\nShipping and handling costs refer to the materials and time required to get parcels ready for shipment.This includes packaging materials, labor, storage, specialized equipment, and more.If you partner with a 3PL, these costs will take the form of line items that are charged as part of your overall fulfillment costs.If you are self-fulfilling customer orders these costs may be less visible, but nonetheless form a key aspect of your shipping costs.Demand surcharges\nDemand surcharges, also known as peak season, are additional fees that major shipping carriers impose on top of their regular shipping rates to account for higher operational expenses during peak demand periods like the holiday season.Typically, these surcharges are fixed amounts applied to each package.Demand surcharges should not be confused with a General Rate Increase, which recognizes a longer-term growth in operational costs within the shipping industry.Residential delivery fees\nDelivering parcels to residential addresses is much more costly and inefficient than commercial addresses, as every package requires a tailored delivery route and drop-off.Because of this, shipping carriers may levy a residential delivery surcharge on these packages during busy times of year like the holiday season, or in cases where a business has not selected a residential package service, for example FedEx Home Delivery.Shipping insurance\nFor certain high-value items, it's worth considering adding on shipping insurance to protect against theft or damage in transit.This avoids the merchant having to foot the bill for replacement items or return shipping costs, which quickly eats into your profit margins.Some shipping rates come insure parcels up to a certain value, so it's important to understand when you might need additional insurance.Accessorial charges\nAccessorial charges are applied in scenarios where a parcel cannot be processed using a carrier's regular automated process.This includes oversized packages, extra equipment being required, or any form of manual handling during the sortation process.For example, if a polymailer got stuck in a sortation machine and needed to be removed by a worker, this would be considered as additional handling and would likely incur a charge.Unlike peak season surcharges which are billed upfront when the package is shipped, accessorial charges after the fact.Duties and taxes\nWhen shipping internationally, businesses need to decide how they are going to manage the duties and taxes that may be applied to shipments.There is a choice to be made between Delivery Duty Unpaid (DDU) and Delivered Duty Paid (DDP).DDU places the responsibility for taxes and customs fees on the buyer, with the seller handling only the shipment costs and documentation.In contrast, DDP means the seller covers all duties and taxes, as well as shipping the goods to the customer.DDU offers buyers more control but can result in surprise fees and delays, potentially leading to customer complaints.Tips to reduce shipping costs\nCheck a shipping cost calculator\nShipping calculators allow you to quickly get a shipping cost comparison between different carriers.All major carriers including United States Postal Service, UPS, and FedEx have a shipping calculator available on their website.You can also invest in shipping software that can compare shipping rates in real-time using one interface.For example, Ryder E-commerce uses our in-house SmartRate selection tool to assess a customer's order history and determine the best shipping strategy for their needs.Use flat rate shipping\nBecause flat fee shipping methods calculate rates on package size rather than the weight of the package, it offers a great way for businesses to standardize their shipping costs and save money on longer delivery distances.Flat rate shipping is also commonly exempt from peak season surcharges, as well as including packaging within the shipping rate.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"t7R1UmrVC2PSwNOK7wJoL0PnJP5QjyJ0Ctr5HDYEEs4="},"88bbbd91-53e8-4caf-93c3-e8d625997a92":{"id_":"88bbbd91-53e8-4caf-93c3-e8d625997a92","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/calculate-e-commerce-shipping-costs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f5191fab-063b-4cae-bed5-869808b80a22","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/calculate-e-commerce-shipping-costs"},"hash":"EBbjhMtivpQIA2/Tu5Uoz1/T23nl0UKnMLBsb1G0+bs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c859933e-4c0e-4574-b2d3-f1bcbbaa9d7a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/calculate-e-commerce-shipping-costs"},"hash":"xZovIcQYajqeQDdzTCRWf6n+yxOte54fKqbnDQ3Vqms="}},"text":"DDU

surcharges, as well as including packaging within the shipping rate.Major carriers including USPS, FedEx, and UPS all offer their own versions of flat-rate shipping.But while flat-rate offers predictable costs and is well-suited for free shipping promotions, it may not suit businesses who are doing a lot of short-haul deliveries or those seeking creative branding opportunities.Use a free shipping threshold\nImplementing a free shipping threshold for online orders allows e-commerce businesses to offer free shipping without sacrificing profitability to low-value orders.Calculating the optimal free shipping threshold requires analyzing your average order value and shipping fees to find the right balance between enticing customers and protecting your profit margins.However, setting the right threshold is crucial, as too low or too high thresholds can impact average order values and cart abandonment rates.It's also essential to account for bulky or heavy items in your calculation, and decide whether or not to exempt these from your threshold.Shipping consolidation\nOnline shoppers frequently encounter split shipments in e-commerce, where a single order is divided into multiple deliveries.While this may seem advantageous in getting certain items to the customer faster, it results in much higher shipping fees, not to mention higher shipping related charges like packaging and order fulfillment.Split shipments occur for several reasons, including poor inventory management and cartonization strategies.Instead, allow customers to opt for order consolidation options to save money and be more sustainable.Use multiple shipping speeds\nIt may come as a surprise, but not every customer is going to want rapid shipping - especially if this results in additional costs to their order.According to Shippo’s 2023 State of Shipping Report 75% of consumers who were given the choice between a free and fast shipping offer would choose free shipping.Brand can keep their shipping costs low by offering free shipping options on slower shipping speeds, while offering faster shipping rates at an additional cost.This enables your brand to offer consumers more flexibility via a full spectrum of shipping services, without breaking the bank.You can learn more about e-commerce shipping trends in our 2023 E-commerce Consumer Study.Consider a third-party logistics (3PL) provider\nDetermining shipping costs and implementing changes to your shipping strategy is an ongoing responsibility that takes precious time away from other areas of your business.Partnering with a 3PL for e-commerce fulfillment not only takes this responsibility off your plate, but qualifies you for discounted shipping rates due to partner's high shipping volume.This is one of the most effective ways to reduce overall shipping costs while also getting access to advanced parcel expertise.Related Content\nNovember 18, 2024\nHow to Prevent Overselling During

crucial role in determining the overall cost of shipping packages from A to B.These additional fees, ranging from address correction to redelivery or additional handling, can significantly impact a company's bottom line if efforts are not made to mitigate them.The fact that accessorial fees are not charged until after shipment causes many businesses to trip up on the fine print.Nobody likes surprise charges - especially when shipping is already such a massive running cost.In this blog, we're going to explore accessorial charges, how they are applied, and what businesses can do to prevent these additional fees from piling up.What are accessorial charges?Accessorial charges are additional fees or surcharges levied by parcel carriers on top of regular shipment rates.Accessorial fees are designed to cover scenarios that fall outside of the standard shipping services.This includes any extra services, resources, or time spent carrying out specific shipping requests or activities.Accessorial charges are normally charged on a per-shipment or per-package basis and accumulate as separate line items.Why do shipping carriers apply accessorial charges?The price paid by the shipper to send a package is carefully calculated to take into account a range of factors, including:\nPackage weight\nDelivery route miles\nDestination\nService level\nBut there is another side to this equation: The amount of operational resources and time it takes to process that package from beginning to end.Because the need for additional handling or processing services may not become apparent until after the shipping rate has been paid, accessorial charges applied after the fact ensure that parcel carriers are not on the hook for those extra costs.For example, if a parcel or envelope becomes stuck in a sortation machine and needs to be processed manually, an accessorial fee for additional handling ensures that carriers are compensated for the additional effort required.What is the difference between accessorial charges and demand surcharges?Accessorial charges and demand surcharges are terms that are used interchangeably when talking about additional fees levied on shipments.However, they are targeted at different scenarios.While accessorial charges are targeted at compensating carriers for additional services, additional equipment usage, or time, demand surcharges are applied to cover increased operating costs during periods of high demand for delivery services.This is most common during the holiday season, though it can occur at any time of year when parcel volumes spike (as was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic).Accessorial charges may increase temporarily during the holiday period in response to operational pressure on parcel networks.But demand surcharges are influenced by broader market factors, and so are not directly tied to additional services as accessorial fees are.“The main difference for the shipper that is demand surcharges are volume-based, while accessorial surcharges apply to any package regardless of volume or destination,” says Sean Kim, Vice President of E-Commerce Experience and global Parcel Strategy at Ryder.“Demand surcharges are billed upfront, but an oversize or additional handling surcharge will get billed after the fact, which can come as a nasty surprise to shippers.”There's another key difference that shippers need to take into account: While demand surcharges are almost impossible to avoid during peak season, accessorial charges can be prevented with the right planning and execution.Common types of accessorial charges\nAdditional handling surcharge\nAs parcel sortation has become increasingly automated, most carriers will levy an additional fee when a package requires manual interaction beyond standard procedures.This could be due to a parcel's large size, fragile items, or packaging type.This type of accessorial charge is designed to compensate carriers for the extra labor and resources the additional handling requires, as well as the potential increased risk of injury or damage.Example: A parcel or freight shipment may include special handling instructions for the parcel, such as \"place this side up\" which requires extra attention by delivery personnel.This may trigger an additional handling surcharge, especially if an advance notification is not given to the carrier.Fuel surcharge\nGas is one of the biggest running costs for any transportation provider, so it's common for parcel carriers to pass on some of this cost if gas prices rise beyond levels that a base shipping rate can support.Fuel surcharges are dynamic, and may come into effect with little warning.Typically, they are set based on the current price of fuel, such as the U.S.Department of Energy's Diesel Fuel Index.Example: UPS reviews its fuel surcharge weekly to ensure that it keeps pace with current fuel prices.As of 11/13/2023, there is a 15.25% fuel surcharge on all Ground Domestic shipments.Address correction surcharge\nAddress validation is an important step in the shipping process.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2Mg1rcXuBLwQ2kEE2TU63+ElzeVOjn4J/TO85cWg/6g="},"b4207cbc-0e5f-411c-8274-fd9f20c8e692":{"id_":"b4207cbc-0e5f-411c-8274-fd9f20c8e692","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/e-commerce-accessorial-charges"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6f64a1f6-8afe-439a-b0ce-8a298ced4e85","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/e-commerce-accessorial-charges"},"hash":"T3er6gIAmrwUXyjCRQETXo17xntxW7JPe57U1dBt6MQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ebc103b1-9345-4d51-b00f-1505188950b7","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/e-commerce-accessorial-charges"},"hash":"2Mg1rcXuBLwQ2kEE2TU63+ElzeVOjn4J/TO85cWg/6g="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a96b9202-e06c-487b-b4bd-f2b4535fa14a","metadata":{},"hash":"VFsRZnQuHiKxX/8CxZN7NWpsy3H0AlcInJwo/sgAUts="}},"text":"This

with current fuel prices.As of 11/13/2023, there is a 15.25% fuel surcharge on all Ground Domestic shipments.Address correction surcharge\nAddress validation is an important step in the shipping process.This is where the carrier checks that the address provided is accurate and deliverable.If the address provided does not match an address within the carrier's postal system, they may apply an address correction fee to cover additional labor and time taken to correct the delivery address.Common address mistakes that trigger accessorial fees on a shipment include incorrect postcodes, incomplete delivery addresses, or incorrect formatting which causes manual address validation to be required.Example: An online shopper fails to include their apartment number on the delivery address, meaning that the delivery truck driver doesn't know where the package needs to be left.In this scenario, the parcel carrier will need to contact the customer to ask for additional delivery information, resulting in a surcharge.Scheduled pick up surcharge\nIf a business wants the parcel carrier to pick up their parcels instead of going to the post office, this is an additional service that the carrier may charge for.This is more likely to occur if the pick up is taking place outside of the carrier's standard pick up windows or out of route miles, or if the shipper is not eligible for any volume-based discounts.Example: If an e-commerce business wants a parcel carrier to pick up a group of priority packages from their warehouse on a Saturday, this may qualify for extra accessorial charges, either per package or as a percentage of the total shipping cost.USPS, for example, charges $14.75 for Pickup on Demand on Express Mail, Priority Mail, and Parcel Post services.Delivery area surcharge\nA delivery area surcharge (DAS) applies when a parcel carrier is delivering a package that is either outside of their regular area of operation or is more difficult or time-consuming to access.The surcharge helps to compensate for the additional cost and inefficiencies of delivering to these locations and may be applied according to zip code, delivery type, or infrastructure quality.Example: Carriers often designate certain zip codes with higher delivery costs as being liable for delivery area surcharges.This is most common in rural areas, which are less accessible by major highways or airports.UPS levies extra costs of $2.10 per package that is delivered to a residential destination belonging to a specified list of zip codes.Residential delivery surcharge\nDeliveries to residential addresses are among the least efficient for parcel carriers to execute, since each address may only be the recipient of one package compared with multiple deliveries of hundreds of packages to commercial addresses.Residential delivery surcharges are designed to cover the higher operational costs of serving a residential area, such as apartment buildings and suburbs.This may take the form of an additional fee, or be calculated into the pricing structure of a particular service.Example: Although it specializes in delivering to residential addresses, FedEx Home Delivery still applies a separate residential delivery charge of $5.15 per package in addition to the base shipping rate.Large package surcharge\nPackages that are larger than a certain size or weight dimensions specified by the carrier may be liable for a large package surcharge to cover the additional time and effort of loading or unloading these packages.Different carriers will use different criteria for determining when the surcharge is applied, including the length, width, height, and overall volume of the package.The size of the surcharge is either a flat fee or scaled depending on how much the package exceeds the carrier's size or weight limits.Example: Given that large packages can be considerably more difficult for carrier personnel to load or unload, it's not unusual for large package charges to be some of the largest accessorial fees awarded by carriers.FedEx's oversize surcharge, for example, is determined by the number of zones a package is traveling, with a large package on FedEx Home Delivery costing $160 per package for zone 2.Redelivery surcharge\nIf a package is unable to be delivered successfully to the delivery address given, the parcel carrier may impose a redelivery charge to cover the cost of making another delivery attempt.Failed deliveries can happen for various reasons, such as the recipient not being available, an incorrect address, or limited access to the property.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/XiHs3nYge5fwhvZYIJJzWqBw9QmEptgGSXL7xXKb9Y="},"a96b9202-e06c-487b-b4bd-f2b4535fa14a":{"id_":"a96b9202-e06c-487b-b4bd-f2b4535fa14a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/e-commerce-accessorial-charges"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6f64a1f6-8afe-439a-b0ce-8a298ced4e85","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/e-commerce-accessorial-charges"},"hash":"T3er6gIAmrwUXyjCRQETXo17xntxW7JPe57U1dBt6MQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b4207cbc-0e5f-411c-8274-fd9f20c8e692","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ryder.com/en-us/insights/blogs/e-comm/e-commerce-accessorial-charges"},"hash":"gLv+91Ku91VDJ5SLTYI+yzcxmsLFYIRI0s9Du3fHGOY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4ec24eda-2c3f-4c80-a818-f5b07d1e855c","metadata":{},"hash":"3FwJumig8ViR+tFLUiueArfuRwF2Wgz2HF8cqxv/XnQ="}},"text":"The

charge for all subsequent delivery attempts.Example: If a delivery driver cannot find a secure place to leave a parcel that will keep it safe from theft, delivery regulations may demand that the parcel must be kept and re-delivered on a future delivery run.How to manage accessorial charges for lower shipping costs\nAvoid simple errors that trigger accessorial surcharges\nMany of the most common accessorial charges are caused by mistakes on behalf of the shipper that take time and resources by the carrier to correct.Scenarios such as incorrect addresses, failed deliveries, and additional handling can be avoided entirely with a little extra preparation.For example, implementing address validation into your shipping workflow ensures that you are using the right address before the parcel is in the hands of the carrier, reducing the likelihood of correction fees being applied.Ryder's platform, for example, uses carrier databases to ensure that addresses are spelled and formatted correctly.Likewise, businesses can avoid redelivery charges by ensuring that customers are aware when their order is out for delivery.Sending a delivery notification when parcel drop-off is imminent allows customers to plan to be home to receive their package, reducing incidences of failed delivery.Use the right service for each parcel\nDifferent types of customer orders will be suited to different services, depending on characteristics like dimensional weight or contents i.e. hazardous materials.The shipping service you choose can be the difference between not only optimizing freight costs but also whether any accessorial charges are applied.Using specialist freight carriers for extremely heavy or large packages, for example, reduces large package surcharges because freight shippers are better equipped to manage oversized products compared with other carriers.Using local or regional delivery services can also help to avoid delivery area surcharges, as delivery routes are tailored to specific zip codes.Shipping method mapping is a great way to map orders containing certain criteria i.e. order value, product type, delivery destination, and speed to specific shipping methods you are using.This saves valuable time allocating orders manually and ensures that they are being shipped using the most appropriate service that reduces accessorial fees.Pay close attention to surcharge updates\nCarriers may update their accessorial charge policies with limited warning, especially ahead of the holiday season or in preparation for the new financial year.Raising accessorial fees by $0.10 or $0.20 might not sound like a lot, but multiplied by hundreds of parcels, this increase can seriously undermine your profit margins.Be sure to regularly check the websites of the carriers you use and subscribe to alerts to stay informed and adapt your shipping strategies accordingly.Partner with a 3PL\nIn addition to making shippers eligible for wholesale shipping rates, another upside to partnering with a 3PL is that they can help to identify where accessorial charges are coming from - and come up with strategies to mitigate them.“At Ryder, we quantify exactly how many and which packages had accessorial charges applied, down to the individual tracking numbers,” says Kim.“This allows us to work with customers to understand what shipment characteristics are causing problems and how to remedy them.”By leveraging the experience of a 3PL partner like Ryder, businesses can future-proof their shipping strategy with inside advice on what is causing the majority of accessorial charges, enabling them to sustainably reduce shipping costs - from the ground up.Related Content\nNovember 18, 2024\nHow to Prevent Overselling During Sales\nE-commerce digital
