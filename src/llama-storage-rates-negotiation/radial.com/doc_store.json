What was once viewed as a minor inconvenience has transformed into a critical issue that demands innovative solutions and strategic thinking. \\nThe Growing Problem of Returns \\nAccording to EMARKETER, return rates are decreasing back down to pre-pandemic levels. However, the severity of the returns problem has still escalated at an alarming rate. In 2022, only 2% of retailers considered returns a severe issue for their business. Fast forward just one year to 2023, and that number has skyrocketed to a staggering 49%. This dramatic increase underscores the urgency for retailers to address and optimize their returns processes.   \\nKey Concerns for Retailers \\nAs the returns challenge has grown, two primary areas of concern have emerged for retailers:  the costs of returns and minimizing fraud. \\n1. Cost of Returns Shipping and Handling \\nIn a Radial survey, 60% of retail executives reported that one of the biggest challenges they face in reverse logistics is the cost to repackage/restock. The expenses associated with processing returns can be substantial. These costs include reverse logistics, processing labor, inventory management, and value depreciation. For many retailers, these costs can eat significantly into profit margins, especially in categories with high return rates such as apparel and electronics. \\n2. Minimizing Fraudulent Returns \\nReturn fraud has become increasingly sophisticated and costly. The National Retail Federation estimated that in 2023, 13.7% of returns were fraudulent, up from 10.4% the previous year. This translates to an estimated $101.91 billion in fraudulent returns, a 20% increase from 2022. \\nAccording to the NRF, common types of return fraud include: \\nWardrobing or “renting”: Purchasing items with the intent to use and then return them. \\nReceipt fraud: Using fake or stolen receipts to return items for cash. \\nPrice arbitrage: Buying items on sale and returning them at full price for a profit. \\nSwitch fraud: Returning a similar but less valuable item in place of the original purchase \\nChanging Policies to Address Challenges \\nIn response to these growing concerns, many retailers are revising their return policies. These changes include: \\nCharging for return shipping: 81% of retailers are charging for returns. Many retailers now pass the cost of return shipping onto the customer, either partially or in full. \\nIntroducing restocking fees: Some retailers have implemented restocking fees, typically a percentage of the item’s price or a flat fee, to offset processing costs. \\nShortening return windows: The standard 30-day return period is being reduced by some retailers to encourage quicker decision-making by customers. \\nTightening eligibility criteria: Stricter rules around the condition of returned items are being enforced to reduce abuse of return policies. \\nStrategies to Lower the Cost of Returns \\nTo address the returns challenge without significantly impacting customer satisfaction, retailers can consider implementing a range of strategies: \\nImprove Product Information \\nRadial’s research tells us that 49% of customers who returned items did so because the item didn’t match the description. One of the most effective ways to reduce returns is to help customers make more informed purchasing decisions. Retailers can do this by providing detailed product descriptions, comprehensive sizing guides, high-quality images and videos, and leveraging user-generated content. \\nImplement a Tiered Return Policy \\nA tiered return policy can offer free returns for loyalty program members or on orders above a certain value, incentivizing customer retention and larger purchases. \\nOptimize In-Store Returns \\n64% of customers prefer to return items in-store. For retailers with physical locations, encouraging in-store returns can reduce shipping costs, provide opportunities for immediate exchanges, and drive additional foot traffic. \\nLeverage Data Analytics \\nAnalyzing return data can help identify patterns, improve inventory management, and address recurring issues that lead to returns. \\nPartner with Reverse Logistics Specialists \\nOutsourcing returns management to experts can help retailers streamline the process and reduce overall costs.  \\nImplement AI-Powered Fraud Detection \\nAdvanced technology solutions can help retailers identify and prevent fraudulent returns more accurately, reducing losses without inconveniencing honest customers.  \\nThe Future of Returns Management \\nAs we look ahead, it’s clear that effective returns management will be a key differentiator for successful retail businesses. The retailers who thrive will be those who can strike the delicate balance between cost control and customer satisfaction. \\nSeveral trends are likely to shape the future of returns management, including a focus on sustainability, personalization of return experiences, the use of augmented reality to reduce return rates, and the potential of blockchain technology to combat certain types of return fraud. \\nConclusion \\nThe challenge of retail returns is complex and multifaceted, requiring a nuanced approach that balances financial considerations with customer experience. By implementing thoughtful strategies that leverage technology, data, and innovative policies, retailers can turn the challenge of returns into an opportunity for building loyalty and improving operations. \\nRemember, while it’s important to manage costs, the return process remains a crucial touchpoint in the customer journey. Retailers who can provide a smooth, fair return experience while minimizing their own expenses will be well-positioned for success in 2024 and beyond. \\nRadial: Your Partner in Optimizing Returns Management \\nFor retailers looking to streamline their returns process and reduce associated costs without compromising customer satisfaction, Radial offers comprehensive solutions.

As the backbone of eCommerce fulfillment, order fulfillment encompasses the entire journey, from the moment an order is placed to its safe arrival at the customer’s doorstep. \\nUnderstanding the significance of order fulfillment is vital for eCommerce businesses seeking to excel in a highly competitive landscape. \\nWhat Is Order Fulfillment?\\nOrder fulfillment refers to the process of ensuring customer expectations are met with orders successfully completed and delivered. The online order fulfillment process typically includes the following stages:\\nOrder Processing\\nWarehousing & Inventory Storage Management\\nOrder Picking and Packing\\nCreating Labels & Shipping Orders\\nOrder Tracking \\nReturns and Exchanges\\nEffective order fulfillment is critical for meeting customer exceptions, improving satisfaction, and promoting loyalty. It requires efficient coordination between various departments, accurate inventory management, streamlined processes, and effective customer communication. Automation and technology solutions are often employed to optimize the order fulfillment process and ensure smooth and timely delivery.\\nImportance of Order Fulfillment\\nEffective order fulfillment drives customer satisfaction, increases retention rates, enhances brand reputation, and improves operational efficiency — all of which give eCommerce stores a competitive edge.\\nCustomer Satisfaction: Delivering customer orders accurately and on time enhances their satisfaction. When customers receive their orders promptly and in excellent condition, it reinforces a positive perception of the business. Satisfied customers are more likely to become repeat customers and advocates, leading to increased loyalty and positive word-of-mouth referrals.\\n\\nIncreased Customer Retention: Effective eCommerce fulfillment contributes to higher customer retention rates. When customers consistently have positive experiences with order fulfillment, they are more likely to return for future purchases. Repeat customers have a higher lifetime value and can become valuable brand advocates, positively impacting business growth.\\n\\nEnhanced Brand Reputation: Efficient and reliable order fulfillment builds a strong brand reputation. Small businesses that deliver orders promptly and accurately gain trust and credibility in the marketplace. A positive brand reputation can attract new customers and differentiate the business from competitors.\\n\\nOperational Efficiency: Effective order fulfillment processes improve overall operational efficiency. Streamlined workflows, optimized inventory management, and automated systems reduce errors, minimize delays, and maximize productivity. This leads to cost savings, improved resource allocation, and increased operational capacity.\\n3 Tips to Improve Order Fulfillment \\nOrder fulfillment operations encompass several best practices that can optimize processes and ensure exceptional customer experiences. \\nTimely Shipping and Delivery: Establishing partnerships with shipping carriers, providing shipping options like expedited, same day, or three to five day economy delivery, and communicating tracking information builds brand trust and ensures a positive shopping experience.\\n\\nTransparent Order Tracking: Allowing customers to track orders, providing order status updates, and offering a self-service customer portal to access order history, tracking information, and initiative returns offer transparency that eliminates uncertainties, reduces anxiety, and fosters trust.\\n\\nHassle-Free Returns and Exchanges: Businesses can show their commitment to customer satisfaction by offering a seamless and convenient process for returns and exchanges, such as providing clear instructions and pre-paid return labels.\\n\\nHow to Choose the Right Order Fulfillment Provider\\nChoosing the right order fulfillment provider is crucial for ensuring smooth operations and exceptional customer service. Here are factors to consider when choosing an order fulfillment provider (third-party logistics – 3PL ) provider:\\nEvaluate Fulfillment Capabilities: Look for providers with capabilities that match your needs and order fulfillment strategy. Assess their warehouse facilities, technology infrastructure, order processing systems, inventory management tools, and shipping capabilities. Consider their capacity to handle peak seasons or fluctuations in order volume.\\n\\nScalability and Flexibility: Evaluate the provider’s ability to scale operations as your business grows. Consider their flexibility in accommodating changes in order volume, seasonal demands, or expanding product lines. A provider with flexible pricing models can be advantageous.\\n\\nTechnology Integration: Ensure that the provider’s order management system (OMS) or fulfillment software can integrate seamlessly with your eCommerce platform, inventory management system, and other relevant systems. Smooth integration enables real-time data exchange, reduces errors, and enhances efficiency.\\n\\nShipping and Delivery Options: Evaluate the provider’s shipping capabilities and carrier partnerships. Look for a range of shipping options to accommodate your customers’ preferences, including expedited or international shipping if necessary.\\n\\nCustomer Service and Returns Handling: Customer service is critical in order fulfillment. Ensure the provider has responsive and helpful support to address any inquiries or issues. Additionally, check their policies and processes for returns handling, ensuring they align with your customer satisfaction goals.\\n\\nCost and Pricing Structure: Compare pricing models and understand the cost structure of the provider’s services. Consider any additional fees, such as storage or return handling charges, and ensure they align with your budget and profitability goals.\\n\\nReputation and References: Research the provider’s reputation in the industry and seek references from their existing clients. Look for testimonials or case studies that showcase their ability to deliver high-quality fulfillment services.\\nWhy Outsource Order Fulfillment?\\nBusinesses have four order fulfillment models when fulfilling orders: in-house fulfillment, dropshipping, cross-docking, hybrid, and working with an order fulfillment company. \\nOutsourcing fulfillment offers cost savings, expertise, scalability, advanced technology, global reach, and the ability to focus on core business functions. It allows businesses to optimize their operations, improve the customer experience, and position themselves for growth and success in the competitive eCommerce landscape.\\nCost Savings: Third-party fulfillment providers often have established infrastructure and resources, allowing them to leverage economies of scale and reduce shipping costs. By outsourcing order fulfillment, businesses can avoid the costs associated with building and maintaining their own fulfillment centers, including warehouse space, equipment, technology, and labor. This can result in significant cost savings.\\n\\nExpertise and Experience: Third-party fulfillment providers specialize in order fulfillment processes. They have the expertise, experience, and knowledge to efficiently handle order processing, inventory management, pick and pack services, and shipping logistics. This expertise ensures accuracy, efficiency, and timely delivery, ultimately enhancing the customer experience.\\n\\nScalability and Flexibility: Third-party fulfillment providers offer scalability and flexibility as your business grows or experiences seasonal fluctuations. They have the capacity to handle increased order volumes and can quickly adapt to changes in demand. This allows businesses to focus on their core competencies and growth strategies without worrying about fulfillment logistics.\\n\\nAdvanced Technology and Systems: Third-party fulfillment providers often invest in advanced technology and systems to streamline operations. They utilize warehouse management systems, inventory tracking software, and automation tools to optimize order fulfillment processes. These technologies improve accuracy, speed, and visibility throughout the fulfillment process.\\n\\nGlobal Reach: If your business operates internationally or plans to expand globally, third-party fulfillment providers with a global network can offer efficient order fulfillment and international shipping capabilities. They have the infrastructure and expertise to navigate customs regulations, manage cross-border logistics, and provide localized customer support\\neCommerce Order Fulfillment \\nOrder fulfillment is critical to eCommerce success, directly influencing customer satisfaction and business performance.

And eCommerce to film is a classic example, right? If you think about a warehouse. You know, all day long is picking and packing and picking and packing. Uh, but the part that makes that task hard to automate is that you could be picking and packing 10 million or 20 million different objects, right?

Simon: “Running a warehouse today is very hard because of the labor problem, right? The, it's, it's very hard to find, to recruit, to train and to retain hundreds or thousands of people.

You know, by the number of nodes in, in your network by three nodes, four nodes, five nodes, you know, whatever it might be. And so that, you know, you're quickly managing thousands of people. It takes a lot of money and, and effort and overhead to manage all of that.

Making sure that customers' expectations are met every time they come to your store is much harder than it sounds. Mark talks about the overall value of visibility not only for customer experience but for more efficient processes on the business side.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT MARK</strong></p><p>Mark Delaney is currently VP Industry Strategy at FourKites. In this role, he engages with retailers’ C-level leaders and their teams to understand and address industry-specific workflows and use cases. He serves as an SME to help drive the product roadmap and support our global sales teams. He keeps a strong pulse on industry trends and frequently solicits customer and partner’s feedback on the technology investments that they are making to help inform and advance FourKite’s innovation with a customer-first mindset. He represents FourKites at industry events and briefings. Prior to FourKites, Mark was a Retail Industry Principal at Zebra Technologies where he led customer briefings, met with the press and analysts and worked with their Ventures organization evaluating potential investments.</p><p><br /> </p><p>Mark has more than 20 years of experience in the retail industry and has worked with most large retailers globally. Before joining Zebra, Mark held leadership roles at Nielsen and General Mills and owned his own retail technology and analytics consulting firm.</p><p> </p><p>Mark holds a BS in Marketing from SUNY Oswego and serves on several boards in his community.

Now because that loyalty's been shattered, there's a very good chance they're going to go across the street to your competitor.\\\"<br /> </p><p>21:56 The importance of listening to consumers and customers - Mark: \\\"One other area that's top of mind with our customers these days is employee satisfaction. Because it's very expensive to lose a good employee, especially someone who's been there for a period of time and you've invested in all that training. For them to be mired down by spreadsheets and phone calls and all that, if you can give them that visibility and confidence that they're communicating something that's accurate, they feel better as associates.\\\"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Find out more about Mark in the links below:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjdelaney001/\\\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjdelaney001/</a></li><li>Website: <a href=\\\"https://www.fourkites.com/\\\">https://www.fourkites.com/</a></li></ul> <p><p><strong>Subscribe and Keep Learning!</strong></p><p>If you’re a logistics leader looking to scale sustainably, don’t miss out!

Now because that loyalty's been shattered, there's a very good chance they're going to go across the street to your competitor.\\\" 21:56 The importance of listening to consumers and customers - Mark: \\\"One other area that's top of mind with our customers these days is employee satisfaction. Because it's very expensive to lose a good employee, especially someone who's been there for a period of time and you've invested in all that training. For them to be mired down by spreadsheets and phone calls and all that, if you can give them that visibility and confidence that they're communicating something that's accurate, they feel better as associates.\\\" Find out more about Mark in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjdelaney001/ Website: https://www.fourkites.com/</itunes:summary>\\n<itunes:subtitle>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Mark Delaney, Vice President of Global Industry Strategy at FourKites.

HIGHLIGHTS 02:31 How Sandra led as the first-ever Chief Supply Chain Officer of Kimberly-Clark 09:33 Must-have attributes when building a team for supply chain 13:29 The top priorities leading Mondelēz at the start of the pandemic 23:26 On moving to digital 27:54 Comparing regional innovation and sustainability 36:51 What we can expect with automation in the CPG QUOTES 04:28 Sandra's advice for future supply chain leadership: \\\"Don't lose sight of what supply chain is, is what I would say at the start. There are key principles that we have in supply chain around who we are and what we are. They apply anywhere. So if anybody tells you, you have to rethink everything, that's not true. There's core, basic fundamentals, service quality, safety, and all these kinds of things. 29:13 We should connect together where we can - Sandra: \\\"If they've not had recognition, they feel the need to be seen, so it has to be theirs. And as opposed to when we get to, hopefully at some point when business and the corporate world gets to the place where we're gonna share with each other for the better of everything. It sounds a bit naive, but I do believe that's what we should be doing corporately.\\\" Find out more about Sandra in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandramacquillan/</itunes:subtitle>\\n<itunes:keywords>dan coll, ecom logistics podcast, e-commerce retail, procurement, logistics, supply chain, fulfillment iq, ninaad acharya, sustainability, sandra macquillan</itunes:keywords>\\n<itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit>\\n<itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>\\n<itunes:episode>23</itunes:episode>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<guid isPermaLink=\\\"false\\\">8f940526-b08f-4691-a829-b951adce35e9</guid>\\n<title>How To Transition to Sustainable Fleet Operations Using Data and Logistics with Essa Al-Saleh</title>\\n<description>\\n<![CDATA[ <p>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Essa Al-Saleh, CEO and Board Member of Volta Trucks.

Being the true last mile partner where orders are delivered the same day they pick it up has been the goal of Alok's company. They wanted to be hyperlocal and empower local SMBs to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world. </p><p>Alok digs into why different last-mile solutions exist to address the needs of different types of buyers. He also explains that, given their low barrier for entry, that local shops can be given a low risk alternative to see how they can offer a comparable solution to Amazon and grow their business.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT ALOK</strong></p><p>Alok has over 15 years in software, technology and e-commerce. Along with his co-founders, Alok has created a platform, in Trexity, that makes it possible for any small business to deliver quickly and locally. Alok is a serial entrepreneur who encourages and supports like-minded individuals to succeed in their business.</p><p>Alok began imagining a platform that could make it possible for any small business to deliver local and fast, and one that is fair and takes advantage of neither merchants nor couriers. He believes that filling this need will help disrupt our over-reliance on faraway e-commerce giants and help small businesses stay in business. </p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>01:20 Alok's early exposure to business and his passion for technology</li><li>06:01 Perfecting last-mile, hyperlocal delivery for SMBs</li><li>12:38 The future of last-mile delivery: Owned Infrastructure vs. the Gig Economy  </li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p>07:50 Perfecting hyperlocal delivery opened up national markets for Trexity - Alok: \\\"We started out empowering your favorite store on your favorite street of your favorite neighborhood. The local mom and pop. And on of the things that was really important to us when we started out, we said, let's be the true last mile partner. The same day we pick it up, it's the same day we're going to drop it off, as fast as our merchants are willing to fulfill it, it's as fast as we will deliver it. And let this be the one thing that we do so perfectly well that no one else can touch us on it.\\\" </p><p>13:25 Owned-infrastructure and gig economy have their own pros and cons - Alok: \\\"It's not one or the other. Both of those FedEx models exist for a reason because there's an addressable market for both of them. And I don't think it has to be warehousing or direct from merchant. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

Being the true last mile partner where orders are delivered the same day they pick it up has been the goal of Alok's company. They wanted to be hyperlocal and empower local SMBs to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world. Alok digs into why different last-mile solutions exist to address the needs of different types of buyers. He also explains that, given their low barrier for entry, that local shops can be given a low risk alternative to see how they can offer a comparable solution to Amazon and grow their business. ABOUT ALOK Alok has over 15 years in software, technology and e-commerce. Along with his co-founders, Alok has created a platform, in Trexity, that makes it possible for any small business to deliver quickly and locally. Alok is a serial entrepreneur who encourages and supports like-minded individuals to succeed in their business. Alok began imagining a platform that could make it possible for any small business to deliver local and fast, and one that is fair and takes advantage of neither merchants nor couriers. He believes that filling this need will help disrupt our over-reliance on faraway e-commerce giants and help small businesses stay in business. HIGHLIGHTS 01:20 Alok's early exposure to business and his passion for technology 06:01 Perfecting last-mile, hyperlocal delivery for SMBs 12:38 The future of last-mile delivery: Owned Infrastructure vs. the Gig Economy QUOTES 07:50 Perfecting hyperlocal delivery opened up national markets for Trexity - Alok: \\\"We started out empowering your favorite store on your favorite street of your favorite neighborhood. The local mom and pop. And on of the things that was really important to us when we started out, we said, let's be the true last mile partner. The same day we pick it up, it's the same day we're going to drop it off, as fast as our merchants are willing to fulfill it, it's as fast as we will deliver it. And let this be the one thing that we do so perfectly well that no one else can touch us on it.\\\" 13:25 Owned-infrastructure and gig economy have their own pros and cons - Alok: \\\"It's not one or the other. Both of those FedEx models exist for a reason because there's an addressable market for both of them. And I don't think it has to be warehousing or direct from merchant. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

He has lived and worked in China, India, Africa, Saudi Arabia, Europe, and the United States. Brittain is a global strategy and supply chain consultant and a writer for Forbes and his own website, brittainladd.com.

I think what TikTok needs to do is, again, change how commerce is done on the platform. So I think what would be very interesting is if TikTok acquires Shopify, so where now I have Shopify, I have a Shopify storefront on TikTok, and so then what happens is I immediately see a video come across but it's a video from a storefront, and without having to go to a website, I see it, I buy it.

Edward shares the trends in supply chain he is observing today post-COVID and beyond. </p><p>From the way Amazon changed logistics forever and its effects in consumer expectations as a result, to the importance of remaining agile and how to do it, Edward takes a deep dive into how global supply chains will look like in the near future and how to maintain inventory to scale.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT EDWARD</strong></p><p>Edward Hertzman received a degree in economics from NYU and spent more than a decade working as a top executive for major sourcing companies all over the world, including Synergies Worldwide and Pearl Global. Hertzman sits on the Board for Delivering Good, a charitable organization that channels the resources of the fashion industry to those in need.</p><p>In 2009, in response to a need in the industry, he founded Sourcing Journal Online. With more than 75,000 subscribers, Sourcing Journal Online is the largest trade journal devoted to the sourcing apparel and textile industry supply chain in the world. </p><p>In August 2020, he was promoted to executive vice president of Fairchild Media, tasked with growing the businesses of all Fairchild Media titles in his new position, while continuing to lead the day-to-day operations at Sourcing Journal. He will also oversee the growth of Fairchild Media’s strategic content studio, bolstering the creation of engaging, interactive content to help industry partners stand out in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>07:07 DTC is dying and mergers are set to happen</li><li>13:08 Surviving devaluation and managing inventory for what's to come</li><li>20:23 Keeping sourcing lean and agile in fashion</li><li>25:23 Nearshoring and diversifying manufacturing and sourcing capabilities</li><li>30:22 Regulations and sharing the responsibility of sustainability in supply chain management</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p><strong>14:27 On pushing back on the growth-at-all-costs mindset, Edward says, </strong>\\\"Just don't acquire customers saying, <i>Oh, the lifetime value is X </i>and never really realize that. Don't buy inventory without testing the product. Find retail partners that are gonna support you, not just be transactional.\\\"</p><p><strong>31:09 As regulations will push for tangible sustainability measures from retail, Edward says, </strong>\\\"I think there's only two ways to incentivize people or two ways to get people to change. One is through incentive and one is through repercussions. And what I mean by that is either you're gonna pay me more to do something or you're gonna punish me for not doing it.\\\"</p><p><strong>39:48 To survive the recession, Edward suggests, </strong>\\\"I think that if people don't think short term, the same way I say don't buy a million T-shirts when you really only need five. Don't just start laying off to make the quarter. It's very hard to find talent in this space. Don't stop investing in technology to make the quarter because you're gonna need that technology.\\\"</p><p> </p><p>Find out more about <strong>Edward </strong>and <strong>Sourcing Journal </strong>in the links below:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-hertzman-2401b38/\\\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-hertzman-2401b38/</a></li><li>Twitter: <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/EdwardHertzman\\\">https://twitter.com/EdwardHertzman</a></li><li>Instagram: <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/edwardhertzman/\\\">https://www.instagram.com/edwardhertzman/</a></li><li>Website: <a href=\\\"https://sourcingjournal.com/\\\">https://sourcingjournal.com/</a></li></ul> <p><p><strong>Subscribe and Keep Learning!</strong></p><p>If you’re a logistics leader looking to scale sustainably, don’t miss out!

And when fulfillment providers cannot keep up with brand growth, it can significantly affect customer experience, NPS scores, returns, and refund rates, to name a few. This is why merchants need to focus on building relationships instead of just working with their service providers. As Ninaad, Dan and Andrew discuss, building confidence on both sides includes having accurate invoicing and forecasting, thorough node strategy planning, and even in-person visits. </p><p>Why is this important?

for Success in 2024 \\nBlog Post • July 31, 2024\\nFor eCommerce retailers, few challenges have grown as rapidly or become as pressing as the management of product returns.What was once viewed as a minor inconvenience has transformed into a critical issue that demands innovative solutions and strategic thinking.The Growing Problem of Returns \\nAccording to EMARKETER, return rates are decreasing back down to pre-pandemic levels.However, the severity of the returns problem has still escalated at an alarming rate.In 2022, only 2% of retailers considered returns a severe issue for their business.Fast forward just one year to 2023, and that number has skyrocketed to a staggering 49%.This dramatic increase underscores the urgency for retailers to address and optimize their returns processes.Key Concerns for Retailers \\nAs the returns challenge has grown, two primary areas of concern have emerged for retailers:  the costs of returns and minimizing fraud.1.Cost of Returns Shipping and Handling \\nIn a Radial survey, 60% of retail executives reported that one of the biggest challenges they face in reverse logistics is the cost to repackage/restock.The expenses associated with processing returns can be substantial.These costs include reverse logistics, processing labor, inventory management, and value depreciation.For many retailers, these costs can eat significantly into profit margins, especially in categories with high return rates such as apparel and electronics.2.Minimizing Fraudulent Returns \\nReturn fraud has become increasingly sophisticated and costly.The National Retail Federation estimated that in 2023, 13.7% of returns were fraudulent, up from 10.4% the previous year.This translates to an estimated $101.91 billion in fraudulent returns, a 20% increase from 2022.According to the NRF, common types of return fraud include: \\nWardrobing or “renting”: Purchasing items with the intent to use and then return them.Receipt fraud: Using fake or stolen receipts to return items for cash.Price arbitrage: Buying items on sale and returning them at full price for a profit.Switch fraud: Returning a similar but less valuable item in place of the original purchase \\nChanging Policies to Address Challenges \\nIn response to these growing concerns, many retailers are revising their return policies.These changes include: \\nCharging for return shipping: 81% of retailers are charging for returns.Many retailers now pass the cost of return shipping onto the customer, either partially or in full.Introducing restocking fees: Some retailers have implemented restocking fees, typically a percentage of the item’s price or a flat fee, to offset processing costs.Shortening return windows: The standard 30-day return period is being reduced by some retailers to encourage quicker decision-making by customers.Tightening eligibility criteria: Stricter rules around the condition of returned items are being enforced to reduce abuse of return policies.Strategies to Lower the Cost of Returns \\nTo address the returns challenge without significantly impacting customer satisfaction, retailers can consider implementing a range of strategies: \\nImprove Product Information \\nRadial’s research tells us that 49% of customers who returned items did so because the item didn’t match the description.One of the most effective ways to reduce returns is to help customers make more informed purchasing decisions.Retailers can do this by providing detailed product descriptions, comprehensive sizing guides, high-quality images and videos, and leveraging user-generated content.Implement a Tiered Return Policy \\nA tiered return policy can offer free returns for loyalty program members or on orders above a certain value, incentivizing customer retention and larger purchases.Optimize In-Store Returns \\n64% of customers prefer to return items in-store.For retailers with physical locations, encouraging in-store returns can reduce shipping costs, provide opportunities for immediate exchanges, and drive additional foot traffic.Leverage Data Analytics \\nAnalyzing return data can help identify patterns, improve inventory management, and address recurring issues that lead to returns.Partner with Reverse Logistics Specialists \\nOutsourcing returns management to experts can help retailers streamline the process and reduce overall costs.Implement AI-Powered Fraud Detection \\nAdvanced technology solutions can help retailers identify and prevent fraudulent returns more accurately, reducing losses without inconveniencing honest customers.The Future of Returns Management \\nAs we look ahead, it’s clear that effective returns management will be a key differentiator for successful retail businesses.The retailers who thrive will be those who can strike the delicate balance between cost control and customer satisfaction.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"b4ZZBrGuJ7Zi9A1T+vRB1tXkWo8WTle8OvCG+aB4Rlo=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"861ff772-cbc2-4954-b0b4-76cebbb6bf82":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"861ff772-cbc2-4954-b0b4-76cebbb6bf82\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.radial.com/insights/retail-returns-strategies-for-success-in-2024\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"b9c72570-0b06-4133-96a1-b8f5c29a5d3f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.radial.com/insights/retail-returns-strategies-for-success-in-2024\"},\"hash\":\"1C0f2dAOGQz9suZ3dRBxqwSWIX/J+ygCSiJgO4SW70c=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"974a7cde-5345-4f3b-8146-8361484353db\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.radial.com/insights/retail-returns-strategies-for-success-in-2024\"},\"hash\":\"b4ZZBrGuJ7Zi9A1T+vRB1tXkWo8WTle8OvCG+aB4Rlo=\"}},\"text\":\"Optimize

the use of augmented reality to reduce return rates, and the potential of blockchain technology to combat certain types of return fraud.Conclusion \\nThe challenge of retail returns is complex and multifaceted, requiring a nuanced approach that balances financial considerations with customer experience.By implementing thoughtful strategies that leverage technology, data, and innovative policies, retailers can turn the challenge of returns into an opportunity for building loyalty and improving operations.Remember, while it’s important to manage costs, the return process remains a crucial touchpoint in the customer journey.Retailers who can provide a smooth, fair return experience while minimizing their own expenses will be well-positioned for success in 2024 and beyond.Radial:

eCommerce Businesses\\nBlog Post • July 04, 2023\\nBehind every click-to-doorstep transaction lies a complex and crucial process that ensures products are delivered accurately and promptly to customers.As the backbone of eCommerce fulfillment, order fulfillment encompasses the entire journey, from the moment an order is placed to its safe arrival at the customer’s doorstep.Understanding the significance of order fulfillment is vital for eCommerce businesses seeking to excel in a highly competitive landscape.What Is Order Fulfillment?Order fulfillment refers to the process of ensuring customer expectations are met with orders successfully completed and delivered.The online order fulfillment process typically includes the following stages:\\nOrder Processing\\nWarehousing & Inventory Storage Management\\nOrder Picking and Packing\\nCreating Labels & Shipping Orders\\nOrder Tracking \\nReturns and Exchanges\\nEffective order fulfillment is critical for meeting customer exceptions, improving satisfaction, and promoting loyalty.It requires efficient coordination between various departments, accurate inventory management, streamlined processes, and effective customer communication.Automation and technology solutions are often employed to optimize the order fulfillment process and ensure smooth and timely delivery.Importance of Order Fulfillment\\nEffective order fulfillment drives customer satisfaction, increases retention rates, enhances brand reputation, and improves operational efficiency — all of which give eCommerce stores a competitive edge.Customer Satisfaction: Delivering customer orders accurately and on time enhances their satisfaction.When customers receive their orders promptly and in excellent condition, it reinforces a positive perception of the business.Satisfied customers are more likely to become repeat customers and advocates, leading to increased loyalty and positive word-of-mouth referrals.Increased Customer Retention: Effective eCommerce fulfillment contributes to higher customer retention rates.When customers consistently have positive experiences with order fulfillment, they are more likely to return for future purchases.Repeat customers have a higher lifetime value and can become valuable brand advocates, positively impacting business growth.Enhanced Brand Reputation: Efficient and reliable order fulfillment builds a strong brand reputation.Small businesses that deliver orders promptly and accurately gain trust and credibility in the marketplace.A positive brand reputation can attract new customers and differentiate the business from competitors.Operational Efficiency: Effective order fulfillment processes improve overall operational efficiency.Streamlined workflows, optimized inventory management, and automated systems reduce errors, minimize delays, and maximize productivity.This leads to cost savings, improved resource allocation, and increased operational capacity.3 Tips to Improve Order Fulfillment \\nOrder fulfillment operations encompass several best practices that can optimize processes and ensure exceptional customer experiences.Timely Shipping and Delivery: Establishing partnerships with shipping carriers, providing shipping options like expedited, same day, or three to five day economy delivery, and communicating tracking information builds brand trust and ensures a positive shopping experience.Transparent Order Tracking: Allowing customers to track orders, providing order status updates, and offering a self-service customer portal to access order history, tracking information, and initiative returns offer transparency that eliminates uncertainties, reduces anxiety, and fosters trust.Hassle-Free Returns and Exchanges: Businesses can show their commitment to customer satisfaction by offering a seamless and convenient process for returns and exchanges, such as providing clear instructions and pre-paid return labels.How to Choose the Right Order Fulfillment Provider\\nChoosing the right order fulfillment provider is crucial for ensuring smooth operations and exceptional customer service.Here are factors to consider when choosing an order fulfillment provider (third-party logistics – 3PL ) provider:\\nEvaluate Fulfillment Capabilities: Look for providers with capabilities that match your needs and order fulfillment strategy.Assess their warehouse facilities, technology infrastructure, order processing systems, inventory management tools, and shipping capabilities.Consider their capacity to handle peak seasons or fluctuations in order volume.Scalability and Flexibility: Evaluate the provider’s ability to scale operations as your business grows.Consider their flexibility in accommodating changes in order volume, seasonal demands, or expanding product lines.A provider with flexible pricing models can be advantageous.Technology Integration: Ensure that the provider’s order management system (OMS) or fulfillment software can integrate seamlessly with your eCommerce platform, inventory management system, and other relevant systems.Smooth integration enables real-time data exchange, reduces errors, and enhances efficiency.Shipping and Delivery Options: Evaluate the provider’s shipping capabilities and carrier partnerships.Look for a range of shipping options to accommodate your customers’ preferences, including expedited or international shipping if necessary.Customer Service and Returns Handling: Customer service is critical in order fulfillment.Ensure the provider has responsive and helpful support to address any inquiries or issues.Additionally, check their policies and processes for returns handling, ensuring they align with your customer satisfaction goals.Cost and Pricing Structure: Compare pricing models and understand the cost structure of the provider’s services.Consider any additional fees, such as storage or return handling charges, and ensure they align with your budget and profitability goals.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"MJh7zcmfs+rAAtZwa1YqUzPOcljDDGTWJnd0YvgETzg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f33feaa8-ed5d-4b42-a60d-98ad58938e9a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f33feaa8-ed5d-4b42-a60d-98ad58938e9a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.radial.com/order-fulfillment\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"f13f8683-93e5-4ebb-a083-32553e4181a6\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.radial.com/order-fulfillment\"},\"hash\":\"o3mAHyUymxNp09ku43T2Fw/t5wNxqaeMjhZy2osl6Sc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"0d864202-f753-4a96-a3bb-d9598a4497e2\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.radial.com/order-fulfillment\"},\"hash\":\"MJh7zcmfs+rAAtZwa1YqUzPOcljDDGTWJnd0YvgETzg=\"}},\"text\":\"A

goals.Reputation and References: Research the provider’s reputation in the industry and seek references from their existing clients.Look for testimonials or case studies that showcase their ability to deliver high-quality fulfillment services.Why Outsource Order Fulfillment?Businesses have four order fulfillment models when fulfilling orders: in-house fulfillment, dropshipping, cross-docking, hybrid, and working with an order fulfillment company.Outsourcing fulfillment offers cost savings, expertise, scalability, advanced technology, global reach, and the ability to focus on core business functions.It allows businesses to optimize their operations, improve the customer experience, and position themselves for growth and success in the competitive eCommerce landscape.Cost Savings: Third-party fulfillment providers often have established infrastructure and resources, allowing them to leverage economies of scale and reduce shipping costs.By outsourcing order fulfillment, businesses can avoid the costs associated with building and maintaining their own fulfillment centers, including warehouse space, equipment, technology, and labor.This can result in significant cost savings.Expertise and Experience: Third-party fulfillment providers specialize in order fulfillment processes.They have the expertise, experience, and knowledge to efficiently handle order processing, inventory management, pick and pack services, and shipping logistics.This expertise ensures accuracy, efficiency, and timely delivery, ultimately enhancing the customer experience.Scalability and Flexibility: Third-party fulfillment providers offer scalability and flexibility as your business grows or experiences seasonal fluctuations.They have the capacity to handle increased order volumes and can quickly adapt to changes in demand.This allows businesses to focus on their core competencies and growth strategies without worrying about fulfillment logistics.Advanced Technology and Systems: Third-party fulfillment providers often invest in advanced technology and systems to streamline operations.They utilize warehouse management systems, inventory tracking software, and automation tools to optimize order fulfillment processes.These technologies improve accuracy, speed, and visibility throughout the fulfillment process.Global Reach: If your business operates internationally or plans to expand globally, third-party fulfillment providers with a global network can offer efficient order fulfillment and international shipping capabilities.They have the infrastructure and expertise to navigate customs regulations, manage cross-border logistics, and provide localized customer support\\neCommerce Order Fulfillment \\nOrder fulfillment is critical to

this episode, <strong>Simon Kalouche</strong>, founder and CEO of Nimble, joins the hosts to discuss the future of ecommerce logistics and the role of automation and robotics.Simon emphasizes the importance of automating core warehouse processes while acknowledging the challenges of handling edge cases.He shares his background in robotics and the application of deep learning in the field.Simon also highlights the potential of gecko adhesive technology for gripping and handling objects in logistics.The conversation explores the need for warehouses designed for robots and the vision of creating fully autonomous warehouses.Simon concludes by emphasizing the value of human involvement in the evolving landscape of ecommerce logistics.</p><p><br /> </p><p><strong>ABOUT SIMON</strong></p><p>Simon founded Nimble in 2017 after dropping out of his PhD at Stanford.He's spent the last 5 years inventing and scaling intelligent next-gen autonomous logistics systems.Previously Simon led development of dynamic legged robots for the Department of Defense while completing his masters in robotics at Carnegie Mellon, International Space Station robots for NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab and autonomous off-road vehicles for the Air Force Research Lab.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong><br /><br />If you try to automate all the one-offs, your warehouse will end up costing way too much.</p><p>There's always edge cases and one-off things you have to solve for in logistics.</p><p>Deep Imitation Learning allows robots to learn tasks through human demonstration.</p><p>Designing warehouses conducive to robots opens up new possibilities for automation.</p><p>The future of ecommerce logistics lies in a balance between automation and human involvement.</p><p><br /> </p><p>QUOTES</p><p><br /> </p><p>Real-World Automation Strategist, Variability Management Specialist.Simon: “I saw an opportunity to deploy this in the real world.There are so many monotonous, repetitive tasks out in the real world that are, you know, that are very repetitive, but yet too hard to automate because there's a lot of variability involved.And eCommerce to film is a classic example, right?If you think about a warehouse.You know, all day long is picking and packing and picking and packing.Uh, but the part that makes that task hard to automate is that you could be picking and packing 10 million or 20 million different objects, right?And every object has a different size and shape and weight and texture and stiffness and something you're fragile.”</p><p><br />Labor Optimization, Warehouse Automation.Simon: “Running a warehouse today is very hard because of the labor problem, right?The, it's, it's very hard to find, to recruit, to

operational rigor to execute but recognize difficulties - Joe: \\\"I said before, fulfillment's hard.It is just an underrated, really difficult task to pull off because you are dealing with very large

hard.It is just an underrated, really difficult task to pull off because you are dealing with very large costs, very variable business and nobody knows how to forecast.I don't care who tells you great

episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Kevin Lawton, Founder of The New Warehouse.Today, he talks about the innovations that are starting to take over warehousing operations today.</p><p>Kevin shares how he started his podcast and how the warehousing space has changed over time with the emergence of technology.From AI and computer vision being utilized in training to more practical applications on the job.He also discusses how he got into the micro-fulfillment space and what he expects moving forward.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT KEVIN</strong></p><p>Kevin has been involved in the distribution industry for 11 years, primarily focusing on inventory control.He started The New Warehouse Podcast in 2019 with over 350 episodes published.He is also an adjunct professor in supply chain at Rider University.</p><p>He has grown The New Warehouse into a 3PL services business with a recently opened Micro-fulfillment center in Philadelphia.</p><p>

</p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p><strong>21:10 Using virtual reality for warehouse training - Kevin:</strong> \\\"I love the training stuff just with the safety aspect overall.Training in the warehouse should be the same every time.I think programs like that allow you to do that same type of training every time.</p><p><strong>24:07 Any tools that help understand what's happening in the warehouse are extremely impactful - Kevin:</strong> \\\"When you think about reducing staff by bringing in automation and robotics and just having member shortages in general with less people wanting to work in warehouses.Think about 4-5 managers having to cover half a million square feet, you can't be everywhere at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>Find out more about Kevin in the links

pandemic 14:51 The bullwhip effect in retail supply chain recently 21:05 Can we expect more automation and robotics in warehousing?27:07 Don't try to match what Amazon is doing 34:24 Will there be conflict in CPG when working with consumers and being a direct-to-consumer brand?QUOTES 16:58 Don't diversify only when there are issues - Sucharita: \\\"One of the things we learned from the pandemic was that maybe we are too concentrated with our supply chains in Asia, particularly in China, then you add on some of the geopolitical issues.I think companies are gradually recognizing that maybe they do need to diversify their supply chains.But it's a painful decision to have to make because then you have to increase the costs of your inputs.\\\"27:07 Look inward instead of trying to compete with top players like Amazon - Sucharita: \\\"I think that the companies that created a lot of the frenzy around shipping were the ones that fundamentally didn't really have differentiated offerings.They were selling the same things Amazon is selling and net-net all being equal, if you are slower than Amazon, you have the same products, and you're not even pricing better, you really don't have a choice but to either lower your prices or increase your speed of shipping.\\\"Find out more about Sucharita in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sucharitamulpuru/

Elyassi-Rad</title>\\n<description>\\n<![CDATA[ <p>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Patrick Nikoletich and Nima Elyassi-Rad, the CTO and the Vice President of Global Business Development of Shippo respectively.We sit with the amazing duo to talk about understanding fulfillment from different perspectives, creating a great delivery experience, and the innovations shaping the space for businesses and consumers alike.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT PATRICK AND NIMA</strong></p><p>Patrick is a technology executive and founder.He currently serves as the Chief Technology Officer at Shippo managing both product and engineering organizations.Previously, he served as the VP of Product at Truveta focused on developing AI/ML applications to improve the outcomes of patients receiving treatments, at Microsoft in Azure and AI & Research divisions as an engineering and program manager, and working for and leading small businesses developing applications with larger enterprises.In his spare time he enjoys skiing, riding motorcyles and hiking in the Pacific Northwest with his wife and two dogs.</p><p>Nima, on the other hand, is a technology executive, investor, and founder.He currently serves as the VP of Business Development at Shippo.Previously, he started a soccer brand, spent time as a VC, knows how to sling pizza, and put in time on the 1st and 2s as a Hip Hop radio DJ.</p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>02:25 Logistics from a cost and customer experience perspective</li><li>09:25 You don't need to have an Amazon-like delivery experience especially early on.</li><li>15:14 Many copycat brands will start going away.</li><li>21:13 Innovations and their practical applications in the eCom space today.</li></ul><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p>03:53 Any warehouse shipper has to consider someone to be their infrastructure - Nima: \\\"Tech forward folks don't like it, you come for the integration and you stay for the switching cost because it's too expensive to rip something out.But in reality, things are breaking down.So when you are picking a new partner, I think it's important to really vet them to understand are they enterprise-ready and what that readiness means for your organization.\\\"</p><p>23:12 AI and ML applications have been \\\"invading\\\" everyone's lives for many years - Patrick: \\\"The thing that you have to recognize is that 85-90% of ideas around AI and ML applications will probably fail, they won't return any meaningful value and won't be used as something stand-alone that can drive growth and revenue for your business but really the power is in how they augment

from being part of the Marine Corps to now leading businesses in the supply chain side.</p><p>Prashant talks about what he learned in the military that has transitioned through the supply chain and logistics side of his career today.He also shares insights on driving growth while also making sure to reduce costs at the same time.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT PRASHANT</strong></p><p>Prashant Shah, who joined SwagUp in 2021 runs Supply Chain as the Chief Supply Chain Officer, based in Piscataway, New Jersey.Prashant joins SwagUp with 17 years of senior level management experience in Supply Chain.He was born and raised in India, and came to the USA in 2001.He started his studies in engineering but quickly found his way into the United States Marine Corps office a day after 9/11 to serve his country against terrorism.He served 8 years in the Marines and was medically discharged due to injuries in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p>After his medical discharge from the Marines in 2009, he returned to New Jersey and started working in Target as an unloader in the overnight shift while trying to finish his Bachelor's in Criminal Justice.In 2010, after graduating, he became a Sales-floor Executive at Target which led to his promotion to Sr.Logistic Executive in Jersey City, New Jersey Target location.Following from Target, he soon landed a role at the largest Macy’s Distribution Center and moved up the rank of Director of the Distribution Center in a unionized environment and successfully led 200+ members to the best-engaged building in the country.This was when Prashant tasted the success of being a leader in the distribution and logistics role and found his real passion in the supply chain world.</p><p>From this moment, the sky was the limit and he worked in Bed Bath and Beyond, Drive Medical and Lasership as Head of Supply Chain.In his current role in SwagUp, his vision while it aligns with CEO and Founder of SwagUp, Michael Martocci, is to become a $1Billon company within 5 years.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"qt0tZCMZnL9RyZShJy2abRBbTMLYYX1PzoKz3UmodeA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4d0c4aa9-ec19-43b3-aae9-715f9fde964b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4d0c4aa9-ec19-43b3-aae9-715f9fde964b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/8VMlhZbS\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"182debb3-30a5-41c3-9bc3-476ba861853d\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/8VMlhZbS\"},\"hash\":\"Ou2PMRlSW3rWzt3Fb6NqVKmn/9AgeqfcxztDerHPCqo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"6769ba1d-b5f7-428d-906d-c132d0f457db\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/8VMlhZbS\"},\"hash\":\"CAiycyvquqBGROOduRG6p7iInhpHaLZWwmLnSYwldRI=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"89f4e2fd-05e9-49a2-ad13-a8a2a1c74d2b\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"nAFiNiysRCqRnZVJceVGUpO+oaqdXfA/B0aVKI6CTS0=\"}},\"text\":\"In

different cultures, backgrounds, ethnicities, and so for.That really preps them for the camaraderie piece because you're literally having your life put in somebody's hands and you have each other's back.\\\"</p><p>Going from zero to ninety-nine is tremendous, especially with personnel - Prashant: \\\"If we want to get to 99-100%, then I will need additional individuals.But who is going to volunteer to go to Afghanistan and stay with me for 6 months?So getting to the preparation, we need to be 100% so that way we don't need additional personnel so they can be used somewhere else.The mindset is we don't have anybody, that's all you have.Whatever you see, that's it.\\\"</p><p> </p><p>Find out more about <strong>Prashant</strong> in the links below:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a

and ecommerce and led operations and strategic partnerships at Google Shopping and Shippo before building Tusk.Having seen the small parcel industry from many angles — as an operator, software

saws.And if you run into that one, it's a buzz saw.You're not gonna make it here if you just don't believe that.So looking for people that are core-value-focused, are people-focused, they understand that what we do is done through the hard work of people, who have a get-stuff-done bias or just GSD, it was get it done, and are client-centric.So it was kind of four big buckets of things that I'm looking for that transcends or enables technical competency.\\\"Find out more about Dusty in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustyholcomb/ Website:

Ciemcioch</title>\\n<description>\\n<![CDATA[ <p>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Steven Ciemcioch, President of Warehouse Anywhere.He discusses how they created a preferred partner network of other mid-sized to large independent storage operators.</p><p>This network allowed them to source storage for their customers from 12,000 different locations.In order to make this process more efficient, they also developed RFID technology to help manage the process and provide real-time updates on inventory.</p><p>Steven, along with Dan and Ninaad, also discusses the Amazon Effect, how consumer expectations have changed due to this, what brands and logistics companies must do to keep up, and the various factors that influence if and when they should match this speed of fulfillment.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT STEVEN</strong></p><p>Steven Ciemcioch was named President of Warehouse Anywhere, a Life Storage Company, in 2018 and previously served as Corporate Alliance Manager in which he developed and headed the corporate sales division at Life Storage.</p><p>He has extensive experience in building and scaling businesses in a high-growth environment.He has

fulfillment</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p>30:54 The Amazon Effect is most apparent in general merchandise - Ninaad: \\\"If you're a general merchandise and that stuff exists on walmart.com, amazon.com, and you have these sites and marketplaces that are giving you the next-day, 2-day delivery experiences, consumers will pay couple of extra dollars and get it with that

Trexity.Being the true last mile partner where orders are delivered the same day they pick it up has been the goal of Alok's company.They wanted to be hyperlocal and empower local SMBs to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world.Alok digs into why different last-mile solutions exist to address the needs of different types of buyers.He also explains that, given their low barrier for entry, that local shops can be given a low risk alternative to see how they can offer a comparable solution to Amazon and grow their business.ABOUT ALOK Alok has over 15 years in software, technology and e-commerce.Along with his co-founders, Alok has created a platform, in Trexity, that makes it possible for any small business to deliver quickly and locally.Alok is a serial entrepreneur who encourages and supports like-minded individuals to succeed in their business.Alok began imagining a platform that could make it possible for any small business to deliver local and fast, and one that is fair and takes advantage of neither merchants nor couriers.He believes that filling this need will help disrupt our over-reliance on faraway e-commerce giants and help small businesses stay in business.HIGHLIGHTS 01:20 Alok's early exposure to business and his passion for technology 06:01 Perfecting last-mile, hyperlocal delivery for SMBs 12:38 The future of last-mile delivery: Owned

Brittain Ladd, Strategy Advisor Shatranj Capital Partners.Brittain's no-holds-barred insights on management and logistics have not only captured people's attention, but they have also even proven to be accurate given how many of his predictions have come true.He discusses some of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, Twitter, and TikTok, and gives hot takes on what they are doing wrong and how they can make it right.He comments on the recent layoffs at Amazon and how he believes it is only the beginning and a symptom of a much larger shift that will affect entire industries worldwide.Brittain then digs into how partnerships can change e-commerce by providing social commerce platforms the established fulfillment infrastructure they need to deliver goods to the consumer.He also discusses in great detail the flaws of the quick commerce model and how fulfillment should be a question of accurate delivery versus quick delivery.ABOUT BRITTAIN Brittain has 20 years of experience in supply chain management and logistics.He has lived and worked in China, India, Africa, Saudi Arabia, Europe, and the United States.Brittain is a global strategy and supply chain consultant and a writer for Forbes and his own website, brittainladd.com.Brittain is also recognized as being one of the most accurate analysts in business.He successfully predicted multiple major acquisitions more than a year in advance of them occurring, including Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods, Microsoft and Walmart partnering to bid on TikTok, and most recently, Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.Brittain is frequently quoted in the press and often appears on major news networks like CNN, Fox Business, and the BBC.HIGHLIGHTS - 01:37 i get a lot - Posting thought-provoking ideas and predictions on social media - 08:52 what type of - Amazon's mistake and getting down to its optimal fighting weight - 18:47 let's talk about - Twitter can change e-commerce with shoppable videos - 25:43 I've had people - Instead of creating their own fulfillment, TiktTok should partner with Amazon/Walmart/Target/Shopify - 35:42 i'd love to - Quick commerce is a failure: Fast delivery vs accurate delivery QUOTES 23:51 Shoppable videos can save Twitter - Brittain: \\\"I believe the way that Elon Musk saves Twitter and makes Twitter completely different is through shippable videos and, I think, absolutely, that what Elon Mush should be doing is we need short-form videos, shoppable videos, and for every shoppable video we put on Twitter, we take 12% of all sales, and I think the goal should be for every shoppable video that Elon Musk puts on Twitter, that it generates 100 to 250 million in sales.\\\"25:50 TikTok should acquire Shopify for its fulfillment infrastructure - Brittain: \\\"I think, number one, TikTok needs to do something above and beyond than just opening up their own fulfillment centers.I think what TikTok needs to do is, again, change how commerce is done on the platform.So I think what would be very interesting is if TikTok acquires Shopify, so where now I have Shopify, I have a Shopify storefront on TikTok, and so then what happens is I immediately see a video come across but it's a video from a storefront, and without having to go to a website, I see it, I buy it.And that's how I refer to what I think is the

transactional.\\\"</p><p><strong>31:09 As regulations will push for tangible sustainability measures from retail, Edward says, </strong>\\\"I think there's only two ways to incentivize people or two ways to get people to change.One is through incentive and one is through repercussions.And what I mean by that is either you're gonna pay me more to do something or you're gonna punish me for not doing it.\\\"</p><p><strong>39:48 To survive the recession, Edward suggests, </strong>\\\"I think that if people don't think short term, the same way I say don't buy a million T-shirts when you really only need five.Don't just start laying off to make the quarter.It's very hard to find talent in this space.Don't stop investing in technology to make the quarter because you're gonna need that

this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome James Malley, the \\\"Cartonization Magnate\\\" and Founder and CEO of Paccurate.Reducing the amount of air in packages is not just good for profits, it’s critical for the environment too.James discusses the complex but critical question of how to reduce air in packages with cartonization.He digs into the low-hanging fruit that companies can initiate to begin cartonization, as well as raises awareness of the gravity of the waste issue worldwide.HIGHLIGHTS 02:58 Cartonization: Packing mistakes and the factors that drive them 14:59 Amazon packing practices are practical but waste is a major issue 18:59 Cartonizing realizes hidden savings per square foot 28:47 Lead the shift because the waste problem needs to be resolved QUOTES 19:36 Bad cartonization is still better than no cartonization - James: \\\"The good news is there's a ton of low-hanging fruit, so if you don't have any cartonization, use bad cartonization.It'll get you at least some of the way there to get you started and help you keep your margins intact.\\\"27:04 The data proves that the waste problem is much more significant - James: \\\"My team is very motivated by this idea that we could put a dent in some of the waste in supply chain.And I think it's kind of a rude awakening, a little bit, when you start digging into the data of how bad things
