the 2024 edition of the Pharma Manufacturing World Summit held earlier this month in Boston, we spoke with Michael Andrews, the Global Product Manager | SmartFactory Rx® of Applied Materials, to talk about an important issue facing pharmaceutical manufacturers and how the experience of the semiconductor industry can help: Alarm Management.In most manufacturing facilities, an alert, an alarm, a warning, or a notice is going off somewhere every few seconds.Different machines inform different operators of different data.Very few manufacturers have a clear overview of what is being flagged everywhere at any one time, and the human operators who work with their systems day in and day out quickly learn to ignore some alarms while perhaps putting too much time and attention into monitoring others.Would it not be to everyone’s advantage to have an overarching system that brings all alarms up to the same level of visibility and then helps human operators recognize which ones to focus on at any one time?As luck would have it, the ever-evolving semiconductor manufacturing space has already created a system that operates in an even more fast-paced and exacting manufacturing environment than the one most pharmaceutical companies operate in, and Applied Materials is helping taking the hard-won lessons of Alarm Management from that industry and bringing it to the tightly regulated, patient-focused, quality-centric pharmaceutical manufacturing space.For every pharmaceutical executive who worries things are getting missed in their manufacturing facilities, give this episode a listen!--\n\nApplied Materials provides pharma manufacturers an opportunity to leverage decades of experience in increasing productivity in semiconductor manufacturing.SmartFactory Rx™ is a suite of

08:00:00 -0400 ◦ 23 MINUTES\nAt the 2024 edition of the North American Manufacturing Excellence Summit series we sat down with Willem Sundblad to talk about how manufacturers are using AI to give shopfloor employees capabilities and knowledge once only available to experiences and senior staff.Right now, one of the biggest challenges manufacturing organizations face is having the skilled labor they need to not only do the work, but improve performance, troubleshoot issues, and optimize productivity.Older workers are retiring.We are also living in a time of high turnover.New employees coming into a company do not have the same opportunities for on-the-job training and job shadowing that their predecessors enjoyed, and few companies are able to invest that kind of time and attention into developing future top performers as they did in days gone by, especially in a changing business landscape where that emerging top talent may decide to move on sooner than was true in the past.For all the wonderful things AI promises to do for businesses, perhaps the most important contribution will be improving training and putting institutional knowledge, instruction, advice, and instructions in the hands of everyone in an interactive and highly useful and actionable way.It is the right solution arriving at the right time to make a serious impact on a growing challenge.Give this episode a

in the post-pandemic business landscape of frequent disruption, and how 4PLs are contributing to that ongoing conversation.While third-party logistics companies have always and will always be an important component of supply chains at local, regional, national, and international levels, 4PLs —organizations that take on many of the planning, oversight, and coordination powers of a supply chain organization, including directing and monitoring the actions of 3PLs— are uniquely positioned to modernize and reorganize long-established plans and networks to better meet the needs of today’s businesses.In this conversation we get into what that kind of partnership looks like, how it makes an impact, and what senior supply chain leaders need to be thinking about and learning about as they

NBA.Toni hosted a themed lunch discussion on the importance of Equity as the foundation upon which all DEI programming should be built upon, and in this interview she shares some of the most important takeaways from that conversation.The acronym of DEI sometimes lumps things together in a way that clouds issues and makes it difficult to prioritize work that HR practitioners can and should do to move their cultures forward.Toni makes a powerful case that Diversity and Inclusion cannot be achieved if Equity has not already been addressed and included on an ongoing basis, but what does that look like in real terms?Give this episode a listen!--\nToni Lowe\n Chief Diversity Equity Inclusion Officer at Huge\nToni Howard Lowe is a global diversity equity & inclusion and human resource

Conley about the advantages of connecting Supply Chain teams and Finance teams through Integrated Business Planning (IBP), which is a well-established business system that is now offering a wide range of important new capabilities in the current business landscape of frequent disruption we are all trying to navigate today.Resiliency and Risk Management are always reinforced through visibility, transparency, and easy collaboration between different departments and leaders, and IBP lives and breathes on those principles.That said, there are challenges involved in getting IBP up and running effectively.Companies need to think about their culture, how they collect and analyze data, and how the day-to-day work of their people will change when everyone is sharing and looking at the same information at the same time.What is the best path forward for companies who want to implement IBP and then get the most out of it?Give this episode a listen!--\nMichael Conley is a seasoned Supply

generation of experienced auditors are beginning to age out, and there seems to be a gap behind them where younger FSQ professionals have not opted into auditing as a focus for their careers.Liz points out that there is no auditor school or direct path to become an auditor.The industry educates its own people to have this skillset over the course of their careers, and a very real bottleneck is approaching where there will be more work to be done than there are qualified people to do it.What should FSQ professionals be doing to advance auditing as a specialization among their ranks?How

apologize for the inconvenience.At North American Food Safety & Quality 2023 we sat down with Louis-Olivier Roy of OPTEL Group to talk about one of the most important challenges and opportunities facing FSQ professional today: Being able to see their products from one end of the value chain to the other.New regulations are coming online that demand Food Safety and Quality teams be able to document everything that happens to the food under their responsibility, but beyond compliance, knowing the quality and quantity of goods at all stages of the journey from farm to fork offer a wide range of advantages and capabilities that generate real ROI.In an evolving regulatory environment where getting data from suppliers is going beyond a best practice to become a requirement, what does treating compliance as the starting point rather than the finish line look like?How can FSQ data collected at this granular level help other parts of the business achieve their goals as well?For all this and more, give this episode a listen!--\nOPTEL has a proven track record of over 30 years in providing end-to-end and highly granular traceability solutions that enable companies to unlock the

edition of the North American Sustainability & Responsibility Summit series we sat down with Nick Balster, the SVP of Operations for Dalkia Energy Solutions, EDF Group, to talk about reducing the carbon impact of companies’ global footprint, especially as it related to existing infrastructure.Any conversation about improving Sustainability has to acknowledge most of the underpinnings of today’s economy we put in place before environmental performance was viewed as anything more than a nice-to-have.There are enormous opportunities to reduce impacts by taking an informed approach to looking around the facilities and other infrastructure your organization uses and identifying opportunities to eliminate waste.Many of these opportunities are inexpensive, and the savings they would
