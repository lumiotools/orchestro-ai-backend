Storage, logistics, and shipping are a huge burden on business operations, and since outsourcing to ShipBob, I've hardly had to deal with any of that at all! I'd contribute most of my 5x growth over the past year to outsourcing to ShipBob.\\n\\nLogistics is never without headaches, and I've certainly experienced some, but ShipBob always corrects course and makes up for it.

If we ran our own warehouse, it would be much harder to hire people and we’d inevitably outgrow the space.\\n\\nHaving a helpful, dedicated account manager at ShipBob that we can go to who responds quickly and has a good understanding of our products and company is really important to us.

AVOID!\\nAVOID this company! The software is poorly designed, the customer support is unhelpful, and we were billed thousands more than we expected. Shipbob has proven unreliable for our mission-critical fulfillment needs.\\n\\nI'll share just TWO of several negative experiences:\\n\\nWe requested a quote to move some inventory from Shipbob last year before the holidays. Their process for getting a quote involved creating a shipping order and writing \\\"DO NOT SHIP\\\" for each line in the address. Despite following this process, they shipped the order anyway. It took about two months for our inventory to be returned, which caused us to miss the busiest shopping season of the year. This resulted in a significant loss of revenue, and Shipbob offered no compensation for their mistake.\\n\\nRecently, I noticed daily charges of $75 on my credit card from Shipbob, going back for months. Upon inquiry, I was told they received a box with three books on August 9th and had been charging us $25 per book per day for storage since no Warehouse Receiving Order had been created. This resulted in over $5,000 in charges, but we didn't ship this package to them. They only sent one email about it, and without any follow-up, continued charging us.\\n\\nShipbob: your service has been extremely unreliable. I've been overbilled, but no one has acknowledged the mistakes. I have to repeatedly ask for help with the same issues, which causes further delays in our fulfillment process. These problems have cost us orders, created unhappy customers, and hurt our business relationships with partners. I find myself spending too much time addressing these issues instead of growing my business.\\n\\nWe regret our decision to use Shipbob, as their service has not met our expectations. If these problems can't be resolved soon, we believe we should be compensated for the costs of moving our inventory elsewhere. Moving to Shipbob from our previous provider was meant to save us money, but it has been a difficult experience.\\n\\nI've spoken with Shipbob leadership several times, but there has been no significant improvement.\\n\\nEDITED: Shipbob has flagged this review repeatedly, trying to get me to take it down. If Trustpilot has any integrity, they will remove my review.\\n\\nI received the following message from Trustpilot: \\\"If your review isn’t updated within 3 days, then we’ll unfortunately have to take it offline.\\\"\\nDate of experience: 25 October 2019\\nUseful\\n2\\nShare\\nNK\\nNicholas K\\n2 reviews\\nUS\\n24 Oct 2019\\nVerified\\n2nd month in a row overcharging for storage.\\nThis is the second month in a row they have overcharged us for storage fees (even after being assured they resolved the problem). To put it in context, the number of pallets they charged us for this month exceeds the total number of pallets we've sent them in the years of doing business with Shipbob. If you choose to work with Shipbob, religiously audit your monthly invoices.\\n\\nAdditionally, we've had issues with their available box sizes which inflates the volumetric pricing model. We are debating whether we should create and provide custom mailers or switch to another fulfillment partner. This was not an issue with our previous provider.\\nDate of experience: 23 October 2019\\nUseful\\n2\\nShare\\nLU\\nLuke\\n1 review\\nUS\\n17 Oct 2019\\nAwesome Partner!\\nShipBob has been a parter of our for almost a year now, and they have been nothing but supportive and helpful when it comes to educating us on their product and offerings. We work very closely with their team on a lot of marketing and client collaborations, and the experience is great every time. Really excited to see what lies ahead for them!\\nDate of experience: 16 October 2019\\nUseful\\n1\\nShare\\nRO\\nRobert\\n2 reviews\\nUS\\n16 Oct 2019\\nVerified\\nHorrible Experience. Avoid\\nHorrible Experience\\nWe have had a terrible experience working with ShipBob and would encourage other companies to avoid using them at all costs even if it means paying more for storage/fulfillment.\\n\\nWe have had errors/issues with ~20%+ of our shipments they have fulfilled. For context, we have a pretty straightforward fulfillment needs as we sell wholesale and so only need case picks. Despite this, the list of problems is never-ending, and includes but is not limited to, sending a single unit instead of a case, sending another company's inventory to our customers, not sending shipments out on time, sending shipments under the wrong shipping option (ex. Ground instead of expedited), overbilling for storage, unnecessarily repackaging or case-packed product, poor communication between customer service reps, and so on.\\n\\nIt is clear that there huge holes in their operations and procedures, and that despite months of problems, issues continue to occur. We have had to spend hours on the phone to get issues corrected and have almost lost customers due to the neverending shipping issues they have caused.\\n\\nIt is not worth the hassle and headache that your business will incur.\\nDate of experience: 15 October 2019\\nUseful\\n2\\nShare\\nJE\\nJesse\\n1 review\\nUS\\n15 Oct 2019\\nShipBob our Chosen Fulfillment Partner\\nShipBob became our fulfillment partner about 6 months ago. They have been the biggest reason why our fulfillment times and costs have decreased.\\n\\nThere was a learning curve for both (us) and ShipBob at the beginning, but once expectations were established I think we have become great partners.\\n\\nTheir software allows any employee, with access, the ability to give live updates on inventory levels and locations. This is a major plus for any business using multiple warehouses.\\nDate of experience: 14 October 2019\\nUseful\\n1\\nShare\\nReply from ShipBob\\n15 Oct 2019\\nHi Jesse, thanks for your comments here and glad we have been able to drive your fulfillment times and costs down.

reviews\\nJP\\nUpdated 21 Oct 2024\\nIncompetent team, dishonest billing, worse than worthless.AVOID!AVOID this company!The software is poorly designed, the customer support is unhelpful, and we were billed thousands more than we expected.Shipbob has proven unreliable for our mission-critical fulfillment needs.I'll share just TWO of several negative experiences:\\n\\nWe requested a quote to move some inventory from Shipbob last year before the holidays.Their process for getting a quote involved creating a shipping order and writing \\\"DO NOT SHIP\\\" for each line in the address.Despite following this process, they shipped the order anyway.It took about two months for our inventory to be returned, which caused us to miss the busiest shopping season of the year.This resulted in a significant loss of revenue, and Shipbob offered no compensation for their mistake.Recently, I noticed daily charges of $75 on my credit card from Shipbob, going back for months.Upon inquiry, I was told they received a box with three books on August 9th and had been charging us $25 per book per day for storage since no Warehouse Receiving Order had been created.This resulted in over $5,000 in charges, but we didn't ship this package to them.They only sent one email about it, and without any follow-up, continued charging us.Shipbob: your service has been extremely unreliable.I've been overbilled, but no one has acknowledged the mistakes.I have to repeatedly ask for help with the same issues, which causes further delays in our fulfillment process.These problems have cost us orders, created unhappy customers, and hurt our business relationships with partners.I find myself spending too much time addressing these issues instead of growing my business.We regret our decision to use Shipbob, as their service has not met our expectations.If these problems can't be resolved soon, we believe we should be compensated for the costs of moving our inventory elsewhere.Moving to Shipbob from our previous provider was meant to save us money, but it has been a difficult experience.I've spoken with Shipbob leadership several times, but there has been no significant improvement.EDITED: Shipbob has flagged this review repeatedly, trying to get me to take it down.If Trustpilot has any integrity, they will remove my review.I received the following message from Trustpilot: \\\"If your review isn’t updated within 3 days, then we’ll unfortunately have to take it offline.\\\"Date of experience: 25 October 2019\\nUseful\\n2\\nShare\\nNK\\nNicholas K\\n2 reviews\\nUS\\n24 Oct

in context, the number of pallets they charged us for this month exceeds the total number of pallets we've sent them in the years of doing business with Shipbob.If you choose to work with Shipbob, religiously audit your monthly invoices.Additionally, we've had issues with their available box sizes which inflates the volumetric pricing model.We are debating whether we should create and provide custom mailers or switch to another fulfillment partner.This was not an issue with our previous provider.Date of experience: 23 October 2019\\nUseful\\n2\\nShare\\nLU\\nLuke\\n1 review\\nUS\\n17 Oct

encourage other companies to avoid using them at all costs even if it means paying more for storage/fulfillment.We have had errors/issues with ~20%+ of our shipments they have fulfilled.For context, we have a pretty straightforward fulfillment needs as we sell wholesale and so only need case picks.Despite this, the list of problems is never-ending, and includes but is not limited to, sending a single unit instead of a case, sending another company's inventory to our customers, not sending shipments out on time, sending shipments under the wrong shipping option (ex.Ground instead of expedited), overbilling for storage, unnecessarily repackaging or case-packed product, poor communication between customer service reps, and so on.It is clear that there huge holes in their operations and procedures, and that despite months of problems, issues continue to occur.We have had to spend hours on the phone to get issues corrected and have almost lost customers due to the neverending shipping issues they have caused.It is not worth the hassle and headache that your business will incur.Date of experience: 15 October 2019\\nUseful\\n2\\nShare\\nJE\\nJesse\\n1 review\\nUS\\n15 Oct

a learning curve for both (us) and ShipBob at the beginning, but once expectations were established I think we have become great partners.Their software allows any employee, with access, the ability to give live updates on inventory levels and locations.This is a major plus for any business using multiple warehouses.Date of experience: 14 October 2019\\nUseful\\n1\\nShare\\nReply from
