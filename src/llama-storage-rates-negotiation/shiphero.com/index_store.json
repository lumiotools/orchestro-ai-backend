Weight and Zone\nFactor 2 | Delivery Speed \nFactor 3 | Warehouse Teams and the Packing Process\nFactor 4 | Special Handling Fees \nFactor 5 | Surcharges \nHow to Reduce Shipping Charges\n3PL Profitability\nKey Takeaways\nAre your outbound shipping costs eating your 3PL’s profits?Today, we will cover five critical factors affecting your shipping costs and provide actionable tips to help you reduce them.We’ll give insights on everything from delivery speed to special handling fees to ensure you make operational decisions that save time and money.Factor 1 | Weight and Zone\nFor products shipped domestically within the US, two key factors come into play: the destination zone and the package’s weight.Zone\nCarriers have established nine zones across the US, with the origin address as Zone 1.Your shipping fees increase as your package moves further from its origin.Here are the current zones with their mileage differences from the source.Zone 1: 1-50 miles\nZone 2: 51-150 miles\nZone 3: 151-300 miles\nZone 4: 301-600 miles\nZone 5: 601-1000 miles\nZone 6: 1001-1400 miles\nZone 7: 1401-1800 miles\nZone 8: 1801 miles or greater\nZone 9: US territories & APO or FPO addresses\nWeight \nWhen it comes to shipping packages, weight matters, it’s a simple concept: the heavier the package, the more you’ll have to pay to get it where it needs to go.But it’s not just about weight; the package’s dimensions also play a significant role.It’s a tricky balance – you want your package to be the right size to hold your products but not so large that it triggers DIM weight surcharges.Investing in a packaging design strategy is worth the time to determine the optimal package size and weight to avoid unnecessary expenses.It’s a small step that can significantly impact your bottom line.Shipping Calculators by Carrier:\nUSPS: Shipping Calculator\nCanada Post: Shipping Calculator\nFedEx: Shipping Calculator\nUPS: Shipping Calculator\nInternational\nIf you’re not taking advantage of duty relief programs for international shipping, you’re leaving money on the table.The numbers don’t lie – Section 321 alone can save you up to 20% on duty fees, and that’s a significant amount.So, what exactly is Section 321 all about?Section 321 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act has revolutionized the eCommerce shipping costs for shippers from Canada or Mexico sending goods into the U.S.to individual customers.With tax and duty exemptions, faster clearance, and reduced paperwork, shippers have remarkable advantages at their fingertips.Section 321’s duty-free entry for goods valued at $800 USD per person per day is a smart way for businesses to grow, as it offers savings for brands looking to get their items to American consumers.While certain products are restricted, these regulations should not deter businesses from enjoying the benefits Section 321 can bring.Factor 2 | Delivery Speed \nThe persistent and aggressive growth in eCommerce demands a seamless process to satisfy customers’ needs, and delivery speed is an essential aspect of any business that hopes to keep up with customer demands in today’s marketplace.Margin integrity is crucial if you want to stay profitable.At ShipHero, we understand that maintaining a delicate balance between cost and delivery speed is essential for our margins to remain healthy.It hasn’t been an easy process, and we’ve made our fair share of mistakes.Nevertheless, we’ve learned that customers expect two-day delivery from Amazon but are generally willing to wait three to four days for other businesses.However, specific expectations, such as real-time tracking, still need to be met.90% of customers want immediate updates and real-time order visibility.Adopting technological solutions can improve delivery experiences and lower consumer inquiries.32% of global shoppers will abandon their carts if an estimated shipping time is too long.Rising standards are forcing 3PLs and carriers to reevaluate traditional distribution models.Fulfillment Trends\nGet ahead of the trend by utilizing micro-fulfillment centers (MCFs) to cut delivery times.MCFs are strategically placed in urban areas and stocked with popular products, making it easy for customers to pick up their online orders.This gives shippers the flexibility to meet rising consumer expectations promptly.Although setting up these local centers can be challenging and pricey, it pays off in the long run by reducing shipping costs and providing an efficient and cost-effective service.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ySLLdrAo5gmkmsq+fMCCaZCWEeDPYcZzuOMzcIcesRQ="},"d046e0d4-c27b-4bc7-ab46-ac2aa84a92b9":{"id_":"d046e0d4-c27b-4bc7-ab46-ac2aa84a92b9","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/5-factors-affecting-your-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e629c712-3695-4574-a008-73f6b4326aaa","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/5-factors-affecting-your-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"W0nQ2Jiju3IiWINPmD9sMnBw8S6l6MSCHnoQS3zZqX8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"42901b98-6a56-4426-8e19-d06ea2e14715","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/5-factors-affecting-your-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"ySLLdrAo5gmkmsq+fMCCaZCWEeDPYcZzuOMzcIcesRQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e26ec568-5278-40b2-be33-9fb098ece11e","metadata":{},"hash":"+IMVE6dia3ky4srYpbKy0IgIVviCek7TTWrZs3db8pU="}},"text":"However, specific expectations, such as real-time tracking, still need to be met.90% of customers want immediate updates and real-time order visibility.Adopting technological solutions can improve delivery

centers can be challenging and pricey, it pays off in the long run by reducing shipping costs and providing an efficient and cost-effective service.Leading 3PL companies are already reaping the benefits of this strategy and improving their overall performance.Last Mile Delivery\nLast-mile delivery accounts for 53% of the total shipping cost, and 3PLs simply can’t afford to miss the mark here.The final stage of the delivery process is where customer satisfaction and profitability are either made or broken.Unfortunately, too many managers responsible for supply chain and digital functions face significant challenges in this crucial area.But fear not; there are solutions.By partnering with the right players, businesses can meet and exceed their customers’ expectations while boosting their bottom line.That’s why we offer Veho’s efficient and cost-effective last-mile delivery solutions.By prioritizing necessary orders and reducing failed deliveries, Veho can make money while delivering the high level of service customers deserve while saving your 3PL money on last-mile delivery.Factor 3 | Warehouse Teams and the Packing Process\nWhen it comes to the efficiency of a warehouse, it’s essential to have a well-oiled team handling the packing process.After all, warehouse teams can make or break the whole operation.Here are some questions to ask yourself regarding your teams.Are you investing in training your team?Training is crucial for a proficient team, minimizing staff turnover, and boosting profits.It should cover SOPs, equipment handling, inventory management, customer order systems, and obtaining certification for specific tasks.How efficient is your packing station?Regularly assess your packing station’s efficiency to identify areas for improvement and reduce labor costs.Implement one-touch stations and focus on ergonomic design and workflow to optimize productivity and reduce errors.Are you optimizing your picking paths?Optimizing your picking paths might be the key to unlocking higher profit margins for your business.It’s simple – a slower picking process leads to increased picking costs, inevitably leading to higher product prices for your customers.Are you using automation?While a 95% to 98% order accuracy rate may seem reasonable, it still allows for a 2% margin of error or potentially even worse outcomes.These errors can result in significant financial losses for your warehouse.Fortunately, implementing warehouse automation can reduce human error and improve inventory control.This will significantly enhance picking accuracy, bringing it closer to 100% and ultimately saving you money by reducing mistakes and mispicks.Are you analyzing the correct data?Measuring data is crucial to improve business operations.Knowing your warehouse’s key performance indicators (KPIs) is essential.Collecting and analyzing the correct data identifies inefficiencies and avoidable expenses.You’ll need to track everything from receiving through shipping to get a complete picture of your operations.Here are a few KPIs to consider:\nInventory Days of Supply: The day’s sales of inventory (DSI) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time, in days, that a company takes to turn its inventory, including goods that are a work in progress, into sales.Parcel Bill Accuracy: Review your parcel bill charges regularly to avoid overcharging.Request detailed bills from carriers if you spot any errors.This information can be helpful when renewing shipping contracts.Receiving Efficiency: This metric determines how well the receiving area performs overall.It is determined by the volume of inventory received/ number of hours worked.So, for example, you may receive 2000 goods per week and only have two employees at 40 hours each.So in this example, it would be 2000/80 = 25 goods per hour being processed.Order Picking Accuracy: Accuracy in order picking is vital to ensure that orders are shipped correctly.Mistakes can be costly and time-consuming, so tracking this metric is crucial to keep customers happy and avoid the hassle of correcting errors.Warehouse Capacity Utilization: Warehouse capacity means the space available to store things.Businesses need to use the area efficiently and save money on warehouse operations.To understand your warehouse capacity utilization, you can calculate it in a few easy steps.Ideal utilization is 80%, which is average to maximize your warehouse space.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"21S9x5uskYSw47VkGqD6LHjepG7gP+q9paGf8l6HI+k="},"e26ec568-5278-40b2-be33-9fb098ece11e":{"id_":"e26ec568-5278-40b2-be33-9fb098ece11e","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/5-factors-affecting-your-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e629c712-3695-4574-a008-73f6b4326aaa","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/5-factors-affecting-your-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"W0nQ2Jiju3IiWINPmD9sMnBw8S6l6MSCHnoQS3zZqX8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d046e0d4-c27b-4bc7-ab46-ac2aa84a92b9","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/5-factors-affecting-your-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"4AuITEQkp2+KzHDd6Gbfl1WbycScrnbofQIMSs+Wj5Y="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ba172330-7d71-4372-85fd-7fc0706f3e77","metadata":{},"hash":"8sBaNDokYWwlScchBn/WF8TExQLWaa1H1ctSH4tzav8="}},"text":"This

save money on warehouse operations.To understand your warehouse capacity utilization, you can calculate it in a few easy steps.Ideal utilization is 80%, which is average to maximize your warehouse space.To calculate your warehouse’s usable space:\nMeasure the total square footage, clearance height, and unusable areas (offices, bathrooms, break rooms).Subtract the unusable square footage from the total to get the usable square footage.Multiply it by the clearance height to obtain the usable volume in cubic feet.Factor 4 | Special Handling Fees \nAs a shipper, you’re no stranger to handling fees for hazardous materials and fragile items.But did you know that these fees can have both advantages and disadvantages?Let’s take a closer look at how they can impact your bottom line.Hazmat\nRevenue Generation: Shippers can generate extra revenue through Special Handling fees, which help cover the expenses of safely transporting fragile or hazardous items.These fees contribute to the overall profitability of the shipping industry.Risk Management: To transport hazardous and delicate items safely, shippers should charge special handling fees, conduct inspections, and employ trained personnel.Risk management practices are essential to ensure secure transportation.Competitive Advantage: Shipping companies specializing in hazardous and delicate items can become industry leaders by charging extra for their expertise.This draws customers seeking experienced shippers with a deep understanding of complex shipments.Shipping hazmat and fragile items can be profitable, but shippers must address customer concerns and competition while complying with regulations.Fragile\nWhen it comes to shipping fragile items, there’s no room for error.After all, damaged items don’t just impact your bottom line – they can also significantly affect your reputation.That’s why taking proactive steps is essential to ensure your items arrive at their destination in one piece.One way to do this is by enlisting the help of your special projects team to assemble kits or pre-assemble your items.Factor 5 | Surcharges \nSurcharges are a necessary evil in shipping and logistics, so they can be the bane of your bottom line if you’re not careful.That’s why it’s essential to be informed and proactive about the different types of surcharges your product lines may encounter.Navigating outbound shipping can be a complex and costly process for 3PL operators.Negotiating base rates with carriers is just the beginning; understanding accessorial charges and selecting the best base rate based on package specifications is key to mitigating costs.The challenge lies in the surcharges associated with specialized services, which can drive up costs and make it challenging to predict expenditures.Additionally, general rate increases can significantly impact carrier base rates for 3PLs.However, the right approach and tools can reduce shipping expenses.By utilizing shipping cost strategies, analyzing costs, and planning, surcharges can be minimized.How to Reduce Shipping Charges\nSize and Weight\nIt is important to be mindful of shipping charges, as they can quickly add up and cut into your profits.One way to reduce these costs is by considering the size and weight of your parcels.Oversized boxes or improper packaging can result in higher fees.Look for carriers that offer the correct type of flat-rate shipping or the fees that make the most sense for you and your products.Additionally, be aware of dim weight pricing (as we discussed at the top of this article), which considers the box’s length, height, and weight.This can sometimes result in extra fees for light packages that take up a significant amount of truck space.Team Training\nReducing shipping charges is crucial for businesses of all sizes, and optimizing warehouse operations can help achieve this goal.Proper software training is essential to maintain consistency with the packing team and reduce unnecessary costs.A warehouse management system (WMS) like ShipHero can provide automation that streamlines business operations, but it needs to be used accurately.Your WMS training program should cover all aspects of the hardware and software and the different methods used to manage goods efficiently within the warehouse.By emphasizing the importance of WMS training and implementing consistent warehouse practices, your business can reduce shipping costs and improve overall efficiency.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"btdoeKgOW/lUzEN4YCuZmko0Wmeg06sAF+alWwKIDag="},"ba172330-7d71-4372-85fd-7fc0706f3e77":{"id_":"ba172330-7d71-4372-85fd-7fc0706f3e77","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/5-factors-affecting-your-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e629c712-3695-4574-a008-73f6b4326aaa","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/5-factors-affecting-your-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"W0nQ2Jiju3IiWINPmD9sMnBw8S6l6MSCHnoQS3zZqX8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e26ec568-5278-40b2-be33-9fb098ece11e","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/5-factors-affecting-your-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"+IMVE6dia3ky4srYpbKy0IgIVviCek7TTWrZs3db8pU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b87f882f-882f-48f3-9592-eae08956874c","metadata":{},"hash":"KAC4yg3W46SoWTnNgid8BPTqumXE2CQTvoHdziERH/U="}},"text":"Look

scales and improperly stocked packing stations can also enable you to minimize touchpoints and increase automation.With automation rules, packers can always use the appropriate box when shipping specific products.These steps allow you to confidently assert control over your shipping process and save valuable business resources.Automation\nWe offer a variety of automation rules to help businesses save money on shipping charges.Our VIP customer treatment rule ensures that your most valuable customers receive a gift SKU or marketing insert with their orders, express shipping, and prioritized order processing.Our pre-sale item rule helps businesses save by setting a partial shipping flag for orders that exceed a specific dollar amount.Additionally, SKU-specific notes can be assigned to certain items, which is handy for fragile items that require special handling.Finally, we automate box type selections, streamlining the packing process and saving businesses time and money on shipping.With the proper automation rules, businesses can significantly reduce shipping charges and improve their bottom line.3PL Profitability\nTo summarize, consider all five critical factors mentioned in this post to reduce your outbound shipping costs: destination and origin, delivery speed, warehouse team processes, special handling fees, and surcharges.With the right tools and expertise, you can ensure that your 3PL profitability remains reliably on track.And with hard work and dedication to intelligent decisions about outbound shipping strategies—increasing or decreasing

delivery challenges can be solved with partnerships like Veho, which can save money and streamline the process.Delivery speed is important for eCommerce businesses, but faster delivery times come with higher costs.Local fulfillment centers and efficient processes can help reduce costs.Investing in team training, efficient packing procedures, optimizing picking paths, using automation, and analyzing the correct data can improve warehouse efficiency and reduce costs.Hazmat and fragile handling fees can protect businesses from fines and reputation damage, but choosing the proper packaging and labeling is vital.Understanding surcharges and negotiating base rates can help mitigate shipping costs for 3PL operators.Planning and analyzing costs can also minimize surcharges.About ShipHero: We

calculate shipping costs\nShipping cost calculators for shipping carriers\nShipping cost calculation FAQs\nHow 3PLs reduce shipping costs\nConclusion\nWith the ecommerce industry booming and competition increasing every day, customers have increased expectations about the online shopping experience and the order fulfillment process.Of course, platforms like Amazon set the bar for both ecommerce merchants and couriers alike with their impressive overnight and 2-day shipping policies.For small businesses, pulling off quick delivery times can put a lot of pressure on your logistics operations.Unless you have a network of fulfillment centers and a big labor force, fulfilling orders to get delivered in a cost-effective manner is going to be tough.So, how can you manage shipping costs to profitably ship orders and not lose sales to major brands?This article will take you through the basics of shipping costs and how you can correctly estimate them through different factors and tools.How to calculate shipping costs\nThe total shipping costs depend on the basic information of the package that you’re shipping and on the declared value of the products inside.However, the total cost often depends on many other complex factors as well.Here are a few factors that contribute to the shipping rates that popular courier services offer.Package dimensions\nThe package dimensions, such as length, width, and height, are usually multiplied together to calculate the dimensional or volumetric weight of the package.The size of the package usually determines the shipping rate per cubic foot and different box sizes are marked with different shipping costs.Package weight\nIf the actual weight of the package outweighs the dimensional weight calculated from the standard formula, then the actual weight of the package is used as the billable weight and the shipping costs are based on that.Thus, the larger the package is, the higher its shipping costs.Package destination\nAdditionally, the shipping costs depend on the destination country and the destination zip codes.For some zones, the shipping costs are usually higher.Like in the United States, shipments to Hawaii and Alaska are often more expensive than in the continental states.The total costs depend on the zone distance which is calculated by counting the shipping zones between the point of origin and the destination.Value of contents shipped\nOften, packages with a high declared value require shipping insurance.This is also true for expensive products and dangerous goods that require their own packaging to be shipped in that isn’t standard.The parcel handling-related charges add to the shipping-related charges, resulting in higher shipping costs in total.Expected delivery time\nFor most couriers, premium and fast shipping get more expensive the more zone distance there is to cover.For example, overnight shipping in the same zone might not be as expensive as overnight shipping to some destinations five zones away, as that would probably require air shipment for fast shipping.The standard post delivery to the same destination might cost less but it would take longer for it to be shipped.Shipping cost calculators for shipping carriers\nThe above-mentioned factors are usually what popular shippers use to estimate shipping costs.Many ecommerce platforms have their own shipping calculator, like the Shopify shipping calculator that gives instant shipping quotes for a package.Let’s take a look at some of the carriers.USPS shipping rates and shipping calculator\nUSPS is among the cheapest carriers in the USA, especially for ground shipping.The post office sends daily rounds for shipments and this is the reason that USPS offers fast deliveries at such modest rates, making it one of the best deals out there.USPS offers a variety of deals based on the mail classes like priority mail, flat-rate shipping with envelopes and different boxes, etc.\nYou can use the USPS Shipping calculator to get shipping quotes from the courier on domestic/APO/FPO and international shipping.FedEx pricing and shipping calculator\nFedEx is another popular carrier service in the US and Canada.FedEx offers a variety of delivery deals ranging from same day to overnight shipping, and from ground to air shipment.The FedEx Small Business program offers shipping solutions to small businesses and the rewards program offers shipping discounts.FedEx shipping costs are based on the dimensional weight of the packages.You can check the FedEx shipping cost calculator on their website to estimate shipment charges.UPS pricing and shipping calculator\nUPS is another popular courier service in the United States.UPS shipment ranges from the UPS ground to UPS 3-Day Select or 2nd Day

logistics and warehouse management services, small businesses can enjoy major savings on shipping costs.So, how exactly can you save on shipping costs by outsourcing your fulfillment, you ask?Let’s take a look!Discounted shipping rates\nBecause 3PL companies manage order fulfillment for several clients and handle plenty of daily shipments, they often have agreements for discounted rates with carriers.This way, they can offer their clients discounted shipping rates as well.Most 3PLs don’t charge extra fees for the discounts, so you can rest assured that you won’t be charged extra for shipping with a 3PL.Distributed inventory\nBecause of distributed inventory, ecommerce business owners can have inventory stored at different warehouses in different shipping zones.This makes fast shipping easier as the inventory can be sourced from the closest warehouse upon the placement of the order and the extra fuel charges can be avoided.Basically, orders will be sent to the warehouse closest to the customer to improve delivery speeds and reduce transportation costs.2-day delivery and overnight delivery\nAdditionally, these fulfillment companies are often able to offer overnight and 2-day delivery options, thanks to the above-mentioned factors.This helps small businesses compete with Amazon and other large brands that have the fulfillment network capable of delivering orders

also depend on what carrier you are partnering up with.The good thing is that these things can often be estimated to great accuracy with the help of internet tools.To sum things up, shipping costs,

Fulfillment\nAre your outbound shipping costs eating your 3PL’s profits?Today, we will cover five critical factors affecting your shipping costs and provide actionable tips to help you reduce them.We’ll give insights on everything from delivery speed to special handling fees to ensure you make operational decisions that save time and money.Factor 1 | Weight and Zone\nFor products shipped domestically within the US, two key factors come into play: the destination zone and the package’s weight.Zone\nCarriers have established nine zones across the US, with the origin address as Zone 1.Your shipping fees increase as your package moves further from its origin.Here are the current zones with their mileage differences from the source.Zone 1: 1-50 miles\nZone 2: 51-150 miles\nZone 3: 151-300 miles\nZone 4: 301-600 miles\nZone 5: 601-1000 miles\nZone 6: 1001-1400 miles\nZone 7: 1401-1800 miles\nZone 8: 1801 miles or greater\nZone 9: US territories & APO or FPO addresses\nWeight \nWhen it comes to shipping packages, weight matters, it’s a simple concept: the heavier the package, the more you’ll have to pay to get it where it needs to go.But it’s not just about weight; the package’s dimensions also play a significant role.It’s a tricky balance – you want your package to be the right size to hold your products but not so large that it triggers DIM weight surcharges.Investing in a packaging design strategy is worth the time to determine the optimal package size and weight to avoid unnecessary expenses.It’s a small step that can significantly impact your bottom line.Shipping Calculators by Carrier:\nUSPS: Shipping Calculator\nCanada Post: Shipping Calculator\nFedEx: Shipping Calculator\nUPS: Shipping Calculator\nInternational\nIf you’re not taking advantage of duty relief programs for international shipping, you’re leaving money on the table.The numbers don’t lie – Section 321 alone can save you up to 20% on duty fees, and that’s a significant amount.So, what exactly is Section 321 all about?Section 321 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act has revolutionized the eCommerce shipping costs for shippers from Canada or Mexico sending goods into the U.S.to individual customers.With tax and duty exemptions, faster clearance, and reduced paperwork, shippers have remarkable advantages at their fingertips.Section 321’s duty-free entry for goods valued at $800 USD per person per day is a smart way for businesses to grow, as it offers savings for brands looking to get their items to American consumers.While certain products are restricted, these regulations should not deter businesses from enjoying the benefits Section 321 can bring.Factor 2 | Delivery Speed \nThe persistent and aggressive growth in eCommerce demands a seamless process to satisfy customers’ needs, and delivery speed is an essential aspect of any business that hopes to keep up with customer demands in today’s marketplace.Margin integrity is crucial if you want to stay profitable.At ShipHero, we understand that maintaining a delicate balance between cost and delivery speed is essential for our margins to remain healthy.It hasn’t been an easy process, and we’ve made our fair share of mistakes.Nevertheless, we’ve learned that customers expect two-day delivery from Amazon but are generally willing to wait three to four days for other businesses.However, specific expectations, such as real-time tracking, still need to be met.90% of customers want immediate updates and real-time order visibility.Adopting technological solutions can improve delivery experiences and lower consumer inquiries.32% of global shoppers will abandon their carts if an estimated shipping time is too long.Rising standards are forcing 3PLs and carriers to reevaluate traditional distribution models.Fulfillment Trends\nGet ahead of the trend by utilizing micro-fulfillment centers (MCFs) to cut delivery times.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rr9ehGK35zdC87eEll2DtLo+jlIprpwK2InB8lQ/RUU="},"caaca56a-2052-4f12-b2b0-ffac555ccf17":{"id_":"caaca56a-2052-4f12-b2b0-ffac555ccf17","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/tag/shipping-rates/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6b28c09e-8520-4acb-8f5c-fbbf46678ad5","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/tag/shipping-rates/"},"hash":"JD4rP91ALGCVaXGfVR2ms2p3UuQ0PN5oasxOlST9KOw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8f20c9ae-c05e-4c98-bfc8-00a8848b79a4","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/tag/shipping-rates/"},"hash":"l4olT7LJN6D5ou5XUrzz/3Uf8GlxUOz/ZHsQzgE+jdk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"831d2fb1-c3ca-438d-8a3e-63c94702de0a","metadata":{},"hash":"nvX0U06NFVhDKMVe4bazxn37YoPxifjl2uoZzrCpc0c="}},"text":"Margin

carriers to reevaluate traditional distribution models.Fulfillment Trends\nGet ahead of the trend by utilizing micro-fulfillment centers (MCFs) to cut delivery times.MCFs are strategically placed in urban areas and stocked with popular products, making it easy for customers to pick up their online orders.This gives shippers the flexibility to meet rising consumer expectations promptly.Although setting up these local centers can be challenging and pricey, it pays off in the long run by reducing shipping costs and providing an efficient and cost-effective service.Leading 3PL companies are already reaping the benefits of this strategy and improving their overall performance.Last Mile Delivery\nLast-mile delivery accounts for 53% of the total shipping cost, and 3PLs simply can’t afford to miss the mark here.The final stage of the delivery process is where customer satisfaction and profitability are either made or broken.Unfortunately, too many managers responsible for supply chain and digital functions face significant challenges in this crucial area.But fear not; there are solutions.By partnering with the right players, businesses can meet and exceed their customers’ expectations while boosting their bottom line.That’s why we offer Veho’s efficient and cost-effective last-mile delivery solutions.By prioritizing necessary orders and reducing failed deliveries, Veho can make money while delivering the high level of service customers deserve while saving your 3PL money on last-mile delivery.Factor 3 | Warehouse Teams and the Packing Process\nWhen it comes to the efficiency of a warehouse, it’s essential to have a well-oiled team handling the packing process.After all, warehouse teams can make or break the whole operation.Here are some questions to ask yourself regarding your teams.Are you investing in training your team?Training is crucial for a proficient team, minimizing staff turnover, and boosting profits.It should cover SOPs, equipment handling, inventory management, customer order systems, and obtaining certification for specific tasks.How efficient is your packing station?Regularly assess your packing station’s efficiency to identify areas for improvement and reduce labor costs.Implement one-touch stations and focus on ergonomic design and workflow to optimize productivity and reduce errors.Are you optimizing your picking paths?Optimizing your picking paths might be the key to unlocking higher profit margins for your business.It’s simple – a slower picking process leads to increased picking costs, inevitably leading to higher product prices for your customers.Are you using automation?While a 95% to 98% order accuracy rate may seem reasonable, it still allows for a 2% margin of error or potentially even worse outcomes.These errors can result in significant financial losses for your warehouse.Fortunately, implementing warehouse automation can reduce human error and improve inventory control.This will significantly enhance picking accuracy, bringing it closer to 100% and ultimately saving you money by reducing mistakes and mispicks.Are you analyzing the correct data?Measuring data is crucial to improve business operations.Knowing your warehouse’s key performance indicators (KPIs) is essential.Collecting and analyzing the correct data identifies inefficiencies and avoidable expenses.You’ll need to track everything from receiving through shipping to get a complete picture of your operations.Here are a few KPIs to consider:\nInventory Days of Supply: The day’s sales of inventory (DSI) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time, in days, that a company takes to turn its inventory, including goods that are a work in progress, into sales.Parcel Bill Accuracy: Review your parcel bill charges regularly to avoid overcharging.Request detailed bills from carriers if you spot any errors.This information can be helpful when renewing shipping contracts.Receiving Efficiency: This metric determines how well the receiving area performs overall.It is determined by the volume of inventory received/ number of hours worked.So, for example, you may receive 2000 goods per week and

keep customers happy and avoid the hassle of correcting errors.Warehouse Capacity Utilization: Warehouse capacity means the space available to store things.Businesses need to use the area efficiently and save money on warehouse operations.To understand your warehouse capacity utilization, you can calculate it in a few easy steps.Ideal utilization is 80%, which is average to maximize your warehouse space.To calculate your warehouse’s usable space:\nMeasure the total square footage, clearance height, and unusable areas (offices, bathrooms, break rooms).Subtract the unusable square footage from the total to get the usable square footage.Multiply it by the clearance height to obtain the usable volume in cubic feet.Factor 4 | Special Handling Fees \nAs a shipper, you’re no stranger to handling fees for hazardous materials and fragile items.But did you know that these fees can have both advantages and disadvantages?Let’s take a closer look at how they can impact your bottom line.Hazmat\nRevenue Generation: Shippers can generate extra revenue through Special Handling fees, which help cover the expenses of safely transporting fragile or hazardous items.These fees contribute to the overall profitability of the shipping industry.Risk Management: To transport hazardous and delicate items safely, shippers should charge special handling fees, conduct inspections, and employ trained personnel.Risk management practices are essential to ensure secure transportation.Competitive Advantage: Shipping companies specializing in hazardous and delicate items can become industry leaders by charging extra for their expertise.This draws customers seeking experienced shippers with a deep understanding of complex shipments.Shipping hazmat and fragile items can be profitable, but shippers must address customer concerns and competition while complying with regulations.Fragile\nWhen it comes to shipping fragile items, there’s no room for error.After all, damaged items don’t just impact your bottom line – they can also significantly affect your reputation.That’s why taking proactive steps is essential to ensure your items arrive at their destination in one piece.One way to do this is by enlisting the help of your special projects team to assemble kits or pre-assemble your items.Factor 5 | Surcharges \nSurcharges are a necessary evil in shipping and logistics, so they can be the bane of your bottom line if you’re not careful.That’s why it’s essential to be informed and proactive about the different types of surcharges your product lines may encounter.Navigating outbound shipping can be a complex and costly process for 3PL operators.Negotiating base rates with carriers is just the beginning; understanding accessorial charges and selecting the best base rate based on package specifications is key to mitigating costs.The challenge lies in the surcharges associated with specialized services, which can drive up costs and make it challenging to predict expenditures.Additionally, general rate increases can significantly impact carrier base rates for 3PLs.However, the right approach and tools can reduce shipping expenses.By utilizing shipping cost strategies, analyzing costs, and planning, surcharges can be minimized.How to Reduce Shipping Charges\nSize and Weight\nIt is important to be mindful of shipping charges, as they can quickly add up and cut into your profits.One way to reduce these costs is by considering the size and weight of your parcels.Oversized boxes or improper packaging can result in higher fees.Look for carriers that offer the correct type of flat-rate shipping or the fees that make the most sense for you and your products.Additionally, be aware of dim weight pricing (as we discussed at the top of this article), which considers the box’s length, height, and weight.This can sometimes result in extra fees for light packages that take up a significant amount of truck space.Team Training\nReducing shipping charges is crucial for businesses of all sizes, and optimizing warehouse operations can help achieve this goal.Proper software training is essential to maintain consistency with the packing team and reduce unnecessary costs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tXAXdGP6Unzm9GgpEule8ZIhF7mgQw3yhjO/uW+Upws="},"b1406058-caca-407c-b25f-25a6f0dd9b63":{"id_":"b1406058-caca-407c-b25f-25a6f0dd9b63","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/tag/shipping-rates/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6b28c09e-8520-4acb-8f5c-fbbf46678ad5","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/tag/shipping-rates/"},"hash":"JD4rP91ALGCVaXGfVR2ms2p3UuQ0PN5oasxOlST9KOw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"831d2fb1-c3ca-438d-8a3e-63c94702de0a","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/tag/shipping-rates/"},"hash":"nvX0U06NFVhDKMVe4bazxn37YoPxifjl2uoZzrCpc0c="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3c485054-c3c6-47f1-aa5b-0366caf692ef","metadata":{},"hash":"cID35djgIwV98Ej6FDezY0yD5G9rt6VSsoYSQ+CMElo="}},"text":"By

accurately.Your WMS training program should cover all aspects of the hardware and software and the different methods used to manage goods efficiently within the warehouse.By emphasizing the importance of WMS training and implementing consistent warehouse practices, your business can reduce shipping costs and improve overall efficiency.Equipment\nTroubleshooting internal errors such as incorrect scales and improperly stocked packing stations can also enable you to minimize touchpoints and increase automation.With automation rules, packers can always use the appropriate box when shipping specific products.These steps allow you to confidently assert control over your shipping process and save valuable business resources.Automation\nWe offer a variety of automation rules to help businesses save money on shipping charges.Our VIP customer treatment rule ensures that your most valuable customers receive a gift SKU or marketing insert with their orders, express shipping, and

Handle Shipping for You\nConclusion\nFree Shipping Supplies FAQs\nShipping customer orders on time is one of the most critical parts of your fulfillment process.And it’s vital to optimize the shipping process to keep customers happy.Consumers are always looking for brands that offer them faster shipping times with minimal shipping costs (thanks, Fulfillment-By-Amazon.)While meeting these expectations isn’t always easy, business owners can lower shipping costs by reducing costs at individual stages of the fulfillment process.One part of the shipping process where business owners can cut costs is packaging by getting their hands on free shipping supplies.There are a few promising ways to score some serious free shipping supplies, and we’ll take a look at those now!How to Choose the Right Shipping Supplies\nGood shipping practices balance safety and budget.Your packaging needs to ensure that items arrive safely, but you can’t use too many shipping supplies because it’ll raise costs.Here, we’ll take a look at the three critical elements of good packaging for product shipping:\nContainers\nYou have two main types of containers when shipping products, which are boxes and mailers.To ensure your items arrive safely at their destinations, you want them to fit snugly in their containers, so choose the smallest box possible.In addition to ensuring your items’ safety, small shipping boxes incur lower shipping costs.Cushioning and Void Fill\nCushioning like bubble wrap, air pillows and packing peanuts fill the empty space in your containers, so your items don’t get jostled around during transit.Whichever cushioning method you choose, ensure that your products stay in place while the box is being moved so they won’t get damaged.Special Care for Fragile or Irregular Items \nSome items need special treatment to ensure their safety during transit.Here are some ways you can handle fragile or irregular items:\nMultiple items in one box: Wrap each item with foam or bubble wrap so they don’t get scratched when bumping into each other during transit.Delicate or fragile items: Wrap especially fragile items in bubble wrap or styrofoam sheets and fill the box with packing peanuts to ensure they stay in place.Items with sharp edges: Dull the edges by placing folded cardboard or using a reinforced double-wall box to prevent the edges from breaking the packaging.Wallpaper, posters, or rugs: You can’t fold items that shouldn’t have creases.Instead, roll them up and deliver them in tubular shipping boxes.Where to Buy Cheap Shipping Supplies \nYou may need to buy your own shipping supplies if you handle shipping and delivery without third-party logistics.Here are some great places to get packaging materials and supplies:\nLocal Stores\nIf you’re only shipping a few items, your local office supply or stationery stores usually sell the things you need.Prices between stores may vary, so shop around to find the best deal.Big Box Stores\nBig box stores like Target and Walmart have locations all over the country, which makes shopping for shipping supplies easier.These stores also offer bulk shipping supplies for reasonable prices.Amazon\nOnline retailer Amazon sells all kinds of shipping supplies, from poly mailers to cardboard boxes, at reasonable prices.For instance, a 25-pack of cardboard boxes is just $21.99 and can go even lower if you have the relevant coupons.Additionally, Amazon also accepts cryptocurrency payments via BitPay.eBay\neBay offers self-branded packing supplies like boxes, mailing envelopes and packaging tape to help its sellers deliver their goods.While it’s easy to access, eBay Shipping Supplies doesn’t have the best prices – a set of 25 cardboard boxes costs $31, for example.To find better deals, you may need to look through eBay listings and search for sales and auctions that sell low-priced packing supplies.Carriers That Offer Free Shipping Supplies\nMany different carriers offer business owners free shipping supplies.One thing to keep in mind with each carrier is they only let you get free supplies if you use their services.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"orrPKDgfgwn/yJsexNFLwivK/Thld4dbAiBjsw4EGMU="},"0b2d29b3-5199-4334-9e6e-7b22ce0081b5":{"id_":"0b2d29b3-5199-4334-9e6e-7b22ce0081b5","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/free-shipping-supplies/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"fc1f84c4-3428-4e45-bd39-9d8a3789089f","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/free-shipping-supplies/"},"hash":"Cp5DR5JLckkpEV5wtwm7OZd4XjcZn8T1QArDwBzhAaA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6a58670b-f5a4-4baf-b10f-ea6b5cfbd6fb","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/free-shipping-supplies/"},"hash":"orrPKDgfgwn/yJsexNFLwivK/Thld4dbAiBjsw4EGMU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fd2f6154-e334-457d-ac6e-4f7a9be567ac","metadata":{},"hash":"wm2+/zdjo8VUDh0la10Z30JqJsRgMLKv4+VQMQNISsc="}},"text":"These

That Offer Free Shipping Supplies\nMany different carriers offer business owners free shipping supplies.One thing to keep in mind with each carrier is they only let you get free supplies if you use their services.For example, you can’t walk into the UPS store with FedEx’s packaging and expect them to let you ship it.Let’s see what each one is offering.How to Get Free Shipping Supplies From UPS\nThe advantage of working with a UPS store is they provide different boxes for each category of mail services.All you have to do is walk into your local UPS store, and they’ll provide packages for free.How to Get Free Shipping Supplies From FedEx\nYou can get free shipping supplies from FedEx by going to their retail locations or ordering shipping supplies online.The packaging is complimentary when you ship with FedEx.Are FedEx Boxes Free?Yup!FedEx offers free shipping boxes and free shipping supplies in great variety.These boxes are free in small, medium and large sizes.How to Get Free Shipping Supplies From USPS\nThe United States Postal Service offers shipping boxes and envelopes for free through its website.You can get boxes and envelopes in various USPS-standard sizes, which makes shipping easier if you deliver products through USPS.However, there is a restriction to keep in mind when getting free boxes from USPS.When shipping your products, your mailing service must match the service listed on the package.For instance, using a Priority Mail Express flat rate envelope means you can only use USPS Priority Mail Express service.Which Shipping Boxes Are Free at the Post Office?The free boxes at the US Post Office include different USPS Priority Mail Boxes like the priority mail medium flat rate box and other free USPS boxes like the small flat rate box and the large flat rate box.Where to Get Poly Bags for Shipping\nYou can buy poly bags wherever shipping supplies are sold.Some of the best places to look for poly bags include:\nLocal stationery stores or dollar stores\nLarge retailers like Walmart and Target\nAmazon\neBay\nDoes USPS Have Free Poly Mailers?The USPS does not offer free poly mailers, but you can get similar items like padded envelopes from its website.USPS Poly Mailer Shipping Costs\nPoly mailers are often used for lightweight items, so the cost of shipping poly mailers is generally very affordable.If you’re using USPS First Class Mail, shipping a package under 13 oz starts at $0.49.How to Get Free Shipping Supplies from DHL\nDHL is one of the most prominent names in international shipping.If you have a DHL account, you can order free shipping supplies from its website.Available items include boxes of various sizes, envelopes, flier bags and waybill sleeves.Tips to Keep in Mind With Carrier Packaging\nFree carrier packaging is excellent, but it’s not a ‘no-strings-attached’ deal.Here’s what to keep in mind when using free supplies from carriers.Use Specific Mailing Services\nWhen you’re getting free shipping supplies from a carrier, it’s often complementary, which means you are limited to a specific mailing service.Again, you can’t expect to get free supplies from FedEx if they know you’ll ship with UPS.Use Only Specific Carriers\nCarrier-supplied free boxes come with shipping labels and stamps, so other carriers can’t use these boxes.Don’t Order More Supplies Than You Need\nWe know it’s tempting, but carriers offer free shipping supplies and expect etiquette from their customers.So, don’t order more supplies than you need, even if they’re free.If it takes too long to get shipping supplies, head to your nearest customer center to pick up the supplies when needed.Alternative Methods to Get Free Shipping Supplies\nIf you don’t want to commit to a carrier, there are other ways you can find free shipping supplies.Reuse Old Packages\nA great and cost-effective way to source your packaging is to look for reusable old packages and take off their old shipping labels.You can look up free packaging ads on websites like craigslist to reuse packaging that would have otherwise gone to the landfill.Get Old Boxes from Local Stores\nYou can get free shipping supplies and old boxes from local stores.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Ref5rK6rsTTJwfiOlSbrujlJYzWkYDmRKEOji6BVIrg="},"fd2f6154-e334-457d-ac6e-4f7a9be567ac":{"id_":"fd2f6154-e334-457d-ac6e-4f7a9be567ac","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/free-shipping-supplies/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"fc1f84c4-3428-4e45-bd39-9d8a3789089f","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/free-shipping-supplies/"},"hash":"Cp5DR5JLckkpEV5wtwm7OZd4XjcZn8T1QArDwBzhAaA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0b2d29b3-5199-4334-9e6e-7b22ce0081b5","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/free-shipping-supplies/"},"hash":"X+8SUWMr+Fq6tL4l42C4aQiJMJKneEiZgpknfq153eI="}},"text":"Use

Before Shipping Large and Heavy Items\nWhat’s an Oversized Item?How to Ship Large or Oversized Items\nLet ShipHero Handle Heavy Item Fulfillment\nShipping Heavy Items FAQs \nConclusion\nProviding customers with fast shipping options is vital to success, but for items on the heavier side, this can end up costing you an arm and a leg.Small packages?Those are easy to ship, and major carriers often give you nice discounts on them.But what about the big stuff?When it comes to the shipping process, big carriers have come prepared to efficiently manage the logistics of oversized shipping.USPS and FedEx can even have heavy items delivered by the next business day.But at what cost?Well, there’s a blueprint that you can follow to cut heavy package shipping costs down significantly and avoid unwanted expenses.If you trim the costs down from all around, the result is noticeable savings.How to Ship Large Items\nThe right packing method ensures the safety of your large items.Here are four shipping strategies for oversized products:\nUse Sturdy Boxes\nNaturally, heavier and larger items need sturdier boxes.Always use new boxes when shipping large items because secondhand boxes may have some wear and tear on them.If you can’t find double-walled or reinforced boxes, pack your original box in a larger box to add extra protection layers.Make sure to add extra cushioning with bubble wrap or packing peanuts between the boxes to minimize movement during transit.Seal With Heavy-Duty Packing Tape\nDon’t be cheap by using duct tape or masking tape.When sealing boxes containing large objects, always use heavy-duty packing tape to seal every seam of your box so it won’t break open.Calculate Package Dimensions and Cost\nOversized shipping can be expensive, so calculate your package’s weight, length and girth before going to the mail carrier.Once you have the package’s dimensions, you can calculate a shipping estimate and know how much money to prepare.Consider Dividing the Shipment if Possible\nSometimes, sending your items in several boxes is cheaper than sending all of them in one box, even if there’s only one recipient.Consider dividing your shipment if the cost of shipping several boxes at once is cheaper than sending all the items in one box.What to Consider When Shipping Heavy Items\nWhen it comes to shipping heavy items and figuring out how to cut costs, you first need to ask, what am I being charged for?Knowing what factors count towards the shipping rates helps you direct your attention towards trimming these costs.Dimensional Weight\nThe concept of dimensional weight was introduced around 2015, and it differs from your package’s actual weight.Dimensional weight is a theoretical weight that factors into your package’s dimensions.Shipping companies adopted this model because they lost money on large packages that weighed less.How does this concern you?Well, when your shipping partner calculates the shipping fees, they will take the greater of the two weights – dimensional or actual – into account.If your package weighs less than its dimensional weight, that’s what you’ll be charged for – so this is important to look into beforehand.Fragility of Items\nIf the goods you are having delivered are damaged during the shipping process, then that’s going to send your costs sky-high.Damaged goods mean expensive returns and refunds, which you really want to avoid.So if you’re looking to ship items that need extra care, find a carrier that offers commendable fragile shipping services.Origin and Destination of the Package\nBig or small, the shipping fees you pay on a package will always incorporate the shipping zone into the calculation.This means that if the package travels a long distance to reach the customer, it will cost you more.How can you cut these costs down?Opt for a distributed inventory!You can dramatically reduce shipping costs with distributed fulfillment centers in strategic locations.Carrier Being Used\nThe shipping costs you pay also depend on which carrier you’re using.Some are more generous when it comes to shipping oversized or fragile items, while others aren’t so much.Type of Service Being Used\nShipping fees also depend on the shipping services you’re going for.Is it a 2-day delivery?Is it next-day delivery?Does the product need to be shipped internationally?Also, the price increment for shipping zones varies with the type of service.So, your zone-to-zone shipping fees for 2-day delivery may not increase as much as for overnight delivery.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5gdOr2y7Y/KdhItkvsB2bc56ukPted/s+zCMvXapNMw="},"cd83bc63-7a14-438e-b7d9-2e3a5e4a79c4":{"id_":"cd83bc63-7a14-438e-b7d9-2e3a5e4a79c4","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ad4af4fb-e2a3-4d01-a4eb-d7325297b96e","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"hash":"tDpQvoppxU7xgwEUHf1MVa94p4pS5vdEK10Tg6feuaQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dcf84bfd-9fd6-4b89-b4e8-c6253a13730e","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"hash":"5gdOr2y7Y/KdhItkvsB2bc56ukPted/s+zCMvXapNMw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fff61eca-49da-4499-97d2-25e822a90ae6","metadata":{},"hash":"KBRn0FE3LAFarCGjXVE3JM51ze8jmGl2ip0cunumdfk="}},"text":"Origin

oversized products:\nReduce Package Weight\nHeavier packages are more expensive to ship.While you can’t reduce your product’s weight, you can use lighter packaging to cut shipping costs.Some good ways to reduce package weight are:\nPack items in corrugated cardboard boxes.Use lightweight cushioning like air pillows and bubble wrap.Design custom lightweight packages that fit your products perfectly.Reducing your package weight may only save you a few cents per package, but the savings add up, and you’ll save hundreds of dollars in the long run.Buy Appropriately-Sized Packages\nMany businesses adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to packaging, where they buy a lot of big boxes and use them to ship everything.While convenient, using large boxes to ship small products means paying more because of the bigger packages.Instead of adopting a one-size-fits-all approach, you can buy several types of boxes that perfectly fit all your products and use them appropriately.This approach cuts down your average package size, meaning you’ll save on shipping costs.Choose Flat-Rate Shipping\nFlat-rate shipping means the delivery cost is always the same, regardless of the package’s dimensions.If you can get a reasonable flat-rate shipping cost, you don’t have to worry about selling oversized products anymore because you’ll be charged the same regardless of package size.Provide Local Delivery and Pickup\nIf your business sells locally, you can provide local delivery or curbside pickup to people in your area.Since you can assign staff to deliver products or have buyers come to pick their purchases up, you can reduce or even eliminate the cost of shipping.Best Way to Ship Large, Heavy Items\nMajor carriers have their own prices and services for shipping heavy and oversized items; one carrier isn’t necessarily better than another across the board.You need to determine which carrier specifically offers you the best package for what you’re shipping.Carriers such as USPS, UPS and FedEx provide services to small businesses and even individuals, so they put their prices up in the open for you to see easily.But freight carriers such as DHL and FedEx freight that focus on serving large businesses don’t have their prices up publicly, so you need to contact them for a quote.Here are some things to consider when choosing a carrier to ship oversized items:\nPackage dimensions: Your package’s size is the first thing that determines your shipping rates.Choose a carrier that offers reasonable rates for large packages.Item fragility: If you’re shipping fragile items, choose a carrier service renowned for delivering fragile shipments safely.Services offered: Depending on your client base, you may need specialized services like next-day delivery or international shipping.Choose a carrier that provides all the services you need.Shipping Services for Large Items \nMany carriers offer large item shipping solutions for your business, but each offers different benefits.Here, we look at three of the best large item shipping companies available today:\nUSPS\nThe United States Postal Service (USPS) is the largest carrier, so it should be no surprise that they offer pretty diverse shipping solutions to cater to different needs.Priority Mail: 1-3 days\nThe USPS Priority Mail option is available for items that weigh 70 pounds and under, and the packages range from small envelopes to large boxes of around 1 ft x 1ft x 6 inches.If you’re looking to send a heavy item that is small or medium-sized in a reasonable amount of time, then the Priority Mail option is a good choice.While it’s not the fastest option, the delivery service gets the items to your customers within 1-3 days, which is great.Priority Mail Express: Overnight\nThe Priority Mail Express is USPS’s fastest shipping option, where orders are guaranteed to reach your customers by the next business day.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"sWYlDA2kTg36Zn7SWCiKEhSZqyHfEjXJqwtatS0SoAA="},"fff61eca-49da-4499-97d2-25e822a90ae6":{"id_":"fff61eca-49da-4499-97d2-25e822a90ae6","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ad4af4fb-e2a3-4d01-a4eb-d7325297b96e","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"hash":"tDpQvoppxU7xgwEUHf1MVa94p4pS5vdEK10Tg6feuaQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cd83bc63-7a14-438e-b7d9-2e3a5e4a79c4","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"hash":"dyeXgt7eE3AlCMiHFD+nOkYGX6OWUM/lu5ihvHzsX1g="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a4b9e022-2c9d-4add-8e38-40b126bc5396","metadata":{},"hash":"wQwMU26gDS52H5dOZ/kEoJKvfpBF2+gW8i3jrzCEGaw="}},"text":"Here,

fastest shipping option, where orders are guaranteed to reach your customers by the next business day.For packages under 70 pounds, the Priority Mail Express option is good if you can fit the item into the flat rate shipping envelope.Otherwise, the prices are pretty high for larger packages, and you might be better off with a different carrier.Media Mail: 2-10 days\nMedia Mail is a niche-specific shipping option from which select eCommerce businesses can benefit massively.With Media Mail, media items such as CDs, DVDs and books can be shipped at extremely affordable rates – the best rates you’ll find.So if you’ve got some heavy media items that need to be delivered, Media Mail is your best bet.Ground: 2-8 days\nIf your package is too big to fit in the Priority Mail flat rate box, then enter the Ground shipping option.This option still limits you to 70 pounds, but the size limits are less restrictive.As you can see, the trade-off is that Ground shipping is a lot slower than Priority Mail.The prices are calculated depending on the shipping zone and weight.FedEx\nSince we’re discussing major carriers, it should be no surprise that FedEx made it to the list.Ground: 1-7 days\nFedEx doesn’t offer you the same guaranteed speed options as USPS, but they make up for it by offering you more liberal weight options.Unlike USPS, which limits you to 70 pounds, FedEx is far more generous, giving you the option to ship items as heavy as 150 pounds.They’re also more relaxed about package sizes – letting you ship items as large as 108 inches long or 165 inches for length plus girth.So if your items are too big or too heavy for USPS, then head on over to FedEx.Freight: Priority or Economy\nIf you’re shipping heavy items in large volumes, FedEx’s Freight option is one of the best picks.The prices vary immensely, depending on the product’s size and the shipping zone, but you’ll get an exceptional rate if you’re shipping a lot of oversized items.DHL\nNeed international shipping taken care of effectively?Enter DHL, one of the best freight shipping carriers out there.Air Freight\nDHL’s Air freight option has your goods delivered through flights that are scheduled along major routes.The best part about the Air freight service is that there are many options to choose from depending on your needs.Need door-to-door, airport-to-door, or door-to-airport delivery taken care of?DHL will manage all three.If speed is a priority, then Urgent Air Freight will have your delivery taken care of in just 1-2 business days.If you’re not in a rush, then Air Economy takes care of shipments within 5-7 days.If you have special cargo or temperature-sensitive items, DHL has options for those too, including delivering shipments in temperature-controlled environments.Ocean Freight\nSimilar to the Air freight option, the Ocean freight service is great for shipping heavy items in bulk, except overseas rather than by air.The two main options are Full Container (FCL) and Less Than Container (LCL), but they offer special options for freight shipments like temperature-controlled environments and transportation facilities for liquids.Our advice?If you’re looking to send big, bulky items in large quantities, then freight shipping is the way to go.What to Do Before Shipping Large and Heavy Items\nBefore shipping large and heavy items, it’s important to ensure they are properly secured and in packages of the right dimensions.This involves using the right amount of dunnage where appropriate, and if you’re shipping fragile items, opt for something like bubble wrap to keep it safe.Large and heavy items are usually more costly, so you really can’t afford to have them damaged in shipping.What’s an Oversized Item?A package is considered ‘oversized’ when it’s either too large, too heavy, or a combination of both.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gQD4uLZT7xijXNAdr+HvXvSVLH2GqS2QU5mO3+EzcRk="},"a4b9e022-2c9d-4add-8e38-40b126bc5396":{"id_":"a4b9e022-2c9d-4add-8e38-40b126bc5396","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ad4af4fb-e2a3-4d01-a4eb-d7325297b96e","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"hash":"tDpQvoppxU7xgwEUHf1MVa94p4pS5vdEK10Tg6feuaQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fff61eca-49da-4499-97d2-25e822a90ae6","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"hash":"KBRn0FE3LAFarCGjXVE3JM51ze8jmGl2ip0cunumdfk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c41cb7b8-b9df-4c69-a2ab-aeedbdc12680","metadata":{},"hash":"Y/A/8xovzP54yFJfux/A+kxCU5hXEef1s7F9sd7AwBk="}},"text":"The

package is considered ‘oversized’ when it’s either too large, too heavy, or a combination of both.Carriers traditionally consider packages oversized if the item’s length and girth are greater than 165 inches, if the goods weigh more than 150lbs, or if the length is greater than 108 inches.However, many carriers now limit the combined length to 130 inches.Let’s see what each carrier considers ‘oversized.’USPS Oversized\nUSPS classifies items as oversized if they have a length of 108 inches and no more than 130 inches combined length and girth.For this range, businesses pay a standard Parcel Select oversized fee which is reasonable.Beyond these dimensions, though, you’ll have to contact USPS for a specific quote.USPS specifies oversized items by dimensions but not weight.UPS Oversized\nUPS has three criteria for classifying an item as oversized; if its weight is more than 150lbs, if the length alone is more than 108 inches, or if the combined length and girth exceed 165 inches.If your package dimensions or weight fall under these conditions, then you will have to pay UPS’s Over Maximum Limits charges subject to DIM.FedEx Oversized\nFedEx classifies items as oversized if the length exceeds 96 inches or 130 inches in length plus girth.Dimensional weight calculations apply to oversized product calculations, and there is a minimum 90lbs village weight charge too.While FedEx still lets you ship oversized products by ground, there is an oversized shipping charge of $90 per parcel.Also, during annual peak shipping times, an additional charge called the oversized peak surcharge ($37.5 per package) is applicable too.So, FedEx may not be the most cost-effective option.DHL Oversized\nDHL classifies an oversized item as one that exceeds 70kg (around 155lbs) in weight or has any one dimension that exceeds 120 cm (that’s 47.24 inches).So, for oversized classification, DHL considers all the dimensions rather than the length.The oversized package cost is $89, but they have different services available that you can contact them about.How to Ship Large or Oversized Items\nWhen it comes to shipping your large or oversized items, there are two things to prioritize; 1) keep the shipping fee as low as possible and 2) minimize the risk of damage.The steps themselves are quite straightforward:\n1.Package Your Item Properly\nThis goes without saying, but we’ll mention it anyway – make sure that your items are secured in place and with great care.2.Take Measurements\nRemember how we discussed the dimensional weight pricing model earlier?Well, when getting your items ready for shipping, look for the most efficient packaging option.This will not only help you score a lower shipping fee but is also important for keeping the goods safe.If your package dimensions are off relative to the items inside, then they might get tossed around during shipping and consequently damaged.3.Weigh Your Package\nWeigh your package beforehand so you know exactly what pricing options it falls under.Is your package too heavy to be shipped by USPS’s conventional options, for example?Weighing your package is an important part of determining the right carrier and shipping option.4.Calculate Rates\nCalculate the rates that you will have to pay depending on the options available to you.Can you afford to go for the express options, or will that cut your profit margins down?Is one carrier giving you a better rate for your product’s dimensions?5.Book and Pay\nNow that you’ve worked out which option is best for shipping your package, go ahead and book it!6.Print Your Shipping Labels\nPrint your shipping labels out and fill the required details in – where is the package going to, how much does it weigh, etc. Different carriers have different shipping labels, so fill them in as required.7.Label Your Package\nPut the labels on your package so that they’re ready to go!8.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NFG7QsoqMRkZHafg/NqbP2QSFcOo8XnbXPAhajDGQ5U="},"c41cb7b8-b9df-4c69-a2ab-aeedbdc12680":{"id_":"c41cb7b8-b9df-4c69-a2ab-aeedbdc12680","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ad4af4fb-e2a3-4d01-a4eb-d7325297b96e","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"hash":"tDpQvoppxU7xgwEUHf1MVa94p4pS5vdEK10Tg6feuaQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a4b9e022-2c9d-4add-8e38-40b126bc5396","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-items-without-ruining-profits/"},"hash":"wQwMU26gDS52H5dOZ/kEoJKvfpBF2+gW8i3jrzCEGaw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b02c4ad7-4b71-4d30-b1ad-f2ac1a94bd09","metadata":{},"hash":"Rj1m1K56CclkqFIx3Am8nt/TdlQY8AnO5dagFIa9vB8="}},"text":"Is

Items FAQs \nHow much does it cost to ship 100 lbs?This depends on what carrier you are using.For example, FedEx considers a 100 lbs package oversized, so a $90 oversized fee will apply.However, carriers like DHL and FedEx may not consider this package oversized, so that shipping costs will be lower.What is the cheapest way to ship heavy items?There is no single cheapest way to ship heavy items.Many factors come into play, including the package dimensions, package weight, dimensional weight, the type of items and whether or not you have a distributed inventory.A reliable logistics solution partner can help you find the most cost-effective way to ship heavy items.How do you ship heavy items cheaply?To ship heavy items cheaply, you need to reduce as much weight as you can.That’s why large items must be properly packaged in boxes, parcels or containers of the right dimensions.The packages need to be weighed and measured so that you can determine the most cost-effective way to have them delivered.Correctly labeling packages before shipping them off is vital to make sure they reach the right destination.How much does it cost to ship a 25-pound box?This depends on many factors, including the carrier, the shipping option you are using and where the box is going.For example, let’s look at USPS’s Parcel Select Ground option, which is one of the slowest and most cost-effective delivery options.The 25-pound box can cost anywhere from $25 to above $70, depending on the shipping zone it’s headed.Conclusion\nShipping heavy and oversized items involves far more

Resilient Shipping\nWhat Is a Resilient Supply Chain?Building Supply Chain Resiliency\nWrap up\nShipHero recently launched The Fulfillment Innovation Wheel to help 3PLs understand what capabilities and service offerings they need to implement in order to be successful and to help online retailers and brands choose which 3PL is right for them by allowing them to ‘check the boxes’.The Fulfillment Innovation Wheel listed a set of twelve (12) capabilities that fulfillment providers and logistics companies should implement to continually delight their customers and push themselves towards greater success and innovation.The twelve capabilities are:\n2-Day Delivery\nSame Day Shipping\nAt the Box Personalization\nDesigned for Returns\nSustainable Fulfillment\nResilient Shipping\nDistributed Fulfillment\nData Now\nAutomation\nScale Up and Out\nIntegration Stack\nProfessional Services\nIn this article, we will be diving into Capability #6: Resilient Shipping.And be sure to stay tuned for future articles as we deep-dive into each capability.Capability #6: Resilient Shipping\nIs your business sufficiently protected from supply chain risks like extreme weather events, supplier disruptions, and well…pandemics?COVID-19 has certainly had an immense impact on global trade and domestic supply chains, but this hasn’t been an isolated incident, with SARS, measles, swine flu, ebola and avian flu all resulting in similar yet less severe business interruptions at a global level.Moreover, domestic supply chains are frequently plagued by extreme weather events, supply shortages, and carrier delays.Supply chain resilience refers to a company’s ability to conduct normal business operations despite sudden disruptions or unexpected events that negatively affect supply chains and order fulfillment.Resilient supply chains are also able to quickly recover from outages and achieve pre-disruption levels of functionality.As an example, many FBA merchants use ShipHero for FBM to avoid stock outs, maintain emergency inventory stockpiles, and provide diversified fulfillment options.In this article, let’s uncover how businesses can build a resilient supply chain and delivery network.What Is a Resilient Supply Chain?To start building your roadmap towards supply chain resiliency, you need to know what a resilient supply chain looks like.According to a recent study, these are the five core principles of a resilient supply chain:\nRapid detection, response, and recovery.Your business must be able to quickly detect events, identify optimal response options, and achieve full-scale recovery.Complete oversight and control.Your business should have end-to-end visibility into your supply chain, along each step of the fulfillment journey, as well as the ability to take action quickly.Preparation for any scenario.Your business must prepare for a disruption before it happens with documented incident response plans, complete with specific steps and responsible parties for each scenario.Built-in redundancies and continuity.Your business must be able to account for process failures and bottlenecks, and provide additional surge capacity when disruptions arise.Intelligent demand planning.Your business can proactively avoid disaster scenarios with distributed fulfillment and effective inventory management.Are these five principles present when looking at your own supply chain?If you outsource your fulfillment, ensure that your fulfillment provider can guarantee a resilient supply chain with the above principles.If your business fulfills in-house or you are a 3PL provider, consider building in the following practices for a resilient supply chain.Building Supply Chain Resiliency\nHope for the best, plan for the worst.Your business can minimize damage from supply chain risks with the following best practices: \nMap Out Your Fulfillment Processes\nBy documenting your end-to-end fulfillment process, you have a powerful visual tool to understand your supply chain and identify any possible pain points.Consider creating a process diagram and list relevant people at each step.As for data, how does information flow through your supply chain?Is it automated?Or does it heavily rely on the copy/pasting of a single employee?By creating a full picture of how data flows through your supply chain, you can identify possible bottlenecks or dependencies that could inflict serious damage to your supply chain in times of crisis.Consider creating a process diagram of how data moves around your business (i.e., data flow diagram) and list relevant people at each step.Get Inventory Insight and Control\nIs your inventory where it should be at any given moment?Proper inventory management helps you avoid surplus inventory gathering dust on warehouse shelves and accumulating storage fees, while guarding against stock-outs and shortages in certain regions.Not to mention, intelligently distributed inventory allows you to reduce shipping costs and decrease delivery times.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"M4gsZN0WUJ/q3DnQWcCJLSGRmrXsLzQWMzzlhkv1h0c="},"a389ecef-0770-4e3d-a9ce-1f701cb19654":{"id_":"a389ecef-0770-4e3d-a9ce-1f701cb19654","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/the-fulfillment-innovation-wheel-resilient-shipping/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a6c43222-ff85-4b2c-87f4-ece22498469e","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/the-fulfillment-innovation-wheel-resilient-shipping/"},"hash":"lqQdxG8xycGBWni1nb1CYsmO3hKB9KhBpvqkuGIEI/A="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"afe8e96b-5b46-49d1-8b4c-60d0b0973eb2","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/blog/the-fulfillment-innovation-wheel-resilient-shipping/"},"hash":"M4gsZN0WUJ/q3DnQWcCJLSGRmrXsLzQWMzzlhkv1h0c="}},"text":"Consider

stock-outs and shortages in certain regions.Not to mention, intelligently distributed inventory allows you to reduce shipping costs and decrease delivery times.Consider investing in modern inventory management software to get oversight and control of your inventory, or switch to a fulfillment provider, like ShipHero, that uses advanced warehouse management software across their network of fulfillment centers.Build Automation Rules\nIn times of crisis, stressful or crunch-time decision making is very susceptible to human error.Automation can eliminate human interference in your core business processes, while leaving room for intervention when needed.Consider implementing automation rules in your inventory management software; for example, automation rules can help place orders with the most cost-efficient suppliers when inventory hits certain levels, or automation can be used to choose the optimal delivery carrier when many face delays.Provide Real-Time Collaboration\nDo you have the ability to access and share supply chain information in real-time?Being able to access up-to-date information and reporting enables better decision-making and emergency planning.Consider implementing procedures and systems to get the right data to the right decision makers.Manage Product Returns\nProduct returns introduce a lot of complications in your supply chain, including unpredictable inventory levels, increased costs, and reduced conversions — and this is amplified during situations of surging demand or delayed shipments.With a more effective return strategy (i.e., reverse logistics), your business will be more prepared for when the ship hits the fan.Consider designing your supply chain and inventory management process with returns built in, or switching to a fulfillment provider that offers return credit and advanced reverse logistics capabilities.Wrap up\nWith the above best practices in place, your data-driven supply chain will be optimized for resiliency, and be able to quickly detect, respond to, and recover from any sudden supply chain disruptions.Our customers love that ShipHero provides a resilient and data-driven supply chain that can offer 2-day shipping anywhere in the contiguous United States at simple and transparent pricing.We also prioritize ground shipping, making for an eco-friendly supply chain.We attribute this success on

(Won’t) Stop\nSince taking the reins of the prolific video game distributor back in January, Ryan Cohen, co-founder of online pet food company Chewy Inc, has made quick work of fast-tracking GameStop’s e-commerce capabilities.The company announced Monday that it will expand its fulfillment network with a 700,000 sq-ft facility on, you guessed it, the moon.Jk close though, it’s in York, Pennsylvania\n“This facility is expected to be operational by the fourth quarter of 2021 and will support e-commerce and fulfillment needs,” the company said in a news release.“The Company expects its fulfillment center in York, Pennsylvania will position it to grow product offerings and expedite shipping across the east coast.”New Player Has Entered Chat\nBeyond building out its fulfillment network, Cohen has ousted the former C-suite and ushered in a new team of current and former Amazon employees to support the transformation.Despite the recent stock market saga that captured the hearts of many Reddit users, the GameStop brand remains strong in the video game space, and this switch could further bolster the companies earnings.In fact, GameStop recently reported that its global e-commerce sales surged 175%, representing 34% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.The New Age of Brick-and-Mortar\nEven before the pandemic, it seemed that physical brick-and-mortar retail stores were a thing of the past and soon to be outdated.The yearlong lockdowns may have expedited things a bit, but the reality was/is that retailers were scrambling to find a way to utilize their large real estate footprint.Retail Tycoon IRL\nStores like GamStop are uniquely positioned to turn their retail stores in micro-distribution centers for fast and inexpensive local delivery.And other brands are starting to do the same, as ShipHero COO Maggie Barnett explains in an interview with Vogue Business.“Some of our large beauty and fashion brands have a prolific real estate footprint, so they want to leverage that — even if people aren’t necessarily visiting those stores at 100 percent capacity,” Barnett says.Check out the full article here.Back of the Packet\nMmm …Union Rings\nOn Wednesday, Trump-era rules were nullified that made it more difficult for a gig worker to be classified as an employee under federal law.When a gig worker is classified as an employee, they are covered by federal minimum-wage and overtime laws.It also means that these workers are better positioned to organize into labor unions — and creating union jobs has been a top priority for the Biden administration.Ebay-bay\nThe eCommerce platform is looking into cryptocurrency as a payment option, as well as exploring the realm of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).And they say eBay is shady ????Bezos News\nJeff Bezos is building a gigantic luxury yacht that’s expected to be one of the best in the world – and he’s adding a ‘support yacht’ with its own helipad.We get it, he’s single now.Bill Gates plans to get girls in attendance by pinging their newly implanted 4G chips in their arm.Moving on.Belgium Invades France\nBy moving a 200 year old boulder by about 7.5 feet, a farmer in Belgium accidentally re-routed the country’s border with France — the stones were placed to mark the border after an 1820 treaty.Belgian authorities light-heartedly warn that the farmer may face

industry growing rapidly, many things about the field have seen significant improvement in the past few years.Companies have been working to ensure a better customer experience with improved technology and better shipping options.Quick delivery times with low shipping costs are vital to optimize customer satisfaction levels.But how can you offer faster shipping times without compromising profits?The topic of faster shipping brings us to expedited shipping and the advantages it offers over standard shipping services.Here’s what ecommerce retailers should know about the workings of expedited shipping.What is expedited shipping?Expedited shipping refers to shipments that are faster than the standard option for delivery.The actual term means different things for different carriers and can refer to one-day or two-day delivery options.As such, expedited shipping charges to domestic or international destinations vary with the various delivery services.How fast is expedited shipping?Different delivery options with various carriers usually come with their specific strategy for the whole supply chain.Depending on the type of product and the shipping zone distance between the point of origin and destination, the delivery times of expedited shipping can vary with each carrier.Is expedited shipping worth the added cost?The expedited service option usually comes with added cost for the lesser delivery times that increase with the shipping zone distance and the parcel’s weight and dimensions.Some businesses hold customer satisfaction in high regard and feel that the expedited shipping option is worth it.Of course, faster delivery times add to the whole charm of the sale for the customer and can increase your company’s revenue.The differences between expedited and standard shipping\nStandard shipping usually costs the least when it comes to different delivery services.The standard service could translate to a two-day shipping time for some companies, while others might offer longer delivery times for their standard shipping.The standard delivery option for one of the most popular carriers in the US, the USPS, consists of ground shipping and usually takes more than two business days for farther shipping zones.Reasons to offer expedited shipping\nExpedited shipping provides a guarantee to your customers that their packages will be shipped in reduced transit times.This reduction in transit time directly increases customer satisfaction, and it is arguably one of the most important reasons businesses opt for this shipping method.However, there are other advantages to expedited shipping as well.To save time\nThe primary purpose of expedited shipping is to save on shipping time.Carriers often do this by minimizing the supply chain to the final destination.If your customers are willing to pay more for faster shipping, expedited shipping is the suitable business method for your setup.Shipping perishables\nMany perishable items like frozen food and baked items require faster shipping so that the products do not expire during the shipping process.For this reason, expedited shipping is the correct answer for your business if you are involved with the food industry.To win (or retain) customers\nIf most of your customers opt for faster shipping methods and are willing to pay the extra cost, then you should look into making expedited shipping into your standard shipping option.There is a chance that retailers might lose customers who want faster shipping if they don’t offer expedited shipping.Save on storage costs\nTaking the products from the manufacturers and storing the inventory in warehouses often comes with detailed storage charges.When you offer expedited shipping, the products spend less time in storage, and you can save on inventory storage costs.Reduce abandoned carts \nUnsatisfactory delivery options directly link to cart abandonment among prospective customers.Having various shipping options such as expedited and standard shipping lets the customers choose the shipping option they like.Therefore, it’s wise to offer expedited services to your customers.Meet customer expectations around ship time\nCustomers usually look at a couple of retail options before buying something, and they often go with the retailer that provides convenient delivery options.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XKdquuM01+P+NpzIpDDVYvoAkTI5tExiahJuBuETe6o="},"ec9dd8a7-61f7-4661-ad10-6d5a00a10254":{"id_":"ec9dd8a7-61f7-4661-ad10-6d5a00a10254","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a89645d8-093a-45eb-880a-38c38953ba5b","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"hash":"1ydvg4ubaSPJFsTpIfIOa61x452zTsKUnq9XCrgF+ww="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bcd41f3c-7d1c-4661-8b65-19b8fc7e0faa","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"hash":"RoFIVi2ORLXXMwKXzh5S8owXQ1ha0/6QXa9+hBh8LkE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c38a2522-9d69-44a5-aa42-5c28417cfc9a","metadata":{},"hash":"RdXIdk24NX4ZrNzEi7nAgJs6o1LqpjHtIplMmaRuQHM="}},"text":"To

couple of retail options before buying something, and they often go with the retailer that provides convenient delivery options.Today, faster shipping methods like Amazon’s next-day delivery options have increased customer expectations, and this is why not having expedited shipping could hurt your sales.Build customer loyalty\nCustomer satisfaction is the key to getting repeat customers and building customer loyalty.When the customers get their parcels delivered faster, they are more likely to purchase from your shop again in the future.Offering expedited shipping options could enhance the customer loyalty in your consumer base and possibly secure future sales.How fast is expedited shipping compared to other fulfillment options?Different delivery services come with different standard and premium delivery times.Let’s look at some of the popular shipping options and how they fare compared with expedited shipping.Expedited shipping vs. standard shipping delivery speeds\nStandard shipping services are often the cheapest shipping option out there, but they also take many business days to deliver the package, depending on the shipping zone distance.On the other hand, expedited shipping offers reduced shipping times while being more costly.Some companies have two-day delivery as their standard shipping options, while others take longer in their standard delivery service.These options vary from company to company.Expedited shipping services vs. express shipping delivery speeds\nDepending on what carrier service you are looking at, expedited and express delivery can be used interchangeably or mean the same thing.Couriers usually have a variety of standard and premium delivery options, and these terms vary depending on their context of use.Two-day (or next-day) shipping \nFor some companies like Amazon Prime, two-day shipping options are standard, while for others, two-day delivery often falls under the umbrella of expedited shipping.Like the other terms, these terms also vary with each courier.Which shipping carriers offer expedited shipping?Many carriers offer different expedited shipping services like flat-rate shipping, ground shipping, and next-day air shipping options.Let’s look at some of the most popular carriers in the US and their expedited shipping services.USPS expedited shipping\nUSPS is among the most popular courier services in the US for domestic delivery.A popular expedited shipping option by USPS is their Flat Rate Priority Mail Express.This mail service comes with options like overnight and next-day delivery options, and you can track the parcel during shipment.UPS expedited shipping\nUPS is another shipper that offers expedited shipping options for domestic delivery, including same-day, next-day, and two-day shipping guarantees.The UPS Worldwide Expedited service offers faster delivery to international destinations.FedEx expedited shipping\nFedEx also provides several expedited shipping options based on the package’s size and dimensions, destination, and urgency.These shipping options include FedEx Express Saver, and FedEx Expedited Freight, and the FedEx Same Day service.How to offer expedited delivery\nIt might seem that expedited delivery is impossible for small businesses to offer and might kill your budget.But there is a way to provide expedited delivery without any extra burden on your budget – and here’s how.Use distributed fulfillment centers\nHaving your inventory stored in multiple fulfillment centers means that you can minimize the shipping zone distance from the warehouse to the destination.This way, you can use ground shipping methods from the nearest warehouse for the expedited shipping option.Require a minimum purchase amount for orders\nTo cover the shipping costs for expedited shipping, a smart thing to do is set a minimum order purchase threshold.This way, you can cover the marginal shipping cost from the products’ revenue while keeping your customers happy.Work with an experienced 3PL\nAnother way to save on shipping costs is to work with an experienced third-party logistics (3PL) company that can get you discounted shipping rates with major carriers.Other than the discounted shipping rates, a 3PL can help cut back on shipping costs by making the process more efficient.Experienced 3PL partners offer shipping options and technology that you might not have been able to manage on your own.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"m+8PjKHJvJNDqEp94JW0RuXWm9iBhNgKukop9dKDUOs="},"c38a2522-9d69-44a5-aa42-5c28417cfc9a":{"id_":"c38a2522-9d69-44a5-aa42-5c28417cfc9a","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a89645d8-093a-45eb-880a-38c38953ba5b","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"hash":"1ydvg4ubaSPJFsTpIfIOa61x452zTsKUnq9XCrgF+ww="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ec9dd8a7-61f7-4661-ad10-6d5a00a10254","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"hash":"eVONHd5k+qKo8pdoV3zTw4lwtg8WdAe5lVWudsL3ZoA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"97ab2ce3-0c87-4827-acc0-45a29baa9f54","metadata":{},"hash":"AQU1oBHWL+4Bhb7MI7/He7HDA0EGjo7iW3WIb0SebRw="}},"text":"Use

essence, it’s simply a group of people bonded together by common ideas and shared values.In a business sense, a company is only as good as the glue that holds it together, bonded through a shared mission, a vision to strive towards, and the belief that the joint effort of a company will result in prosperity well beyond the capacity of an individual.So what happens when the frustrations start to mount, and your business is brought to the very brink of “do or die”.Well that’s what happened for E-Commerce Xpress, a third party logistics (3PL) provider located in South Queensland, Australia that specializes in guiding small to medium-sized businesses through the initial growth phase of logistics — ranging from women’s apparel and winter clothing, to home gym equipment (booty bands, resistance bands, water bottles, etc).>”Shipping 200 orders felt like such a struggle.Our staff definitely shared the frustration.To put it in perspective there was one fairly high volume period where in an 8 hour shift, someone tracked 12.5km on their Fitbit for the day.”E-Commerce Xpress Cofounder and GM\n12.5km …for those of us not on the metric system, that’s about one third of a marathon.After this particularly stressful event, the good people at E-Commerce Xpress decided it was time for a hero to sweep them off their aching feet — a ShipHero that is.We were enticed by their story and sat down with Anger, Jordi Anger, Cofounder and GM of E-Commerce Xpress.Here’s our interview.ShipHero: Mr.Anger, could you please calmly provide a brief description of your business 🙂\n“We are very simply a 3PL/fulfillment centre located in South Queensland, Australia.We specialise in fulfillment and inventory management for small to medium-sized e-commerce brands who are going through those initial

most flexible service possible for our clients.”Before switching to ShipHero, what were the challenges that made you want to just rip your hair out?“We were using another 3PL company, which initially sounded like the best suit for us at the time.Unfortunately, the transparency was not there and by the time we had switched to live we found that we couldn’t use their product to its fullest potential.“As a result we had to go pay for a completely separate platform just to be able to generate labels and ship orders.So we couldn’t pick Multi-batch, we had to become a paper reliant warehouse, we couldn’t fulfill orders through the one system and we had next to no support, which are all the things we were initially sold on.The main frustration was that–”\nUh oh.“Anyway, the main frustration was that because of this, the time it took to ship 200 orders for example was ridiculous.From memory it would take about 4 of my staff about 4-5 hours to completely fulfill 200 orders.My staff definitely shared the frustration.“To put it in perspective there was one fairly high volume period where in an 8 hour shift, someone tracked 12.5km on their Fitbit for the day.This was simply because the walk-time they had to do for each order was essentially the same each time due to not being able to use the multi-batch order feature.”And…how did that make you feel?“Agitated”.Phew.How about after the switch to ShipHero?“The week we went live with ShipHero we did the same amount [200 orders] in about 2 hours.As of right now, even less.After the switch, the amount of efficiency we were operating at was, and still is, truly amazing.That would be our biggest area of improvement, along with now becoming a paperless warehouse which is really important to us.“The only way this is possible is by partnering with a platform that had similar values like ShipHero.We see ShipHero as an extension of our team as well, and so far they haven’t let us down.”Ha …we’re honestly terrified to let you down.So when searching for a fulfillment partner, what did you consider as important criteria?“Customer service is always a must!In this industry, it’s very common for small issues to arise every day so we needed to make sure we had a really good support team by our side, and more importantly, an on-boarding team that could teach us to problem-solve ourselves!“We also wanted a modern and easy to navigate interface that would be simple for our employees to learn as well as our clients.There are a lot of outdated WMS that we came across that are really hard to grasp.“Finally, cost is an obvious factor.There are a lot of services out there that have a lot of hidden fees that once you start operating, it’s clear that those services are necessary.”What made you finally choose ShipHero?“Liam Dillon (CoFounder) and I had been watching and sharing some of ShipHero’s YouTube videos and really liked how they were explaining and demonstrating the pick-and-pack processes.We decided to do a bit more research on ShipHero and found that they have a 3PL-specific WMS platform.“We had already had multiple meetings with other platforms but none were the right fit.ShipHero stood out to us immediately as we could see that they weren’t ‘stuck in the past’, and really provided a fun and modern aspect to 3PL and fulfilment.“Not to mention, the pricing structure was super easy to understand and really cost efficient, which was a huge plus!”How was the integration process with ShipHero?“Our last WMS had a 6 week on-boarding period to get set up and learn the system, with

hours!","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gz37xIni55wg33/xOcSJYtY+9pPVKhjzYMtpkUUTs24="},"a95a82c2-df5e-4c66-b63c-6300ad33f0d1":{"id_":"a95a82c2-df5e-4c66-b63c-6300ad33f0d1","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a89645d8-093a-45eb-880a-38c38953ba5b","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"hash":"1ydvg4ubaSPJFsTpIfIOa61x452zTsKUnq9XCrgF+ww="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"97ab2ce3-0c87-4827-acc0-45a29baa9f54","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"hash":"AQU1oBHWL+4Bhb7MI7/He7HDA0EGjo7iW3WIb0SebRw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"59575761-2d18-4b27-8b64-5aa652350c54","metadata":{},"hash":"bqA1m2/qczCGrkXvTIjBJIonNIYk6RqOS3GY98k/b5I="}},"text":"What

going and was available via email, phone and even SMS.”Well don’t forget that they’re still around for whenever you need to manage your …systems.Finally, how was your business impacted by COVID-19?“We strangely launched our business throughout the COVID-19 period.We were pretty lucky here in our state that we were able to control the cases and still be able to provide essential work for the most part!“We were also super lucky to have two amazing clients that saw the benefit in utilizing our services throughout COVID-19 as their industry skyrocketed during this period.Liam already had a really good relationship with them previously so we were able to help them control their growth and provide an awesome service whilst they allowed us to grow with them and quickly build our operations into what it is today!”Amazing.Final thoughts, comments, words of praise, or outbursts?“In summary, we are super lucky to be able to partner with ShipHero, who is focused on continually making changes to benefit their users!I feel like every month there are new and updated features which might not seem like a big deal but benefit our warehouse processes dramatically.“We have been able to scale back our costs, time and effort ever since partnering with ShipHero, which at the end of the day has allowed us to focus on growth and perfecting our business’ services and operations.”Follow Liam and

competition increasing every day, customers have increased expectations about the online shopping experience and the order fulfillment process.Of course, platforms like Amazon set the bar for both ecommerce merchants and couriers alike with their impressive overnight and 2-day shipping policies.For small businesses, pulling off quick delivery times can put a lot of pressure on your logistics operations.Unless you have a network of fulfillment centers and a big labor force, fulfilling orders to get delivered in a cost-effective manner is going to be tough.So, how can you manage shipping costs to profitably ship orders and not lose sales to major brands?This article will take you through the basics of shipping costs and how you can correctly estimate them through different factors and tools.How to calculate shipping costs\nThe total shipping costs depend on the basic information of the package that you’re shipping and on the declared value of the products inside.However, the total cost often depends on many other complex factors as well.Here are a few factors that contribute to the shipping rates that popular courier services offer.Package dimensions\nThe package dimensions, such as length, width, and height, are usually multiplied together to calculate the dimensional or volumetric weight of the package.The size of the package usually determines the shipping rate per cubic foot and different box sizes are marked with different shipping costs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Ojl+wlTKD4cuWYRKDvWzRkQ/T83CFIWR4T1x1c9D2ak="},"59575761-2d18-4b27-8b64-5aa652350c54":{"id_":"59575761-2d18-4b27-8b64-5aa652350c54","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a89645d8-093a-45eb-880a-38c38953ba5b","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"hash":"1ydvg4ubaSPJFsTpIfIOa61x452zTsKUnq9XCrgF+ww="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a95a82c2-df5e-4c66-b63c-6300ad33f0d1","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"hash":"I3JfCQaYci6lz3LP/0RfdkXB2Aa71w1KV/dz3zs/4hQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4f21ef4e-e18e-4913-b705-a5f185286305","metadata":{},"hash":"gQ5o8Ms2RghXz/W5sHMS32a1jJ16WTRN9xyqS7FfX9s="}},"text":"Unless

length, width, and height, are usually multiplied together to calculate the dimensional or volumetric weight of the package.The size of the package usually determines the shipping rate per cubic foot and different box sizes are marked with different shipping costs.Package weight\nIf the actual weight of the package outweighs the dimensional weight calculated from the standard formula, then the actual weight of the package is used as the billable weight and the shipping costs are based on that.Thus, the larger the package is, the higher its shipping costs.Package destination\nAdditionally, the shipping costs depend on the destination country and the destination zip codes.For some zones, the shipping costs are usually higher.Like in the United States, shipments to Hawaii and Alaska are often more expensive than in the continental states.The total costs depend on the zone distance which is calculated by counting the shipping zones between the point of origin and the destination.Value of contents shipped\nOften, packages with a high declared value require shipping insurance.This is also true for expensive products and dangerous goods that require their own packaging to be shipped in that isn’t standard.The parcel handling-related charges add to the shipping-related charges, resulting in higher shipping costs in total.Expected delivery time\nFor most couriers, premium and fast shipping get more expensive the more zone distance there is to cover.For example, overnight shipping in the same zone might not be as expensive as overnight shipping to some destinations five zones away, as that would probably require air shipment for fast shipping.The standard post delivery to the same destination might cost less but it would take longer for it to be shipped.Shipping cost calculators for shipping carriers\nThe above-mentioned factors are usually what popular shippers use to estimate shipping costs.Many ecommerce platforms have their own shipping calculator, like the Shopify shipping calculator that gives instant shipping quotes for a package.Let’s take a look at some of the carriers.USPS shipping rates and shipping calculator\nUSPS is among the cheapest carriers in the USA, especially for ground shipping.The post office sends daily rounds for shipments and this is the reason that USPS offers fast deliveries at such modest rates, making it one of the best deals out there.USPS offers a variety of deals based on the mail classes like priority mail, flat-rate shipping with envelopes and different boxes, etc.\nYou can use the USPS Shipping calculator to get shipping quotes from the courier on domestic/APO/FPO and international shipping.FedEx pricing and shipping calculator\nFedEx is another popular carrier service in the US and Canada.FedEx offers a variety of delivery deals ranging from same day to overnight shipping, and from ground to air shipment.The FedEx Small Business program offers shipping solutions to small businesses and the rewards program offers shipping discounts.FedEx shipping costs are based on the dimensional weight of the packages.You can check the FedEx shipping cost calculator on their website to estimate shipment charges.UPS pricing and shipping calculator\nUPS is another popular courier service in the United States.UPS shipment ranges from the UPS ground to UPS 3-Day Select or 2nd Day Air.UPS prices, like that of FedEx, are also based on the dimensional weight of packages.Small businesses can often cash in on some shipping discounts through the UPS Connect program, which apply to both ground and air shipments.The UPS shipping calculator can be found on their website.Shipping cost calculation FAQs\nBy now, we’ve covered the basics of shipping charges and how they are calculated.In case you still have some questions about shipping cost calculation, here are some of the most frequently asked questions, answered.How do I calculate dimensional weight?The dimensional or dim weight is calculated by measuring the dimensions of the package and then dividing the total volume by a standard dim divisor.Popular shipping carriers like USPS, FedEx, UPS, and DHL, etc. base their shipping rates on the dimensional weight of the package.Can I ship flat rate?Yes, USPS has many offers for flat rate shipping where you can ship by putting your products in the standard flat-rate envelopes or the flat rate boxes in sizes small, medium, and large.How do I calculate shipping costs for USPS?Shipping costs on USPS can be easily calculated through the shipping calculator available on their website.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rTmeQyTAeQbjVp/B8onLOMepRfHVRIglSn4BJhUCQBs="},"4f21ef4e-e18e-4913-b705-a5f185286305":{"id_":"4f21ef4e-e18e-4913-b705-a5f185286305","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a89645d8-093a-45eb-880a-38c38953ba5b","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"hash":"1ydvg4ubaSPJFsTpIfIOa61x452zTsKUnq9XCrgF+ww="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"59575761-2d18-4b27-8b64-5aa652350c54","metadata":{"url":"https://shiphero.com/2021/05/page/4/"},"hash":"bqA1m2/qczCGrkXvTIjBJIonNIYk6RqOS3GY98k/b5I="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a4b7327a-c9da-4896-b340-04d2d26c0d8e","metadata":{},"hash":"yvGNWZnMR/l7nBg8hNBdK4W3yHXuO1CkHSruJvWw4kE="}},"text":"The

drop-down menu available on the website to estimate the shipping cost of the different shipping label deals offered by USPS.How do I get shipping discounts?Usually, third-party logistics companies have set deals with shipping carriers like USPS, UPS, and FedEx, etc. By using the services of a 3PL provider, you can often get shipping discounts through these couriers.Just sort out these details with your fulfillment provider.Which is the cheapest carrier to ship with?One of the cheapest carriers is the United States Postal Service or the USPS for short.Comparing the average shipping costs for FedEx, USPS, and UPS, it is clear the USPS is the cheapest option for both ground and air shipments.USPS also offers many shipping services like the Retail Ground, Priority Mail 2-Day, and Priority Mail Express, etc. The actual shipping quotes are present on the USPS website.How 3PLs reduce shipping costs\nBy teaming up with third-party logistics companies (3PLs) for logistics and warehouse management services, small businesses can enjoy major savings on shipping costs.So, how exactly can you save on shipping costs by outsourcing your fulfillment, you ask?Let’s take a look!Discounted shipping rates\nBecause 3PL companies manage order fulfillment for several clients and handle plenty of daily shipments, they often have agreements for discounted rates with carriers.This way, they can offer their clients discounted shipping rates as well.Most 3PLs don’t charge extra fees for the discounts, so you can rest assured that you won’t be charged extra for shipping with a 3PL.Distributed inventory\nBecause of distributed inventory, ecommerce business owners can have inventory stored at different warehouses in different shipping zones.This makes fast shipping easier as the inventory can be sourced from the closest warehouse upon the placement of the order and the extra fuel charges can be avoided.Basically, orders will be sent to the warehouse closest to the customer to improve delivery speeds and reduce transportation costs.2-day delivery and overnight delivery\nAdditionally, these fulfillment companies are often able to offer overnight and 2-day delivery options, thanks to the above-mentioned factors.This helps small businesses compete with Amazon and other large brands that have the fulfillment network capable of delivering orders quickly.Conclusion\nShipping costs not only depend on the product you’re sending and where you’re sending it from, but also on where and how fast the goods are being sent.Additionally, the total costs also depend on what carrier you are partnering up with.The good thing is that these things can often be estimated to great accuracy with the help of internet tools.To sum things up, shipping costs, while they seem simple enough, involve a lot of complex factors in their overall calculation, and you should definitely keep them in mind.Get started with ShipHero’s fulfillment services to reduce

ShipHero.Driven to create great products and the teams that build them, Nicholas Daniel-Richards has been responsible for developing a wide range of products, platforms, and teams across a variety of industries and organizations.He founded his first start up right out of college and several more since then including one that was acquired by Omnicom in 2004.Over the last 15 years, Nicholas’ focus has been largely on the technology and innovation side.He has led the technology and strategy efforts as CTO for several agencies and technology oprganizations, including Omnicom, Code & Theory, DigitasLBi and Pivotal Labs working with clients such as Mashable, TechCrunch, TheVerge, Vogue, BBC Worldwide, Accenture Digital, Nielsen and Suntrust Bank.His most recent role saw Nicholas leading the National Basketball Players Association as the Chief Digital Officer, overseeing several large digital transformation initiatives along with a revised CBA.Nicholas founded ShipHero with Aaron to bring this combination of technological, organisational and experience design expertise to help ecommerce businesses all over the world better manage their logistics and fulfillment.Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series!Before we dive in, our readers would love to learn a bit more about you.Can you tell us a story about what brought you to this specific career path?E\nllo Jiliea!My career path has been very random and had many ups and downs.Where I’ve been fortunate is being obsessed with solving problems with software.I met my Co-Founder, Aaron Rubin in the early 2000s after he stole a developer from one of my engineering teams!We quickly found that we both shared the same obsession with solving complicated problems.After a few bad ideas, we landed on ecommerce shipping as an opportunity to innovate.Aaron ran his own ecommerce business and had struggled with the logistics side, and I had led ecommerce builds for BBC Worldwide and Gant — it was a true ah-ha moment.We started building software in 2013, not sure if and when we would find customers.Just under two years later, we went live with our first customer.Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you started your career?Probably the most interesting experience in my career happened during my last full-time job before I made the decision to focus on ShipHero full time and we could afford to pay a salary.I was the chief digital officer for the NBPA.I had never played basketball, and at 6’2”, I wasn’t exactly the “average” basketball player height.However, I had the opportunity to build some amazing tech, engage directly with NBA players such as Seth Curry and Lebron James, and learn some valuable leadership lessons from Michele Roberts, the first woman to lead a sports union.I learned about basketball from the players perspective, the journey of young men and their parents from pre-draft to draft pick and beyond.The most notable moment was when I tutored NY Knicks Rookie Marshall Plumlee on how to write code.Fortunately we had a standup desk to work at — Marshall being 7’ tall and was passionate about technology.I left that job to embark on this ride with ShipHero, but I fondly remember that time as a privilege in my career.Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting?Can you tell us what lesson or takeaway you learned from that?So many mistakes ☺ Funniest?Crumbs.Ok here goes…For a couple of years I was doing sales.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+q9D/N9ByfjUhTtvHUbKZE5cq9JdQ5k6zwTJ6u/R9B8="},"8767e37e-1276-4eea-994e-3b1ccfb59b1c":{"id_":"8767e37e-1276-4eea-994e-3b1ccfb59b1c","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a6c63378-4662-4586-8a7b-5c8539f64e09","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"hash":"wfB9Bct43BzHufZIaJH4WIgRriehciZ2pfrA7QQwWWY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"be589cc6-9c24-40ae-8ad1-41ec23bc046d","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"hash":"+q9D/N9ByfjUhTtvHUbKZE5cq9JdQ5k6zwTJ6u/R9B8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"274dde1c-8c68-427c-8799-6358bbcd425a","metadata":{},"hash":"Asf9fYcqCQZC3x8/LGy90/8gY3jnyNulpyL27BNW+u8="}},"text":"However,

or takeaway you learned from that?So many mistakes ☺ Funniest?Crumbs.Ok here goes…For a couple of years I was doing sales.Basically, if someone was interested in what we could do, I would be the person they talk to.I’m not a sales professional by any means.However, sales is about listening: knowing if you can help, calling out when you can’t and making good conversation.One time, I had made a scheduling mistake where two separate business owners who were interested in a demo and Q&A session had been scheduled for the same video call.Much awkwardness followed.Fortunately, I had tea ready to drink to calm my nerves, and both business owners found it more entertaining than anything else.My takeaway?Use automation to solve simple tasks and save yourself time!I quickly found Calendly that very same day and haven’t had an issue since.Oh, and we also hired a sales professional ☺\nAre you working on any new exciting projects now?How do you think that might help people?Always!We launched our ShipHero Fulfillment last year to quickly create a network of warehouses across the US that ships orders for ecommerce brands that outsource their shipping.We were also very fortunate to be the launch partner for Shopify Fulfillment, which was an exhilarating experience.Right now, we’re focused on thinking beyond the warehouse.We’ve launched three of our own fulfillment centers that are matched up with our partner warehouses.We’re using this network to move our customers’ inventory across the network of warehouses, using data and machine learning to predict the best location for products.With a single aim to reduce the distance packages need to travel when shipped.We now have 2-day ground shipping coverage for over 98% of the contiguous US population.By doing this, we’ve eliminated shipping bottlenecks, delays and surcharges that the carriers are adding as they become more overwhelmed.It’s a complicated problem to solve, and it took us seven years to get here.Last month we shipped 3.9 million packages.We’re enabling high growth ecommerce brands to reduce their shipping costs, while improving shipping times and customer experience.Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not “burn out”?This is a tough one, as I do still suffer from burn out every now and then.The past six months have been breathtaking with regards to basically everything.That said, I’ve learned some basic things over the years.Number one thing for me — sleep.I aim for at least seven hours every night, and to make sure I do actually sleep, I do not bring my phone or any device into the bedroom!Also diet.I lost about 70lbs a few years ago by restricting sugar and carbs.Basically, I eat veggies and proteins.Every now and then I still have some cake or pizza!I do love my cake, and pizza is food of the gods as far as I’m concerned.Finally, I’ve come to the realization that I have to be a bit more forgiving of myself.Some days I start out with my to do list and before I know it, it’s 9pm and I didn’t hit one thing on that list given all the other things that happened in the day.I’m getting better and reducing that list, and accepting that there will be days where I won’t get done what I wanted to, that’s ok, that’s what the next day is for.None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way.Is there a particular person to whom you are grateful, who helped get you to where you are?Can you share a story?Wow, this is a great question.Honestly, there have been many people in my life, some I’ve known for years, others have been brief moments at different companies.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IiXYYlIjw/D4bFoQAkNMpDYgRoEN79PW+DXcmjEcwMk="},"274dde1c-8c68-427c-8799-6358bbcd425a":{"id_":"274dde1c-8c68-427c-8799-6358bbcd425a","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a6c63378-4662-4586-8a7b-5c8539f64e09","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"hash":"wfB9Bct43BzHufZIaJH4WIgRriehciZ2pfrA7QQwWWY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8767e37e-1276-4eea-994e-3b1ccfb59b1c","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"hash":"un+7PND+eJzS2KjtxIy0a8o/5aB1qH/4eTZo7/M2q08="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"94d4666f-679a-472b-9632-6e5a838b55a6","metadata":{},"hash":"fUHT+iKhX8jkhRW+Ta3oITK1BgPcJ+LCYP/0n4C/YKM="}},"text":"I

are grateful, who helped get you to where you are?Can you share a story?Wow, this is a great question.Honestly, there have been many people in my life, some I’ve known for years, others have been brief moments at different companies.You said one person, which is not fair, so I’ll focus on the most recent person in my life that’s both a mentor and someone I implicitly trust.That is my fellow founder, Aaron.This is not my first startup, though it is by far the most successful to date, and the reason for this I attribute to Aarons vision and his character.That’s not to say he doesn’t have flaws, or that we always get along.No, sometimes it’s really stressful and we do have different approaches and opinions on many things.That said, to know you can keep forging ahead, make mistakes, learn and do that in an environment where you can grow, I am grateful for that.I know it sounds cheesy, but, I really mean it.Without Aaron, we would not be where we are, and I know I’m doing my fair share too, I’m just grateful to have the chance to build a great team, culture and a business that’s having an impact.How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world?There are two things we actively do to try and bring more good than bad to the world:.#1 We work with select nonprofit businesses pro bono.They really appreciate having access to our services and it gives our team the chance to work with organizations they have a personal connection with.This type of work gives us purpose beyond building a great business.#2 We treat everyone with empathy and sincerity, and always a good dose of self deprecating British humor.Both internally and externally, it’s important to us to have this friendly rapport with our customers and partners.At our core, we strive to be authentic and truthful.I’ve learned that when you put good out there, it often comes back to you, and then we all benefit.Ok super.Now let’s jump to the main questions of our interview.The Pandemic has changed many aspects of all of our lives.One of them is the fact that so many of us have gotten used to shopping almost exclusively online.Can you share five examples of different ideas that large retail outlets are implementing to adapt to the new realities created by the Pandemic?Absolutely.Simply put, this has been a watershed moment for ecommerce.First and most obvious, large retail outlets have started using outsourced fulfillment providers (such as ShipHero!)to quickly pivot and provide DTC ecommerce shipping for customers who purchase at home.Established brands are setting up smaller innovation teams that think and behave more like startups.For companies that have their own logistics teams, we provide software that can be implemented in a few weeks designed to run the entire ecommerce fulfillment warehouse.From inventory management, pick pack & ship and automation.We’re seeing large companies move from typical enterprise software cycles of 6+ months to experiment and figure out how to pivot to ecommerce shipping using our SaaS product in a couple of weeks.We even have a few customers who ship themselves in addition to using our fulfillment service to manage volume and reduce shipping costs, one notable brand is Mars.Their team approached us and were shipping thousands of orders within five weeks after initial conversations.Another prime example is the transformation of retail locations into fulfillment centers.One of our most revered customers, Canadian Tire, quickly pivoted from a single ecommerce fulfillment center, and implemented our software in many of their retail locations.By doing this, they transformed their retail footprint into an intelligent and responsive network of fulfillment warehouses where orders are shipped from the closest warehouse to delivery addresses, as well as offering in-store and curb side pick-up.We’re seeing a surge in subscription box offerings, from paper consumables to footwear.Now that more of us are buying at home, we’re more open to simplifying when we need to purchase or receive replenishments of products, instead of getting in a car and doing the routine replenishment.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"i6QnsMUwzVe6zTHkNtxhmbtHZPmOisEBpTQJVP/7G3Q="},"94d4666f-679a-472b-9632-6e5a838b55a6":{"id_":"94d4666f-679a-472b-9632-6e5a838b55a6","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a6c63378-4662-4586-8a7b-5c8539f64e09","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"hash":"wfB9Bct43BzHufZIaJH4WIgRriehciZ2pfrA7QQwWWY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"274dde1c-8c68-427c-8799-6358bbcd425a","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"hash":"Asf9fYcqCQZC3x8/LGy90/8gY3jnyNulpyL27BNW+u8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"10889cf8-8a3a-4aeb-bb2e-7a73aca87f1d","metadata":{},"hash":"I5b5/pJa7oQnuUNDlPmONF0DG/Igy+oTrNlHImTeqaQ="}},"text":"We

a surge in subscription box offerings, from paper consumables to footwear.Now that more of us are buying at home, we’re more open to simplifying when we need to purchase or receive replenishments of products, instead of getting in a car and doing the routine replenishment.Returns are also seeing a huge increase.Of course, that’s going to naturally happen because of the increase in digital purchases.However, some very smart brands are making it easier to shop digitally, try the purchase, say clothing, and return what you don’t want.Nordstrom Trunk Club was an early player in this space.Now we’re seeing a number of established brands as well as high growth dtc brands offer this because software and outsourced fulfillment offerings like ShipHero eliminate the logistical complexities.In your opinion, will retail stores or malls continue to exist?How would you articulate the role of physical retail spaces at a time when online commerce platforms like Amazon Prime or Instacart can deliver the same day or the next day?They will, though their function will see radical change.The physical store will still be a place that we can experience and try products in person before committing.In fact, we’ve seen this happening already with brands like Warby Parker that started as purely ecommerce experiences that created physical in store experiences.The instore experience will be more Apple Store, Warby Parker — places where we can learn, try and maybe purchase later digitally.For malls, this means they will pivot to become more of an experience destination, where you could go for great food, entertainment and have fun — not necessarily to go do your shopping.Another trend we’re going to see grow is turning large department stores such as JC Penny, Sears and Macy’s into fulfillment centers.Amazon is already exploring this concept.It’s something we’re keeping our eyes on.The so-called “Retail Apocalypse” has been going on for about a decade.While many retailers are struggling, some retailers, like Lululemon, Kroger, and Costco are quite profitable.Can you share a few lessons that other retailers can learn from the success of profitable retailers?This is a huge topic that we’re not going to be able to cover in a couple of sentences.That said, here are some observations from what we’re seeing and also from my experiences as a consumer.A big lesson is learning how to bring customers back to the in store experience.As consumers, we can buy most things on our phone, and there are going to be certain things we will never buy retail again.That said, most of us enjoy the experience of discovery, trying new things, the social aspect of experiences with friends or loved ones.Retailers that focus on experiences are going to find opportunity — while also having a sophisticated ecommerce experience that supports the purchase before, during or after the in store experience.I love the REI experience.They have a mission to be good for our environment as well as be a place of discovery.I can go there and spend hours discovering and maybe spending too much.Another area of innovation is reducing the friction of the in-store experience.First we saw self checkout, now Amazon is taking that to the next level where you can simple grab what you want and leave — my guess is as consumers, we’re going to want shopping to either be an experience where we can learn and discover, or where it’s really easy to get what you want, do this fast and get out.Amazon is going to exert pressure on all of retail for the foreseeable future.New Direct-To-Consumer companies based in China are emerging that offer prices that are much cheaper than US and European brands.What would you advise to retail companies and e-commerce companies, for them to be successful in the face of such strong competition?Honestly, I’m in awe of emerging brands that nail the story and experience.There are new category players popping up all the time.Again, think Warby Parker or Burst, or ByteMe.The opportunity as I see it is not the race to the bottom, and what I mean by that is being the cheapest.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ULFmaDvCpai5iSTBUo0P371Z/ATRP7iH8XmOseMu3RU="},"10889cf8-8a3a-4aeb-bb2e-7a73aca87f1d":{"id_":"10889cf8-8a3a-4aeb-bb2e-7a73aca87f1d","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a6c63378-4662-4586-8a7b-5c8539f64e09","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"hash":"wfB9Bct43BzHufZIaJH4WIgRriehciZ2pfrA7QQwWWY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"94d4666f-679a-472b-9632-6e5a838b55a6","metadata":{"url":"https://medium.com/authority-magazine/nicholas-daniel-richards-of-shiphero-the-future-of-retail-in-the-post-pandemic-world-cc6d8db4d0aa"},"hash":"fUHT+iKhX8jkhRW+Ta3oITK1BgPcJ+LCYP/0n4C/YKM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b861b064-7ad3-46b5-9c12-c5727251fc5d","metadata":{},"hash":"w3a1wk8lPo+4CDs/47xQEDCsNk3q783Kfj22dA4T+uU="}},"text":"First

represents what the consumer stands for — that is what social causes do brands stand for, how are they minimizing carbon emissions or how are they helping communities be it local or around the world.Thank you for all of that.We are nearly done.Here is our final ‘meaty’ question.You are a person of great influence.If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be?You never know what your idea can trigger.:-)\nWow.Influence!?Do you have me confused with someone else?You don’t think I’m Damian Lewis do you?Oh, you mean ShipHero!Well, our influence is pushing it — maybe it’s more about taking a stand and fighting for it, and we’re amongst good company.Emerging brands and the established brands that can stay nimble, adapt at the speed of ecommerce and the consumer are going to thrive.Right now, we stand at a pivotal moment in history.We need to get serious about our impact on the environment, and as a company, as a founder, I know we have that opportunity to not only do good, we can also provide the platform for brands and the consumer to reduce or even eliminate carbon emissions when shipping ecommerce.We started with our network of warehouses, with the goal of eliminating the need for air cargo, and eventually reaching a point where we have ground transportation delivering customer orders through national, regional and local transportation networks.We are using recyclable packaging for boxes and packing materials thanks to our partnership with Ranpak.That said, we have a lot of work to be done, 7+ years in and it feels like we’re just getting started.We couldn’t do any of this without the trust and inspiration of both emerging brands and the disruptors transforming established brands alike.However, right now — let’s get through this holiday season!How can our readers further follow your work?We share thoughts on our blog, https://shiphero.com/blog as well our podcast where I have
