Although they offer similar rates and services, there may be advantages to using UPS vs USPS, or UPS vs FedEx. So how do you choose? The answer is in the details.\\nWe talked to Kevin Hernandez, a shipping and supply chain solutions consultant with years of experience in logistics and the supply chain industry, for insights on each major carrier to help you determine which company offers the best combination of rates, delivery speed, and services for your specific needs.\\n“Choosing between UPS, FedEx, and USPS depends on various factors, such as shipment destination, the weight, the size, the speed, and, ultimately, the budget of the client,” Hernandez says.\\nThe major carriers are all well-established, reliable, and have extensive networks. While UPS and FedEx are public companies, the USPS is an independent entity within the executive branch of the U.S. government. The USPS dominates in terms of volume with 32 percent of U.S. parcel shipments, followed by UPS with 24 percent and FedEx with 19 percent. Amazon Logistics and other smaller carriers account for the remaining 25 percent.\\nThe USPS is operated by the federal government as a low-cost service to both consumers and businesses. As such, it is required to deliver six days per week to every address and post office box in the U.S., and it is the only one of the major carriers to do so. It also treats deliveries to all U.S. territories, possessions, military bases, and diplomatic posts as domestic shipments. USPS is also the only carrier to offer Saturday delivery free of charge.\\nBy contrast, both UPS and FedEx are for-profit corporations that are primarily business oriented. They differentiate themselves with faster speed, more customizable delivery and specialized services designed for specific business needs. Both add a surcharge for residential and Saturday deliveries.\\nA look at the chart below reveals that the carriers and their offerings are comparable in many ways. But there are many factors that must be considered when choosing which carrier you should be working with.\\nCarrier comparison: UPS vs FedEx vs USPS\\n  UPS FedEx USPS\\nRates Competitive.\\nAnnual increases plus surcharges.\\nDiscounts available with UPS account created in PitneyShip® solutions\\nCompetitive.\\nAnnual increases plus surcharges.\\nDiscounts available with FedEx account.

There are many other factors to the equation, and this article will examine most of them. That said, although there are differences, the carriers’ base rates don’t tend to vary a great deal. In fact, UPS and FedEx prices usually track each other very closely, while USPS rates are generally lower because the postal service is not a for-profit enterprise.\\n“For example, USPS may be cheaper for a 10-pound box, while UPS and FedEx might be cheaper for a 30-pound box,” Hernandez explains. “Shippers should compare the rates and services offered by each carrier to determine the most cost-effective option for their shipment, which is what I always advise my clients to do. So just make sure that you look at everybody, because, again, USPS might be better for a 2-pound package, but UPS might be a lot better for a 20-pound package. So, it all kind of depends on what you’re shipping and where you’re shipping to.”\\nAt the time of publication, all three carriers’ flat rate and ground shipping rates start in the vicinity of $10. Overnight shipping costs start at more than double that amount. Rates go up as package size, weight and shipping distance increase. At the same time, the costs of surcharges and fees for value-added services have been rising faster than base rates. All in all, it’s more important than ever to know what your options are, so that you can control spending and optimize the customer experience.\\nBetween USPS, UPS and FedEx, which carrier is the best for the way you ship?\\nPrice and speed are always important considerations in selecting which shipping company to use. But there may be other factors that are equally important – and may even be more important – in your decision making. Do you prefer the simplicity of flat rate shipping? Do you need fast delivery for perishable items? Are you shipping small high-ticket items such as jewelry and designer watches? Do you need to ship hazardous materials?\\n“When choosing a shipping carrier, you should consider various factors, such as the rates, delivery, speed, reliability, and customer service,” Hernandez adds. “Those are very specific and important needs.”\\nFlat rate shipping\\nBoth FedEx and UPS provide savings, free packaging and a choice of delivery speed. By contrast, USPS offers low rates, and the 1-3 day delivery speed is satisfactory in many cases. Shippers can choose from a wide variety of packages – all of which are provided free of charge. Package pickup and tracking are also free, and there is no extra charge for Saturday delivery. However only FedEx offers Pak and tube options.\\nSmall, lightweight packages\\nIt’s very challenging for other carriers to compete with USPS, which offers a combination of low rates and speedy, six-day-per-week delivery to businesses and residences. Delivery by mail carrier keeps costs low. However, both FedEx and UPS offer considerable savings with flat-rate shipping, with your choice of delivery speed. They have also been very successful catering to businesses with early morning delivery of important documents via overnight envelope.\\nLarge packages\\nAlthough overnight envelopes and paks may be more common, all three carriers can and do accept large and even oversized packages for shipment. Until recently, the USPS never charged additional fees, but in 2022 they implemented new non-standard fees for packages that measure more than 14 inches in length or more than two cubic feet in volume.\\nFedEx and UPS both treat oversized packages in much the same way; the difference is in the details. Both apply special handling charges or oversize package surcharges but waive special handling fees when adding the oversize surcharge to your bill. Special handling fees range from roughly $20 to $30 per package; oversize surcharges tend to be much heftier, in excess of $100 per package. It's important to note that these additional charges go up during times of peak shipping demand, so it’s smart to shop rates during the holiday season. Good shipping software will let you see and compare these charges before you ship, instead of getting surprised by unexpected chargebacks to your account.\\nHeavy packages\\nWhen it comes to shipping heavier packages, each carrier has its own pros and cons. If you are shipping heavy packages weighing 70 lbs. or less, USPS offers low rates, but not the fastest delivery. FedEx and UPS both accept packages weighing up to 150 lbs. but the cost for getting them delivered overnight is high, and they both impose surcharges for overweight packages. However, if the items to be shipped can fit into either carrier’s free flat rate shipping packages, it’s possible to greatly reduce shipping costs without compromising delivery speed.\\nOvernight shipping\\nAll three carriers compete vigorously in the attempt to capture a larger share of the overnight shipping market. UPS and FedEx rates tend to be very similar. Both guarantee next-day delivery and will issue a refund for late deliveries not attributable to events beyond their control. By contrast, USPS rates tend to be lower but next day delivery is not always guaranteed. FedEx has the most overnight options for residential deliveries; FedEx Priority Overnight® shipments will arrive by noon, while FedEx Standard Overnight® shipments will arrive by 8:00 pm. UPS Next Day Air® Saver, the only UPS overnight option for residential deliveries, guarantees delivery by end of day. There are also some differences in geographic coverage. All three cover the entire Continental US, but only UPS includes Puerto Rico. Both FedEx and UPS focus their earliest next-day delivery services on cities and highly populated areas. If you are shipping to remote areas in the lower 48, Priority Mail Express becomes more competitive.\\nHigh-value shipping\\nUPS offers optional coverage for declared values up to $50,000 per package, or an enhanced option of up to $70,000 for certain domestic packages subject to specific terms and conditions. FedEx Declared Value Advantage program allows frequent shippers of jewelry, gemstones or precious metals to declare a value up to $100,000 per shipment. The program is not applicable to one-time or occasional shipments, and prior qualification is required for participation.\\nShipping hazardous materials\\nThe USPS allows you to ship many common hazardous materials such as fragrances, hand sanitizer or lithium batteries provided that they are properly packaged and labeled. They’ll even pick your shipment up free of charge. Both UPS and FedEx require that you open an account to ship hazardous materials. In addition, FedEx requires advance approval, and only accepts hazardous material shipments at certain FedEx locations. Both companies impose a dangerous goods surcharge for air shipments.\\nWhich shipping carrier has the best discounts?\\nDiscount programs are available from every major carrier, so no business that ships parcels on a regular basis should be paying retail rates. Shipping discounts are an important way to reduce costs, and they’re easy to obtain, even if you aren’t currently a high-volume shipper. Discounts may be the factor that determines, for example, whether UPS or FedEx is the cheaper option. So, it makes good sense for shippers to take advantage of every available discount.\\n“It ultimately depends on the volume of shipments,” Hernandez notes. “When it comes to big shippers, they have a lot of power, and I don't think a lot of them understand that. Because clients who are spending millions of dollars with UPS or FedEx could move that volume to their competitor, and that could really hurt UPS or FedEx in the long run.”\\nUSPS discounts are not available at the Post Office. There are two ways to access discounted rates:\\nClick-N-Ship and Click-N-Ship Business Pro allow small home-based businesses to print Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express labels and earn credits that can be applied toward future purchases through the USPS Loyalty Program.\\nShipping software such as PitneyShip Pro provides access to best in market USPS rates when sending parcels and mail along with other benefits like waived surcharges. And there are no minimum volume requirements.\\n  UPS discounts are significant for account holders.\\nUp to 50%* on every UPS® shipment with an account\\nPersonalized discounts based on shipping needs and volume (includes discounts on surcharges)\\n  Thanks to a long-standing relationship between UPS and Pitney Bowes, PitneyShip Pro users enjoy even deeper discounts along with additional benefits like waived peak and fuel surcharges, discounted pick up fees, and more. And there are no minimum volume requirements.\\nFedEx offers discounts based on your monthly shipping volume when you open a free business account, or through shipping software. Potential savings include:\\n30% on FedEx Express® U.S., domestic, international and returns services\\n15% on FedEx Ground® shipping and FedEx Home Delivery® services, including returns service\\n70% on FedEx Freight® less-than-truckload services\\n10% on FedEx Office® print and copy services\\nWhich shipping carrier is the fastest?\\nToday, all of the major carriers offer fast delivery throughout the contiguous 48 states. UPS and FedEx are often faster than USPS, because they offer overnight delivery and even same day service in certain densely populated areas. However, although both provide overnight delivery, one or the other may be the fastest to certain Alaska, Hawaii or remote destinations within the Continental U.S. The best way to find the fastest shipping method for critical deliveries is using multi-carrier shipping software like PitneyShip® and PitneyShip® Pro.\\nSpeed comparison of FedEx vs UPS overnight delivery\\nDestination UPS Fedex\\nAnchorage, Ak 8:30 am 11:00 am\\nHonolulu, HI 11:00 pm noon\\nPlentywood, MT 11:00 pm 4:30 pm\\nEureka, NV 2:00 pm 4:40 pm\\n“Delivery times can vary depending on the carrier, origin, and destination,” Hernandez says. “I’ve had clients ship product from New York to New Jersey, and they’ve had it there the next day, while others have taken multiple days. So, delivery times can vary based on a lot of factors such as weather conditions and package value.”\\nWhich shipping carrier is best for weekend shipments?\\nAll three carriers offer Saturday delivery as an option. Deciding which is the best choice depends on what is most important to you: the earliest possible delivery or not having to pay an additional fee. Only USPS delivers to all US businesses and residences on Saturday at no extra charge. The mail carrier will also pick up your outgoing packages on Saturday. And because the USPS processes mail every day of the week, your package will be on its way without delay.\\nBoth FedEx and UPS provide Saturday delivery, but it may not be available with every shipping option, and you’ll have to pay an extra fee. FedEx First Overnight® and UPS Next Day Air ® Early provide Saturday delivery to businesses only.\\n  Saturday delivery Saturday pickup\\nUPS shipping options\\nUPS Next Day Air® Early YES in select locations YES in select locations\\nUPS Next Day Air® YES in select locations YES in select locations\\nUPS Next Day Air® Saver NO NO\\nUPS 2nd Day Air AM NO NO\\n  UPS 2nd Day Air YES YES\\nUPS 3 Day Select YES in select locations YES in select locations\\nUPS Ground YES in select locations YES in select locations\\nFedEx shipping options    \\nFedEx First Overnight® YES, in some areas NO\\nFedEx Priority Overnight® YES, in some areas YES\\nFedEx Standard Overnight® NO YES.\\nFree Saturday hold at location\\nFedEx 2Day AM NO YES\\nFedEx 2Day YES NO\\nFedEx Express Saver NO YES\\n    Which carrier offers the best selection of value-added services?\\nAll three carriers offer a broad selection of optional, value-added services that allow you to customize delivery to your specific business needs. Some customization options are also available to recipients, such as the ability to schedule a specific delivery time or re-route a package to a different address.\\nComparison of value-added services\\n  UPS FedEx USPS\\nCollect on Delivery\\n(C.O.D.)

All three carriers offer the choice of either a one-time pickup or recurring pickups. Both FedEx and UPS have flexible options for recurring pickups; both require an account.\\nUSPS offers two pickup options for packages with prepaid postage affixed. With a package pickup service, you can simply hand outgoing packages to the mail carrier. It’s free as long as the pickup is part of the mail carrier’s regular route. There’s only a charge if a special trip is required. Pickup On Demand, which is available in most Zip codes, lets you schedule pickups for time-sensitive shipments online for a fee.\\nFedEx requires that one-time pickups must be scheduled online. Account holders can set up recurring pickups (daily or at regular intervals) online or by contacting customer service. A fee applies to all pickups except regularly scheduled Express pickups.\\nYou can schedule a one-time UPS pickup online or by calling an 800 number. To save delivery fees, you can hand outgoing packages to the UPS driver while they are making a delivery to you. Setting up recurring deliveries requires a UPS.com payment account. Choices include daily, automatic or day-specific pickups., Plus, you can save even more with free or discounted package pickups when using a shipping software solution from Pitney Bowes.\\nHow do shipping and handling fees differ among the different carriers?\\nShipping and handling fees are determined by the shipper, not the carrier. Shipping fees are only one component of this cost, which also includes all expenses related to fulfilling an order such as packaging, labor and overhead. See this article on shipping and handling for a full explanation.\\nOn the other hand, carriers will charge special handling fees for packages that are oversized, overweight, oddly shaped or otherwise difficult to handle. Because these fees can be very costly, it may make sense to ship these items as freight.\\nWhat different shipping insurance options exist with USPS, UPS and FedEx?\\nUPS, FedEx and the USPS all offer shipping insurance coverage for up to $100 in declared value free of charge. Declared value is the carrier’s maximum liability in connection with the shipment of a package, including any loss, damage, delay, or mis-delivery. Shippers can purchase additional coverage for packages worth more than that amount.\\n  Comparison of insurance options by carrier\\n  UPS FedEx USPS\\nDeclared value up to $100 Free Free Free with Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express\\nDeclared value over $100 1.15% of value 1.25% value Percentage varies\\nMaximum coverage\\n(per package) Up to $50,000 (or $70,000 subject to terms) Up to $100,000 for precious metals, gems and jewelry through Up to $5,000\\n    Declared Value Advantage service  \\n  How to make smart shipping decisions every time\\nIt’s clear that no single carrier will always be the best choice for every shipment. But how can you know which carrier and shipping option to choose for any individual package? The complexity of various rates, weights, dimensions, distance and delivery speeds makes calculations very difficult, if not impossible to carry out quickly and accurately. Plus, the best choice may be counterintuitive; for example, when ground shipping is the cheapest option for overnight delivery to nearby zones. Not to mention, carrier shipping rates are constantly changing and rates are subject to change at any time.\\n“UPS, FedEx, and USPS are all reliable, efficient shipping carriers,” Hernandez concludes. “There may be some instances where one might be better than the other, but it all depends on the client and what their shipping needs are.”\\nThat’s why savvy shippers rely on shipping software from Pitney Bowes to simplify the shipping process and ensure that they get the best deal for each package they send.\\nPitneyShip® for the home or office worker shipping from one location\\nAccess discount shipping labels and stamps\\nRate shop across USPS, UPS, and FedEx with our best match tool\\nBuy and print postage from your computer\\nSchedule pickups and track packages\\n  PitneyShip® Pro for organizations with multiple shippers and/or across locations\\nCompare shipping carrier rates across USPS, UPS, and FedEx with our best match tool\\nSave with deeply discounted rates\\nCreate Certified Mail with electronic return receipt\\nPrint shipping labels and postage from your computer\\nEasily scale as needed with multi-user and multi-location access\\nBoost productivity with secure single sign on access\\nSchedule pickups and track packages\\n  Visit us online to discover the many ways you can ship smarter with PitneyShip® and PitneyShip® Pro shipping software.\\nStart saving on shipping rates today\\nCurrent Article Tags\\ncarriers multi-carrier shipping office View more\\nRelated Content\\nShipping discounts available from UPS, USPS and FedEx\\n15m read 06/19/2023 Office\\nSave big with discounts on UPS shipping rates through PitneyShip®\\n15m read 01/19/2023 Office\\nWhat you need to know about shipping insurance for eCommerce\\n15m read 01/23/2023 Office\\nShipping and handling: The ultimate guide\\n15m read 01/13/2023 Office\\nInterested in our shipping software?\\nLearn more\\nAbout Pitney Bowes\\nOur Company\\nNewsroom\\nContact Us\\nInvestor Relations\\nCorporate Responsibility\\nCareers\\nSupplier Information\\nShop\\nInk & Supplies by Meter\\nMailing Supplies\\nOrder History\\nReturns\\nYour Account\\nView & Pay Bills\\nView Order History\\nValueMAX\\nYour Account Support\\nRewards\\nSign in to your account\\nProduct Support\\nPostal Rate Change\\nEnvelope Messaging\\nProduct Support\\nConnectivity Support\\nPartner Program\\nPartner Locator\\nShipping API Program\\nServices\\nService Offerings\\nProfessional Services\\nFollow Us\\nFacebook\\nLinked In\\nTwitter\\nYouTube\\nInstagram\\n©1996-2024 Pitney Bowes Inc.

Customised shipping options and fuss-free returns policies are also appreciated, but the study highlights that regional satisfaction with returns is low.\\nNow in its seventh year, the UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper™ studysheds light on consumer online shopping behaviour. It also, for the first time, features insights into the buying habits of business purchasers. Conducted in Australia, China, Hong Kong and South Korea, as well as 11 other markets across the Americas, Europe and India, the study tracks evolving trends and demands from e-commerce customers.\\nNarrowing in on the moments that matter in the purchase journey, the research unearths valuable insights for businesses looking to grow their customer base in Asia Pacific. The findings reveal three overarching factors that impact consumers’ purchasing decisions – visibility across the purchase journey, incentives offered, and ways in which shoppers can customise their purchase and delivery experience.\\n“Consumers in Asia Pacific are increasingly knowledgeable about the options available to them when shopping online, and this is driving a demand for complete clarity and access to information throughout the purchase journey, as well as greater flexibility in both the shopping and shipping process,” said Sylvie Van den Kerkhof, Vice President of Marketing, UPS Asia Pacific.\\n“As consumers are presented with more options to buy online and competition increases, expectations are becoming more refined and retailers need to be agile enough to stay ahead of the trends. The ability to offer incentives not just in the form of a unique product offering but also in the shipping and delivery experience will be crucial to success in the evolving e-commerce landscape.”\\n\\\"The value of the Thai e-commerce industry is expected to grow from US$3 billion in 2018 to US$13 billion by 20251. A large portion of this is driven by cross-border e-commerce and high demand for Thai products,” said Russell Reed, Managing Director of UPS Thailand and Vietnam.\\n“The Asia Pacific edition of the UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper™ study helps retailers in Thailand tap into this rapid growth by providing more in-depth analysis of customer purchasing behaviours across the region. The patterns and trends revealed by the study can then be leveraged to ensure that overseas customers are receiving the service they expect, in turn maximising customer loyalty and the potential for repeat business.”\\nShoppers want answers before they commit\\nA significant 90% of all consumers globally research their product before proceeding with a purchase. While price is the most commonly researched information worldwide, by comparison it is less important for consumers in Asia Pacific (74%), than for those in the Americas and Europe (both 81%).\\nReviewing a retailer’s returns policy is often part of the pre-purchase process, with 42% of online shoppers in Asia Pacific doing this before making a transaction, reinforcing why it is important that retailers make this information clear and easy to find.\\nFurthermore, the findings identify that shoppers may cancel a purchase when they find out the retailer is based internationally, if they were unaware of this initially. 77% of shoppers in China have done this, as well as 65% in Australia, and 60% in Hong Kong and South Korea. At the same time, 75% of all shoppers in Asia Pacific have knowingly made purchases from international sellers, suggesting that online shopping is situational and, with international purchases likely taking longer to arrive, how long a customer is willing to wait may depend on what they are buying.\\nShipping incentives and customer service drive repeat business\\nContinuing the trend from previous years’ studies, consumers still value free shipping, as highlighted by the fact that high delivery cost is the most common reason for an abandoned shopping cart. Asia Pacific shoppers will often take actions to reduce shipping costs, with 37% indicating that they are willing to add items to their cart to qualify for free shipping, and 27% saying they would purchase an alternative product priced above the retailer’s free-shipping threshold. These figures indicate that shoppers can actually be incentivised to spend more on the actual purchase, if this action will reduce the cost of shipping.\\nIn addition to being a key part of the pre-purchase routine, a good returns policy can also encourage customer loyalty. And with just 5% of Asia Pacific shoppers saying they are “very satisfied” with the returns process, there is huge potential for retailers with a good returns policy to rise above the competition. The common causes of dissatisfaction with the returns experience were a delay in receiving refunds (cited by an average of 32% of respondents across the region), having to pay for their own returns (31%) and delays in receiving a replacement product (25%).\\nFurthermore, shoppers have been empowered to “vote with their clicks” when they have bad experiences with a merchant. In Asia Pacific, 93% of consumers who receive poor customer service will either stop using that merchant or reduce how often they purchase from them. This is most apparent with South Korean shoppers; 70% of whom will stop buying from a merchant altogether due to bad customer service.\\nI want it my way\\nThe popularity of alternative delivery locations in Asia Pacific is a continuing trend, with the study finding that only 36% of the region’s consumers prioritise receiving their package in-person at their home – compared to 62% in Europe – while 19% are happy to have the package left on their doorstep or porch.\\nConsumers in Asia Pacific are also more likely to know about and make use of specialised delivery services, such as UPS My Choice®. The ability to select shipping options offers added convenience, with the research revealing that the ability to choose a delivery day has the greatest appeal.\\nAs an alternative to purchasing directly from a retailer, marketplaces are also a popular purchasing platform, with 93% of Asia Pacific shoppers having purchased from a marketplace in the three months prior to the survey. The region has notable market-level variations when it comes to the marketplace that businesses should take into account and cater to – 100% of respondents in China had made a purchase from one of these platforms in the three months leading up to the survey, whereas 14% in Australia and 10% in Hong Kong don’t use marketplaces at all, the highest rates of non-usage in the world.\\nBusiness purchasers think like consumers\\nExpanding the study to cover B2B purchasing this year, the findings show that business buyers follow many of the same trends as consumers.\\nSimilar to the consumer shopper, 96% of Asia Pacific buyers consider the ability to track packages important, with the preferred method of tracking deliveries being a carrier’s website. 92% of business purchasers would like to see all elements of their delivery managed by the supplier or shipper, and this is particularly so in Hong Kong, where respondents unanimously chose this option.\\nOne area where the responses differed however was that while 42% of B2C buyers will check the returns policy before making a purchase, this number jumps to 71% when it comes to business purchasers, even when the buyer already has a contract with the supplier.\\nFurthermore, business purchasers in Asia Pacific are more likely than the global average to purchase products from non-domestic marketplaces, with 71% purchasing internationally, the highest percentage of all regions surveyed. Of those that purchase internationally, 42% stated that they did so because of higher product quality, while 41% said it was because the product they wanted could only be bought from international suppliers.\\nOne area of commonality among business purchasers globally is the importance of knowing the fully-landed cost, or the total price of a product once it arrives at their location. Asia Pacific confirms this trend with 94% of buyers in the region indicating that this is important to them.\\n“For both consumers and business purchasers, the 2019 UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper reveals that here in Asia Pacific, we are navigating a world of choice and we expect to make purchases on our terms,” added Van den Kerkhof. \\n“In a crowded space like e-commerce, the kind of insight revealed by the Pulse of the Online Shopper study can make all the difference in helping businesses stay one step ahead – today, tomorrow, and next year.”\\n1. https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1703148/thai-e-commerce-to-hit-13bn-by-2025\\nAbout the UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper™\\nThe UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper™ global study evaluates consumer shopping habits and preferences from pre-purchase to post-delivery.

But, there are four key pieces of information that you’ll need every time. You should be able to receive an accurate price if you have this information. \\nHere are the four factors that may impact your shipping rates every time:\\nPoints of Origin and Destination for Shipping\\nThe distance traveled by a package from its point of origin to its shipping destination is an important element in determining the cost. In general, the greater the price, the more away you are. Shipping zones are used by couriers to properly calculate the distance a cargo travels from its origin to its final destination. There are now eight shipping zones in the United States, divided by zip code.\\nAlthough it’s a basic concept, you must first decide the location you are shipping from and the destination to which goods will be delivered before you can begin calculating prices.\\nGross Weight of the Package\\nThe deadweight of a package refers to its weight. Put it on a scale and find out how much it weighs. The more expensive it is to send a package, the heavier it is. But there’s also dimensional weight to consider. This becomes more intricate and is determined by the dimensions of the box in which you are shipping the products.\\nDimensions of the Package\\nThe length, breadth, and height of the packaging used to ship the products are the dimensions. Because packages arrive in a variety of sizes, it’s critical for eCommerce retailers to understand how this affects the price. Particularly when couriers charge by dimensional (or volumetric) weight as well. In a nutshell, this is the amount of room a product takes up in the delivery truck.\\nTo calculate the dimensional weight, couriers multiply the length, width, and height of your box, then divide the result by a cubic divisor of their choosing.\\nIt’s a good idea to understand more about dimensional weight and how to save shipping expenses by optimizing your packaging. These modest measures will help you save money on shipping and receive a more accurate quotation for eCommerce businesses\\nShipping Delivery Times\\nDelivery time refers to the time it takes for a product or cargo to arrive at its destination. Depending on the distance the cargo is travelling, this can range from overnight to over a month, & prices might vary accordingly.\\nIt will cost substantially more to get a parcel sent overnight than if you go for a typical 3-7 days delivery period. Before you settle on a shipping cost estimate, you’ll need to determine how quickly you want your products delivered.\\nValue of Products \\nIf you’re delivering high-value items, you should consider having your shipments insured. Senders who have their packages lost, stolen, or damaged in transit can get reimbursed with shipping insurance. This service, while handy, can dramatically increase your delivery costs.\\nTop 6 Factors Influencing Your Shipping Costs in 2024\\nBecause of the many extra taxes dependent on the destination country, the size and weight of the shipment, and the duration of delivery, international shipping can get complicated.\\nIt’s critical to do thorough research and properly calculate shipping costs so that your consumers aren’t surprised by exorbitant charges, which is one of the leading causes of shopping cart abandonment in eCommerce.\\nInsurance for Shipments\\nIf you’re shipping costly items, consider obtaining shipping insurance to safeguard against items being lost, stolen, or damaged during transit. The majority of shipments arrive safely, but mistakes can happen, and if you’re delivering high-value items, replacing inventory will cut into your earnings, so it’s important to be insured.\\nCouriers normally charge a little fee for this service – around 3% of the reported value of your package on average. Another option is to get shipping insurance from a third-party provider, which is usually less expensive. Through the Insurance Settings section of their dashboard, Easyship users can quickly add insurance to their shipments.\\nCost of Fuel\\nWhen fuel prices, particularly diesel, are greater in a certain location owing to taxes, market pressures, or other geographical variables, shipping charges rise. When fuel prices fall, shipping costs should fall as well. Carriers may raise their charges to protect themselves from abrupt fuel price spikes if fuel costs are variable at the time you’re shipping.\\nKeep in mind that shipping across states is typically more expensive owing to gasoline prices. Fuel prices in each state vary widely depending on local and state taxes. The cost of fuel in your location may differ from the cost of fuel in the shipment area. Fuel surcharge calculators are used by some truckers to estimate these fees, which are usually added to shipping rates.\\nMinimum Costs for Carriers\\nMinimum tariffs apply to all carriers. Regardless of how tiny your package is, if it falls below that level, you will be charged the minimum. Before hiring a shipper or looking into alternative shipping options like FedEx and UPS, you should make sure you have a package that is larger than the bare requirement.\\nExtra Charges\\nIf your package necessitates lift gates, inside delivery, residential delivery, or other access difficulties for drivers, factor them into your freight shipping prices. Dock-to-dock transportation is a specialty of commercial shipping. If you deviate from that, you will be charged for the inconvenience. Accessorial fees might range from delivery to a strip mall to appointments scheduled in advance. Make sure you’re aware of all of the alternatives ahead of time and that you consider them in the price of each task.\\nRelated Article: Ways to reduce transportation costs\\nCharges for Handling Dangerous Goods\\nDue to the contents of the package, packing, weight, and dimensions, you may be charged extra costs.\\nChemicals, needles, weapons, and, most significantly, lithium-ion batteries for eCommerce businesses are examples of risky goods that a courier feels are dangerous to handle. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) defines dangerous products worldwide, therefore that’s the best place to look for an official list.\\nIf the parcel exceeds the standard dimension or weight, is constructed of a substance such as wood or metal, or is cylindrical, an extra cost may be charged. It’s a good idea to double-check these costs before buying any boxes or containers.\\nTaxes and Duties\\nBefore your cargo is delivered to another nation, you or the recipient of your product may be requested to pay extra customs and taxes. Duties and taxes may be charged depending on what you’re shipping and how much it costs. These can be complicated and differ from nation to country. You should be aware of two sorts of responsibilities since they are frequently the source of hidden expenses.\\nDDU Shipments (Delivery Duty Unpaid): The recipient is responsible for paying the duty in order for the package to be released from customs. If the recipient refuses to pay the taxes or refuses to accept the delivery, you, as the sender, are still accountable. This is why, as a trader, it’s ideal to keep your overseas shipping charges as transparent as possible. It helps you save money.\\nDDP Shipments (Delivery Duty Paid): The sender is responsible for paying the levy, however, the computation is more complicated. When the shipment reaches the destination country, couriers will charge a “DDP handling fee” for paying the taxes and customs on your behalf. The proportion of taxes and tariffs is used to compute a “disbursement charge.” Yes, it’s complicated, but at the very least, you’ll know that the box won’t be returned because the receiver doesn’t pay or declines it.\\nWhen the cargo reaches the target country, the couriers will charge you an extra cost for paying the Taxes & Duties on your behalf. Aside from the predetermined DDP handling charge for managing certain taxes and levies, one can expect a disbursement fee.\\nUnder-declaring items on a commercial invoice might result in extra charges and lengthy delivery delays. If the customs clearing agency feels the claimed value is less than the market value, a fresh invoice is frequently requested, which might result in additional costs. There may be additional warehousing fees for keeping the product if it is not received within the desired time range. In addition, if you under-declare the contents of the box, the courier may charge you. As a result, this is an area where you must exercise extreme caution and pay close attention to the smallest of details.\\nImportance of Calculating/ Estimating Shipping Costs Accurately\\nThere are a lot of businesses out there that don’t take the time to calculate shipping costs accurately. This can lead to many problems down the road, including lost customers and increased expenses. Here are just a few reasons why it’s important to make sure you calculate your shipping costs accurately:\\nYou Could Lose Money on Each Shipment\\nIf you’re not careful, you could easily lose money on each shipment you send out. You could either be charging your customers too much for shipping or not enough. In both cases, you’re leaving money on the table that could be used to improve your business in other ways.\\nYour Customers Could Get Frustrated\\nIf your customers are constantly overcharged with shipping prices, they could get frustrated. This could lead to them taking their business elsewhere, which is the last thing you would want. Make sure you’re fair with your shipping charges, so your customers will stick around.\\nYou Could Run Into Cash Flow Problems\\nIf you’re not charging enough for shipping, it could eventually lead to cash flow problems. You’ll be spending more money on shipping than bringing in money from customer orders. Make sure you calculate shipping costs accurately so you don’t run into any financial difficulties down the road.\\nIt Could Affect Your Bottom Line\\nYour shipping charges will have a direct impact on your bottom line. If you’re not careful, you could spend more money on shipping than you’re making in profits. Make sure you’re doing everything you can to keep your shipping charges under control, so your business can be successful.\\nIt Could Hurt Your Reputation\\nIf customers consistently have problems with your shipping charges, it could hurt your reputation. Hence, it’s important to make sure you calculate shipping costs accurately. By providing fair and reasonable shipping charges, you’ll be able to keep your customers happy and maintain a good reputation for your business.\\nAs you can see, there are many reasons why it’s essential to estimate courier charges. If you’re not careful, it could lead to many problems for your business. Make sure you take the time to calculate shipping costs to avoid these potential problems.\\nHow Do Major Shipping US Courier Models Calculate Shipping Costs Instantly?\\nThe three big shipping services have their own cost calculators.\\nMany of the above elements are taken into account by each delivery provider in order to provide varied shipping price models and shipment methods.\\nHere are the price models and calculators for three of the most popular shipping companies in the United States: USPS, FedEx, and UPS.\\nUnited States Postal Service- Shipping Prices and Calculator \\nSource\\nThe United States Postal Service is frequently the cheapest of the three carriers, particularly for ground shipment.

According to a report by the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, inefficient inventory management can lead to significant losses, with companies potentially losing up to 20% of their revenue due to stockouts and excess inventory. This highlights the importance of having a robust system in place to manage stock levels effectively.  One such method that has gained traction in the logistics industry is ABC inventory analysis. This technique categorises inventory items based on their importance to the business, allowing organisations to prioritise their resources and optimise stock management. In this guide, we will delve into ABC analysis in inventory management, exploring its benefits, implementation strategies, and practical examples. By the end, you will understand how this powerful tool can enhance your inventory control processes and drive profitability. What Is ABC Analysis in Inventory Management? ABC analysis is a method used in inventory management that classifies items into three categories—A, B, and C—based on their significance to the overall business operations. This classification helps businesses focus their attention on high-value items while streamlining processes for lower-value items. The classification typically follows the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule), which suggests that a small percentage of items (20%) accounts for a large portion (80%) of the total value. Category A: Comprises the most valuable items, often representing 10-20% of total inventory but contributing 70-80% of the overall value. Category B: Includes moderate-value items that account for about 15-25% of total inventory value. Category C: This category consists of low-value items that make up 50-60% of the inventory but contribute only 5-10% to the total value. This systematic approach allows businesses to allocate resources more effectively and maintain optimal stock levels. How Is ABC Analysis Useful in Inventory Management? Implementing ABC analysis in inventory control can yield several advantages: Prioritisation of Resources: By identifying which items are most critical to business success, companies can focus their efforts on managing these high-value stocks more closely. Cost Reduction: Efficiently managing A items reduces carrying costs and minimises waste associated with overstocking or stockouts. Improved Customer Satisfaction: Ensuring that high-demand items are consistently available helps meet customer expectations and enhance service levels. Enhanced Decision-Making: With clear insights into item importance, businesses can make informed decisions regarding purchasing and stocking strategies. The ABC Classification System: Understanding Inventory Categories The ABC classification system is a fundamental component of ABC inventory analysis, designed to optimize inventory management by categorising items based on their importance to the business. This method allows organizations to focus their resources and attention on the most critical inventory items, ensuring efficient stock control and improved operational effectiveness. Categories Explained: In the ABC classification system, inventory items are divided into three distinct categories—A, B, and C—each reflecting the item's contribution to overall inventory value and its significance in the supply chain. Understanding these categories is essential for effective inventory management. CategoryDescriptionPercentage of ItemsPercentage of ValueAHigh-value items requiring tight control10-20%70-80%BModerate-value items with moderate control30%15-25%CLow-value items needing minimal control50-60%5-10% 1. Category A: The High-Value Items Items classified as Category A are typically the most valuable to a business, representing a small percentage of total inventory but contributing significantly to overall revenue. These items often require meticulous management due to their high cost and demand variability. Companies should prioritise these items for frequent review and monitoring, ensuring that they are adequately stocked to meet customer demand without incurring excess carrying costs. 2. Category B: The Moderate-Value Items Category B items are of moderate value and represent a larger portion of the inventory compared to A items. While they do not require as much attention as A items, they still play a crucial role in the overall inventory strategy. Businesses should implement regular checks on these items to ensure they are replenished appropriately, balancing between availability and cost efficiency. 3. Category C: The Low-Value Items Category C encompasses low-value items that comprise the majority of the inventory but contribute minimally to total revenue. While these items require less stringent control, businesses should still monitor them periodically to prevent stockouts or overstock situations. Efficient management of Category C items can free up resources and allow organisations to focus more on higher-value categories. Accurate classification within the ABC system is vital for effective inventory management. Misclassification can lead to inefficient resource allocation, increased carrying costs, and missed sales opportunities. Therefore, businesses must regularly review their classifications based on updated sales data and market trends to ensure that their inventory strategies remain aligned with current demands. How to Calculate ABC Inventory Analysis? Calculating ABC inventory analysis involves determining the annual consumption value for each item using the following formula: Annual Usage Value = Annual Units Sold × Cost per Unit Steps to Calculate: Data Collection: Gather data on each item's sales history and cost. Ranking: Rank all items based on their calculated annual usage value from highest to lowest. Categorisation: Divide the ranked list into A, B, and C categories based on predetermined thresholds. This systematic approach ensures that businesses can accurately classify their inventory according to its importance. Benefits of ABC Analysis in Inventory Management Implementing ABC analysis offers numerous advantages: Cost Reduction: By focusing on high-value A items, businesses can significantly reduce carrying costs associated with overstocking less critical items. This leads to improved cash flow and reduced waste. Improved Control and Efficiency: ABC analysis allows companies to implement tighter controls over high-value items while simplifying processes for lower-value stocks. This results in better resource allocation and streamlined operations. Better Decision-Making: With clear visibility into item importance, businesses can make informed decisions about which products to prioritise when ordering or restocking. This strategic approach minimises stockouts and enhances overall operational efficiency. Increased Customer Satisfaction: By ensuring that critical A category items are always available, businesses can meet customer demand more effectively, leading to enhanced satisfaction and loyalty. Implementing ABC Analysis in Your Business Steps to Implement ABC Analysis To successfully implement ABC analysis in your organisation, follow these key steps: Identify and List Inventory Items: Compile a comprehensive list of all inventory items along with their sales history and costs. Calculate Annual Usage Values: Use the formula provided earlier to determine each item's annual usage value. Rank Items: Rank all items based on their usage values from highest to lowest. Categorise Items: Assign each item to its respective category (A, B, or C) based on its ranking. Regularly reviewing these classifications ensures that they remain relevant as market conditions change. Example of ABC Analysis in Inventory Management To illustrate how ABC analysis works in practice, consider a fictional company, \\\"Sam's Fasteners.\\\" Example Calculation: Item A1: Sold 1,000 units at $10 each → Annual Usage Value = 1000 × 10 = 10,000 Item B1: Sold 500 units at $5 each → Annual Usage Value = 500 × 5 = 2,500 Item C1: Sold 200 units at $1 each → Annual Usage Value = 200 × 1 = 200 After calculating usage values for all items: Item A1 is classified as Category A. Item B1 is classified as Category B. Item C1 is classified as Category C. This example demonstrates how categorising inventory helps Sam's Fasteners focus its resources on managing high-value items effectively while simplifying processes for lower-value stocks. Challenges and Limitations of ABC Inventory Analysis While ABC analysis offers substantial benefits, it also presents challenges: Data Accuracy: Accurate data collection is crucial for effective classification; outdated or incorrect data can lead to misclassification. Dynamic Market Conditions: Changes in market demand may necessitate frequent re-evaluation of item classifications. Resource Intensive: Implementing an effective ABC analysis system may require significant time and resources initially.

To stay profitable and keep customers happy, it's essential to understand Seller-Controlled Return Rate (SCRR) and how it impacts your business. SCRR is a key metric that measures returns that are directly attributed to the seller's actions or issues, such as product defects, incorrect listings, or inadequate packaging. Managing SCRR effectively is crucial to maintaining strong seller performance metrics and eligibility for programs like Amazon Prime or Buy Box placement. What Is SCRR? (Seller-Controlled Return Rate) SCRR, or Seller-Controlled Return Rate, refers to returns that are caused by factors within the seller's control. This includes issues like inaccurate product descriptions, defective products, poor packaging, incorrect items being shipped, or expired goods. A high SCRR can negatively impact your seller performance, leading to account warnings, suspension, or disqualification from programs like Amazon Prime. Reasons for SCRR Classification ReasonDescriptionExampleInaccurate Product DescriptionThe product listing contains incorrect or misleading information, such as wrong dimensions, features, or materials.A seller lists a product as \\\"100% cotton,\\\" but it actually contains synthetic fibers.Defective or Damaged ProductsItems that are shipped in poor condition or are non-functional upon arrival.An electronic gadget is shipped but doesn’t turn on due to a manufacturing defect.Poor PackagingInadequate packaging that leads to product damage during transit.A fragile item like glassware breaks during shipping due to insufficient padding.Wrong Item ShippedSending an incorrect product or a variation different from what the customer ordered.A customer orders a size 'L' shirt but receives size 'S'.Expired ProductsParticularly for consumables or beauty products, if an expired product is sent, it directly impacts the seller’s accountability.A cosmetic item delivered past its expiration date.Missing Parts or AccessoriesProducts with missing components or accessories.A smartphone shipped without a charger or user manual.Delays in FulfillmentFailing to fulfill an order on time, leading to customer dissatisfaction.An item promised for next-day delivery arrives after a week.Customer Complaints About QualityReturns due to dissatisfaction with product quality, even if subjective.A customer claims the fabric of a garment feels cheap compared to the description. Impact of High SCRR Performance Metrics: High SCRR rates negatively affect your seller performance score, which can lead to account warnings or suspension. Loss of Buy Box: Sellers with frequent SCRR issues may lose access to the coveted Amazon Buy Box. Reduced Profit Margins: Frequent returns lead to increased costs due to reverse logistics and damaged inventory. Program Ineligibility: High SCRR rates can disqualify sellers from programs like Amazon Prime or Seller Fulfilled Prime. How SCRR Impacts SAFE-T Claims Amazon's SAFE-T (Seller Assurance for E-commerce Transactions) claims process allows sellers to seek reimbursements for losses due to issues beyond their control. However, when returns are classified under SCRR, it can directly impact your eligibility for SAFE-T claims. For example, if the return is due to poor packaging or an inaccurate product description, Amazon may deny your SAFE-T claim, considering it to be the seller's fault. Therefore, managing and minimizing SCRR is key to improving the chances of a successful SAFE-T claim. How to Reduce SCRR ActionDescriptionOptimize Product ListingsEnsure accurate, detailed, and honest descriptions of your products. Include high-quality images and specify dimensions, materials, and features clearly.Quality ControlConduct thorough checks on your inventory before shipping to ensure defect-free and functional products.Improve Packaging StandardsUse robust and secure packaging materials, especially for fragile or perishable items.Fulfill Orders PromptlyMeet shipping timelines consistently and communicate proactively if delays occur.Customer Feedback MonitoringAct on feedback and reviews to identify patterns or recurring issues with specific products.Batch and Expiry ManagementFor consumables, monitor stock closely to avoid sending products nearing expiration. Leveraging WareIQ's Returns QC App To further enhance returns management and reduce SCRR, consider utilizing WareIQ's Returns QC App. This app automates the collection of high-quality visual documentation during the returns process, ensuring compliance with marketplace guidelines and providing robust evidence for claims. By integrating this tool into your operations, you can streamline returns processing, improve claim approval rates, and maintain better control over your return metrics. Non-SCRR Returns Returns that are not classified as SCRR are typically situations where the seller is not at fault, such as: Customer Change of Mind: The customer changes their mind or finds a better alternative. Product Doesn't Fit or Suit Preferences: Returns due to subjective preferences or size-related issues. Shipping Damage by Carrier: Items damaged during transit by the shipping provider. Incorrect Address Provided by Customer: Delivery issues caused by incorrect shipping information supplied by the buyer.

For accurate pricing, it's crucial to measure and weigh packages precisely.\\nDistance and Destination\\nThe distance a package travels significantly impacts the service charge.

Utilizing UPS flat-rate boxes or standard packaging materials ensures optimal weight and size, minimizing extra fees. For more packaging tips, refer to [UPS Packaging Guidelines](https://www.ups.com/us/en/services/shipping/package-options.page).\\nCompare Shipping Carriers\\nBefore finalizing your shipment, compare UPS rates with other carriers like FedEx or USPS. Tools like [Parcel Monkey](https://www.parcelmonkey.com/) allow you to compare rates and choose the most cost-effective option.\\nSchedule Pickups\\nScheduling pickups instead of dropping off packages at UPS locations can save both time and money. UPS often offers discounted rates for scheduled pickups, especially for businesses with regular shipping needs.\\nUtilize Online Tools\\nUsing UPS's online tools for managing shipments and tracking packages helps avoid additional fees associated with incorrect addresses or missed deliveries. The [UPS My Choice](https://www.ups.com/us/en/services/tracking/mychoice.page) service provides enhanced tracking and delivery management features.\\nUnderstanding Accessorial Fees and Surcharges\\nAccessorial fees are additional charges that UPS applies on top of standard shipping costs. These fees can include:\\nAddress Correction Fees: Charged when the provided delivery address is incorrect or incomplete.\\nResidential Delivery Surcharges: Applied when delivering to a residential address instead of a commercial one.\\nFuel Surcharges: Adjusted based on current fuel prices and fluctuates accordingly.\\nIt's essential to understand these fees to accurately estimate your shipping costs and avoid unexpected expenses.\\nNegotiating Better Rates with UPS\\nBusinesses with high shipping volumes can negotiate favorable rates with UPS. Here are some strategies:\\nLeverage Shipping Volume: Present your shipping data to demonstrate consistent volume, which can qualify you for discounts.\\nExclusive Use: Using UPS exclusively for shipping needs can enhance your negotiating power.\\nUtilize UPS Tools: Programs like [UPS My Business Solutions](https://www.ups.com/us/en/services/business.page) offer resources to streamline shipping and reduce costs.\\nRegularly reviewing and renegotiating your rates as your business grows ensures you continue to receive the best possible deals.\\nCommon Mistakes in Estimating UPS Service Charges\\nMistakes in estimating UPS service charges can lead to unexpected expenses. Common errors include:\\nUnderestimating Package Weight or Size: Inaccurate measurements can result in higher fees or package rejection.\\nOverlooking Additional Fees: Failing to account for accessorial fees can inflate your shipping budget.\\nIgnoring Delivery Time Frames: Selecting an expedited delivery option without necessity increases costs.\\nTo avoid these mistakes, ensure accurate measurements, account for all potential fees, and choose delivery options that align with your needs.\\nFuture Trends and Predictions in UPS Service Charges\\nThe shipping industry is evolving, with several trends expected to influence UPS service charges:\\nTechnological Advancements: Automation and AI can enhance efficiency, potentially reducing shipping costs over time.\\nSustainability Initiatives: Increased demand for eco-friendly shipping options may lead to the introduction of green surcharges, reflecting the cost of sustainable practices.\\nGlobal Economic Factors: Fluctuations in fuel prices and international trade policies will continue to impact shipping rates.\\nStaying informed about these trends helps businesses anticipate changes and adjust their shipping strategies accordingly.\\nConclusion\\nUnderstanding UPS service charges is crucial for managing shipping expenses effectively. By recognizing how charges are determined, being aware of influencing factors, and implementing strategies to reduce costs, both individuals and businesses can optimize their shipping practices.

For e-commerce businesses, the cost of shipping your products to customers must be factored into the budget.\\nWith customers growing ever-more demanding, you need to offer fast and affordable shipping options—without cutting into your own profits! It’s essential that you partner with the right shipping carrier, as well as considering your packaging and warehouse locations.\\nContact us today for a customized demo of Brightpearl\\nAnd see how we can help you automate the ordinary and act on the exceptional.\\nBook a demo\\nWe’re going to take you through some effective shipping methods and strategies, and show you ways to reduce costs by finding the right partners and using the best software (like Brightpearl).\\nBasics of Shipping \\nWe’re sure you already know some of this, but it’s worth going over the basics and looking out for ways to keep your shipping costs low. It’s also worth listing all your product weights and sizes, as well as the most common locations for customer orders, so that you have somewhere to start when choosing a carrier.\\nVolume\\nVolume means either the quantity of products you ship, or the size of the individual products. Either way, it’ll make a difference to your costs, so use your sales and customer data to help you predict shipping volume in advance.\\nSmall business owners obviously send out fewer packages than large stores, but there are perks to being small. Many shipping services and third-party fulfillment providers offer small business shipping discounts on delivery and packaging. And, as your order volume increases, you can take advantage of bulk rates.\\nWeight\\nThe weight of each package will also affect the price of shipping—including its dimensional weight (DIM). This is a pricing model based on the parcel’s shape and size, as well as its weight, and most major carriers use it to calculate the cost. Typically, large light parcels cost more than smaller, heavier ones.\\nSource: ups.com\\nShipping companies may also offer flat-rate shipping, which is when you’re charged a set price for a shipment, regardless of its actual weight. Flat-rate boxes are usually available for free from the USPS, UPS, or FedEx.\\nPriority\\nAnother cost implication is the priority level. Most carriers have options including standard ground shipping, express, and overnight delivery, and it’s a good idea to offer multiple shipping methods to your own customers. 88% of consumers don’t mind paying for faster delivery on urgent orders.\\nPackaging\\nAny packaging adds extra weight, but it’s vital that your products are properly protected. Finding the perfect balance is another thing that small firms have to navigate. You also have to think about sustainability (66% of shoppers say they consider this when making a purchase).\\nIf you only sell one type of product, it’s simple to figure out packaging costs, but it’s trickier with a range of different items or one-offs. You may also want to use branded packaging if image is a big part of your business.\\nDelivery Time\\nThe time it takes for a parcel to travel from your facility to the customer will depend on the destination, but also on your shipping carrier and method. If you promise a customer that their order will arrive by a specified time, you need to be sure that it will happen!\\nTo provide accurate delivery times, factor in lead times from your supplier and make sure your order fulfillment process is streamlined in order to ship as fast as possible and avoid errors.\\nDestination\\nThe final factor to consider is the destination, and how far away it is from your fulfillment center. The further the parcel has to travel, the more it’ll cost. Shipping carriers divide geographical areas into zones (the US has eight), and you can reduce costs by minimizing the number of zones your shipment travels through.\\nShipping rates may be different for commercial and residential addresses, and there may be surcharges for weekend or rural delivery. International shipping, of course, is more expensive.\\nSource: nosto.com\\nAutomated order fulfillment with Brightpearl\\nSave 2 months a year vs manual fulfillment\\nBook A Demo\\nShipping Solutions for Small Businesses\\nFrom private carriers like FedEx and DHL to the good old USPS, there are plenty of shipping partners to choose from. And you don’t have to pick just one­—you might find it’s cost-effective to use a private carrier for part of the way, and USPS for last-mile delivery.\\nAlternatively, you could use a shipping platform like Shipstation or Shiptheory (both of which integrate seamlessly with Brightpearl). You’ll need to do your own comparison based on your specific needs, but here’s a flavor of what the major players offer to small businesses.\\nUSPS\\nThe United States Postal Service is often the cheapest option compared to other major carriers, and offers a variety of services for smaller firms including volume discounts and postage calculation tools.\\nThe Click-N-Ship feature lets you pay postage and print labels online, and the Pickup service means you don’t have to visit the post office. You can reserve a PO Box so that business mail doesn’t come to your house, and get a free Priority-Mail Starter Kit. USPS also offers cubic pricing, which enables lower rates for items with small shipping volume (under 20lb) through USPS Priority Mail.\\nUPS\\nUPS provides several small business shipping solutions, such as “UPS Connect” which gives you free brainstorming sessions on your business plan and shipping needs. UPS can even help you get discounts for other areas of your business, including accountancy and marketing.\\nThere are financial and payment services for managing shipping costs, plus handy services like scheduled pickups and returns management. UPS also has an eFulfillment service to help you store and ship products sold on more than 20 platforms.\\nFedEx\\nFedEx also provides services for small companies, with support such as grants and admin assistance as part of an e-commerce center to help online businesses develop. There’s also a useful FAQs hub and glossary of packaging terminology, plus a dimensional weight calculator.\\nYou can schedule pickups, and print custom postcards or coupons to include in parcels. If you sign up for a My FedEx Rewards account, you’ll be rewarded the more you ship. And for perishable items, FedEx offers temperature-controlled shipping packages with cold and heated options.\\nDHL\\nDHL is known for its international delivery services, but that doesn’t rule out small businesses—the carrier aims to help you engage in global trade with a range of services. Fill out a shipping profile on their website and discuss your needs with an expert.\\nDHL Parcel International Standard includes simplified postal customs clearance, reliable transit times and end-to-end tracking, while DHL Express promises delivery by the end of the earliest possible business day. In the US, DHL also partners with the USPS for expedited shipping.\\nWays to Reduce Shipping Costs\\nNo matter which carrier you use, the cost of shipping will be based on the dimensions and weight of the items, the delivery speed, and the distance between origin and destination. The speed of delivery is your choice (or that of your customers), but there are opportunities to reduce costs for the other aspects.\\nNegotiate\\nDon’t be afraid to negotiate with major carriers—they’re used to it and you may find them more receptive than you think. If you regularly ship large volumes, they’ll be glad of your custom and happy to give you a deal on bulk shipping. And, as we’ve already mentioned, smaller businesses can often enjoy special discounts while they grow.\\nAlthough sticking with one carrier keeps things simple, it can be more cost-effective to negotiate favorable rates with a number of providers. For example, you could use one firm for local delivery and another for country-wide shipping.\\nAffordable Packaging\\nSource: manufacturinghub.io\\nThe cost of packaging can quickly add up—especially if you don’t pay attention to the weight. Try to use lightweight options such as corrugated boxes, air pillows, packing paper, and bubble wrap. Pack items tightly together if you can, and consolidate orders in one package to use fewer boxes.\\nIf all your products are a similar size, you can buy packaging in bulk. You can reuse good-quality boxes and packing material, so don’t throw anything out when a new delivery arrives from your supplier!\\nOutsource Shipping\\nShipping can be a time-consuming task—your business may not have the resources to carry out every task in-house, and you’ll soon run out of space to store your stock. One option is to outsource shipping to a third-party logistics (3PL) provider or a dropshipper.\\n3PL companies are logistics experts and can easily manage shipping and returns on your behalf. They often offer extra services like order management, usually from a network of fulfillment centers. If you don’t want the whole nine yards, try a hybrid shipping strategy using both in-house and 3PL or dropshipping services.\\nWarehouse Location\\nWhen you’re aiming to reduce the cost of delivery, there’s no point having a warehouse that’s nowhere near your customer base—your parcels would have to travel through multiple zones and you’d have to fork out for expedited delivery on urgent orders.\\nEven for small businesses, it makes sense to own or rent warehouse space in several strategic locations and split your stock between them, so that parcels travel a shorter distance. (If you’re taking the multi-warehouse approach, it’s easy to manage transfers and inventory with Brightpearl.)\\nQualities of the Right Shipping Partner\\nSource: dtsone.com\\nEvery business has unique needs, so do your research and select a reliable, trustworthy partner who offers all the services you require.\\nDropshipping\\nA dropshipping partner is a firm that handles your shipping, without you having to store or process any inventory yourself. The dropshipper, usually a manufacturer or wholesaler, ships orders direct to the customer.\\nBy cutting out the middleman, dropshipping helps you reduce the costs of storage, transportation, and labor. However, you’re relinquishing control, so make sure your partner shares your commitment to customer service.\\nYou could decide to use dropshipping only for your larger products to save on space, and store and ship smaller items yourself.\\nNetworking\\nIt’s crucial to choose shipping partners with whom you can build strong relationships and find the right balance of price and convenience. As with all partnerships, good communication is vital—they should be willing to share information so that you know in advance about any supply chain issues.\\nYou want to minimize both costs and delivery times, so look for partners in the areas closest to your customer base. As we’ve mentioned, there’s no need to pick just one. You can negotiate deals with several companies, or use existing hybrid arrangements such as FedEx SmartPost and UPS SurePost, both of which hand your package to the USPS for last-mile delivery.\\nPackaging\\nAs well as getting a fair deal on shipping rates, you’ll want to work with a partner who advises you on the best packaging and how to calculate costs. For example, FedEx and UPS use the dimensional pricing model, so you’ll be aware that you need to optimize your packaging to save money.\\nAll the major carriers offer flat-rate shipping, where you use carrier-provided, standard packaging. And they usually give you free standard packaging, which is great for small businesses. Even if not all your products will fit into standard boxes, you can save money by using it for some orders.\\nSource: ecwid.com\\nTechnology\\nTechnology makes it much easier to manage the shipping process, so look for a shipping partner who uses advanced tools to track shipments and sync that information with your own business systems.\\nFor example, the right software will ensure you receive real-time updates each time a package is dispatched, plus data on its estimated delivery time. If you work with a 3PL, they will have a computer system that streamlines all processes and provides analytics to help you make decisions.\\nHow to Charge Your Customers \\nFiguring out how much to charge your customers for shipping is a challenge for small businesses. If you tempt them with free shipping, how will you offset the cost? Is it viable for you to provide next-day or two-day delivery? What about international customers?\\nIf your shipping costs are seen as too high, it may cause people to abandon their shopping cart—whereas one study shows that companies can increase orders by 90% by offering free shipping.\\nWhatever you decide to do, it’s important to display your shipping policy clearly on your website. Putting a guarantee on your shipping will reassure your customers that you are able to meet their expectations and will fix any problems that might occur.\\nFree Shipping \\nFree shipping is beloved by all customers. Many people are willing to wait a little longer for non-urgent orders if the delivery is free. Often, they’re even prepared to add extra items to their cart just to qualify for free shipping.\\nSource: me.me\\nBut if you offer this option, who’s going to pay for it? You can either pass on the costs to customers by baking it into the price of your products, or agree to bear the cost yourself, which may mean making cuts elsewhere in the business. Look carefully at your budget, sales figures, and customer data to help you decide.\\nYou may find it cost-effective to set a minimum order value for free shipping, and promote small add-ons for larger items so that it’s easy for customers to top up the total price. Performing A/B testing will help you understand your customers’ preferences.\\nFlat-rate Shipping\\nFlat-rate shipping is also appealing, because shoppers can order as much as they want without seeing the total rise exponentially as they add to their cart. As well as covering various sizes and weights, a flat rate can also make the cost of long-distance shipping the same as local delivery.\\nIf most of your parcels are the same size, and most of your custom comes from a specific region, flat-rate shipping can work well for you. If not, you’ll find yourself shouldering extra costs (or hiking up your product prices). The flat rate should be high enough to cover more expensive deliveries.\\nHowever, you don’t have to set one flat rate for everything—you can offer a different price for different service levels. And flat-rate shipping helps your business convert variable costs into fixed costs.\\nReal-time Rates\\nFree and flat-rate shipping don’t take into account the fact that carrier rates can fluctuate, based on events in the global supply chain. And while a good shipping partner should update you regularly on price changes, it’s time-consuming to keep changing the information on your website.\\nAnother option is to offer real-time rates, which update automatically so that your customers always see the current information. This involves integrating your system with that of your shipping carrier so that the prices are pulled in and displayed on your site at checkout.\\nShipping Strategies for Small Businesses\\nThere are a number of strategies you can use to optimize shipping, including outsourcing and using specialized software. It’s a good idea to evaluate your shipping strategy regularly to ensure that it’s working for you.\\nMulti-channel\\nToday’s customers demand the convenience and choice of multichannel retail—and the more channels you operate, the more you can sell. This includes your own physical and online stores, e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, or even selling via social media.\\nIf you’re selling with a marketplace, make sure you check the criteria carefully to know what you can and can’t sell, as well as any other rules (for instance, you can’t use your own packaging with Amazon). You also need to deliver accurate shipping information, as too many errors can get you kicked off the platform.\\nFulfilling orders from multiple channels obviously makes your logistics more complex, including returns management. You need to keep a close eye on your inventory and sync data between all channels. Brightpearl helps you do this, as well as setting different shipping methods for different channels.\\nMulti-carrier\\nAs we mentioned earlier, it can be cost-effective to mix and match your shipping partners in order to find the best deals for various package types and destinations. Most small businesses work with two or more carriers for this reason. If you keep an up-to-date record of your product weights, you will find it easier to make comparisons.\\nWhen it comes to choosing carriers, it’s not just about the lowest rates—look for those offering guaranteed delivery times and robust insurance to cover you for any delays or damage. Evaluate your relationships regularly to make sure everything’s working smoothly, and renegotiate if necessary.\\nOutsource\\nSource: selecthub.com\\nFor small businesses with limited resources, it can make sense to outsource some or all of your operations to a third-party logistics provider. This might be just shipping, or the entire fulfillment process. And it could be for all your products or just some of them.\\nThanks to the 3PL’s expertise, you should be better able to manage your customer experiences. But you’ll also have to give up control, which can be hard when you’ve built the business from scratch. It’s vital that you select a trusted partner, and that you ensure your budget allows for the cost of outsourcing.\\nShipping Software\\nAs well as finding a carrier who uses the best technology to ensure swift and accurate shipping, your business needs its own software to help you streamline your in-house operations and share critical data with your partners.\\nLook for something that enables you to create smooth workflows using automation, and gives you real-time insights into every corner of the business from inventory to shipping. You could choose a standalone solution, or go for a complete retail operating system that incorporates shipping and fulfillment tools.\\nOptimize Shipping With Brightpearl\\nAs an all-in-one retail operating system, Brightpearl is an affordable way for smaller businesses to get the tools they need—including features designed for a smooth shipping process. Thanks to the powerful Automation Engine, you can save a ton of time on things like creating shipping labels, pick lists, packing slips, and customs forms.\\nYou can set the system to select the most suitable carrier based on order type and weight, and ship items differently according to their sales channel. Brightpearl also lets you create dropshipping rules for specific customers, channels, or products. It’s easy to automate multi-channel, multi-warehouse, or order splitting for partial fulfillment.\\nThe platform has integrations with all the major carriers (as well as Amazon FBA and 3PL providers), so you can mix and match to get the best deals, and offer your customers flexible shipping options. It’s easy to manage and communicate with your partners, sharing and syncing data to avoid errors or last-minute changes.\\nMeanwhile, the Inventory Planner tool enables you to pull in CBM weight information so that it displays on your purchase orders. You can always see how heavy each package will be, and figure out the most cost-effective way to ship it. It also helps with working out your landed costs.\\nBenefits of Using Brightpearl\\nHere are a few more reasons for choosing Brightpearl:\\nProductivity\\nWith automation replacing most manual tasks, you’ll save time and reduce errors. For example, barcode scanners make it easy to log new deliveries, locate products in the warehouse, and fulfill every order correctly. Plus, with all your tools (and integrations) in one platform, there’s no time wasted on toggling between different apps.\\nVisibility\\nBrightpearl gives you real-time insight into the status of your inventory, orders, and finances. Data from all sales channels, warehouses, customers, and suppliers is housed in a central hub and synced instantly when orders are picked, packed, and shipped. Ensure your stores are showing accurate stock availability, get replenishment alerts, and spot any problems early.\\nForecasting\\nThis visibility makes it much easier to avoid stockouts and excess stock, and to plan ahead. Use the reporting and analytics tools to view sales history and product performance. Work out the most popular areas for orders and make sure you have a warehouse or fulfillment partner nearby—then you can set shipping rates accordingly.\\nCustomer-centric\\nBrightpearl includes a retail-focused CRM, so you can keep tabs on customer preferences and behaviors. You can even reward your best customers by offering them faster shipping or automatically adding free gifts to orders. And the POS system helps you satisfy shoppers by checking availability, fulfilling orders from alternative locations, or placing backorders.  \\nGrow Fearlessly\\nYour business may have started small, but Brightpearl shares your ambitions to expand—and your dedicated Customer Success Team will be with you every step of the way. The SaaS subscription model is scalable and flexible, so you can adjust your tech stack as required. Plus, there’s 24/7 support, training, and implementation.\\nWant to find out more about how Brightpearl can benefit your business?\\nGet a customized, free demo now!\\nBook A Demo\\nFinal Thoughts\\nYour customers expect flexible shipping options, and preferably fast and free delivery!

From January 27, 2019, the rate for a 1 lb Priority Mail package went from $6.70 to $7.35, while the Priority Mail Small Flat Rate Shipping box went from $7.20 to $7.90 – a 9.7% increase for both services.\\nThe Medium Flat Rate Shipping Box and Large Flat Rate Shipping Box will see a 5.1% and 5.5% increase, respectively.\\nThe dimensional weight (DIM weight) divisor will change from 194 to 166.\\nChanging the divisor to a smaller number means a higher weight per cubic foot will be applied - effectively increasing costs if your shipment is under the dimensional weight. Reducing your parcel size and making sure you have efficient packaging can prevent overpaying on shipping.\\nDIM weight will also be applied to all zones for Priority Mail parcels over 1 cubic foot.\\nPreviously, DIM weight was only applied to parcels being shipped to Zones 5-9. This, combined with the reduction of the DIM weight divisor means that small businesses will have to factor in both weight and distance when estimating their shipping costs.\\nDo note that while the rate increases go into effect in January, the DIM weight divisor change and DIM zone changes won’t go into effect until June 23, 2019.\\nFirst Class Mail will now be priced according to zones.\\nFirst Class Mail is the solution for packages weighing under 15.99 oz. Previously, rates were dependent on the weight of the item. Now, distance will factor into the rate, meaning it will now cost more to ship these packages over longer distances.\\nPriority Mail International saw average rate increases between 3-5%.\\nUSPS’ core solution for shipping packages internationally were not immune to rate increases. However, USPS doesn’t apply additional charges such as fuel and residential delivery like express couriers do, still making it an economical choice for those shipping overseas.\\n{{ compare-the-best-rates-in-seconds }}\\n2019 FedEx Rate Increases\\nFedEx Express and FedEx Ground rates increased an average of 4.9%.\\nThis increase is in response to the growth of eCommerce sales and the need to meet ever increasing consumer demands. These rate increases went into effect for US customers on January 7, 2019.\\nWorking with a shipping reseller like Easyship can help you access already discounted rates without having to meet volume requirements, allowing your business to offer competitive rates for express shipping options.\\nCertain shipping surcharges and fees have also increased, possibly affecting the total shipping rate.\\nExamples of affected surcharges include:\\nDelivery Area Surcharge - U.S. Express Package Services, FedEx Ground (Residential): increasing from $4 to $4.20, a 5% increase.\\nResidential Delivery Charge - U.S. Express Package Services, U.S. Ground Services, International Ground Service: increasing from $4.15 to $4.40 per package, a 6% increase.\\nAddress correction: increasing from $15 to $16 per correction, a 6.6% increase.\\nReduce cart abandonment by being upfront about your shipping costs with customers. Having consistent messaging throughout your website about additional costs (on your home page, FAQ, and product pages) will prepare customers for what they should expect at checkout.\\nAdditionally, ensure you are collecting accurate customer details by having an address verification at checkout. This will reduce the amount of address corrections, and subsequently, failed deliveries.\\nVisit FedEx.com for the complete list of changes.\\n2019 UPS Rate Increases\\nSimilar to FedEx, the rates for UPS® Ground, UPS Air and International services will increase an average net 4.9%.\\nAccording to UPS, these rate increases are meant to support “ongoing expansion and capability enhancements” and became effective on December 26, 2018.\\nTo decide whether UPS is the best solution for your business, you can easily compare rates with other couriers using our Get A Quote feature.\\nThe Domestic Air Fuel Surcharge will increase by 0.25% for all thresholds.\\nPer UPS, these surcharges will continue to be based on the national Average U.S. Gulf Coast Jet Fuel Price and adjusted weekly.\\nFuel surcharges are unavoidable when using an express courier. Read our blog post on other hidden fees you may not be aware of when shipping.\\nThe rates for certain value-added services and other charges will increase.\\n\\nExamples of affected surcharges include:\\nThe additional handling fee for packages over 70 lbs in actual weight will increase $4.\\nThe Hazardous Materials (dangerous goods) charge for domestic UPS® Ground Services will increase $2.00.\\nThe Residential Surcharge for domestic UPS® Ground Service, UPS® Standard to/from Canada and UPS® Standard to/from Mexico shipments will increase $0.35.\\nVisit ups.com for the complete list of changes.\\nPreparing your business for shipping GRI’s\\nWork with multiple couriers.\\nBy using a mix of postal, regional, and express couriers, you have a better chance of getting the best rates for every major destination. An additional benefit is the opportunity to provide more delivery choices to your customers. Easily compare rates between multiple couriers by using our Get A Quote feature.\\nRe-think your free shipping policy.\\nWith economical couriers like USPS raising rates to maintain revenues, some small businesses may find it harder to completely cover the costs of free shipping. Consider restricting free shipping to local destinations or refrain offering it year-round.\\nWork with a reseller for additional discounted rates.\\nIf you’re worried that your current shipping volume won’t qualify your business for additional discounts with major couriers, consider working with a company like Easyship. One account will give you access to over 250+ shipping solutions that are discounted up to 70% off retail prices.\\nBy using a shipping software like Easyship, you can also keep track of your shipping costs all in one place, allowing you to easily analyze your spending and help navigate future GRI’s.\\nConclusion\\nWith the volume of eCommerce packages increasing each year, couriers have no choice but to implement general rate increases to be able to process these additional volumes while continuing to uphold demanding customer standards.\\nAs these increases are announced at the end of every year and usually implemented at the beginning of the next year, small businesses should take this opportunity to examine their shipping costs and make adjustments to ensure their shipping strategy is optimized.\\nJUMP TO SECTION\\n2019 USPS Postage Rate Increases\\n2019 FedEx Rate Increases\\n2019 UPS Rate Increases\\nPreparing your business for shipping GRI’s\\nConclusion\\nSave up to 91% on Shipping.

and FedEx?How do shipping and handling fees differ among the different carriers?What different shipping insurance options exist with USPS, UPS and FedEx?How to make smart shipping decisions every time\\nKevin Hernandez\\nUSPS vs UPS vs FedEx: An overview\\nThree major carriers dominate the U.S.parcel shipping market.Although they offer similar rates and services, there may be advantages to using UPS vs USPS, or UPS vs FedEx.So how do you choose?The answer is in the details.We talked to Kevin Hernandez, a shipping and supply chain solutions consultant with years of experience in logistics and the supply chain industry, for insights on each major carrier to help you determine which company offers the best combination of rates, delivery speed, and services for your specific needs.“Choosing between UPS, FedEx, and USPS depends on various factors, such as shipment destination, the weight, the size, the speed, and, ultimately, the budget of the client,” Hernandez says.The major carriers are all well-established, reliable, and have extensive networks.While UPS and FedEx are public companies, the USPS is an independent entity within the executive branch of the U.S.government.The USPS dominates in terms of volume with 32 percent of U.S.parcel shipments, followed by UPS with 24 percent and FedEx with 19 percent.Amazon Logistics and other smaller carriers account for the remaining 25 percent.The USPS is operated by the federal government as a low-cost service to both consumers and businesses.As such, it is required to deliver six days per week to every address and post office box in the U.S., and it is the only one of the major carriers to do so.It also treats deliveries to all U.S.territories, possessions, military bases, and diplomatic posts as domestic shipments.USPS is also the only carrier to offer Saturday delivery free of charge.By contrast, both UPS and FedEx are for-profit corporations that are primarily business oriented.They differentiate themselves with faster speed, more customizable delivery and specialized services designed for specific business needs.Both add a surcharge for residential and Saturday deliveries.A look at the chart below reveals that the carriers and their offerings are comparable in many ways.But there are many factors that must be considered when choosing which carrier you should be working

iceberg.There are many other factors to the equation, and this article will examine most of them.That said, although there are differences, the carriers’ base rates don’t tend to vary a great deal.In fact, UPS and FedEx prices usually track each other very closely, while USPS rates are generally lower because the postal service is not a for-profit enterprise.“For example, USPS may be cheaper for a 10-pound box, while UPS and FedEx might be cheaper for a 30-pound box,” Hernandez explains.“Shippers should compare the rates and services offered by each carrier to determine the most cost-effective option for their shipment, which is what I always advise my clients to do.So just make sure that you look at everybody, because, again, USPS might be better for a 2-pound package, but UPS might be a lot better for a 20-pound package.So, it all kind of depends on what you’re shipping and where you’re shipping to.”At the time of publication, all three carriers’ flat rate and ground shipping rates start in the vicinity of $10.Overnight shipping costs start at more than double that amount.Rates go up as package size, weight and shipping distance increase.At the same time, the costs of surcharges and fees for value-added services have been rising faster than base rates.All in all, it’s more important than ever to know what your options are, so that you can control spending and optimize the customer experience.Between USPS, UPS and FedEx, which carrier is the best for the way you ship?Price and speed are always important considerations in selecting which shipping company to use.But there may be other factors that are equally important – and may even be more important – in your decision making.Do you prefer the simplicity of flat rate shipping?Do you need fast delivery for perishable items?Are you shipping small high-ticket items such as jewelry and designer watches?Do you need to ship hazardous materials?“When choosing a shipping carrier, you should consider various factors, such as the rates, delivery, speed, reliability, and customer service,” Hernandez adds.“Those are very specific and important needs.”Flat rate shipping\\nBoth FedEx and UPS provide savings, free packaging and a choice of delivery speed.By contrast, USPS offers low rates, and the 1-3 day delivery speed is satisfactory in many cases.Shippers can choose from a wide variety of packages – all of which are provided free of charge.Package pickup and tracking are also free, and there is no extra charge for Saturday delivery.However only FedEx offers Pak and tube options.Small, lightweight packages\\nIt’s very challenging for other carriers to compete with USPS, which offers a combination of low rates and speedy, six-day-per-week delivery to businesses and residences.Delivery by mail carrier keeps costs low.However, both FedEx and UPS offer considerable savings with flat-rate shipping, with your choice of delivery speed.They have also been very successful catering to businesses with early morning delivery of important documents via overnight envelope.Large packages\\nAlthough overnight envelopes and paks may be more common, all three carriers can and do accept large and even oversized packages for shipment.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"LH9yWdbKmltmNJNlGcLilI8xVxrznUiARlzGCNgGAvg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"60aa1967-9fe1-4d8d-86a2-338dcf39dc94":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"60aa1967-9fe1-4d8d-86a2-338dcf39dc94\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/blog/usps-vs-ups-vs-fedex-best-rates.html\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"59f200be-56c6-43dd-830e-6039efcbf08f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/blog/usps-vs-ups-vs-fedex-best-rates.html\"},\"hash\":\"shCicdMVO1WVXtcQTgDkfV+zFViyEqJGjb40jZeZLXs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"75096615-9ad1-4360-a647-5ddbfa703695\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/blog/usps-vs-ups-vs-fedex-best-rates.html\"},\"hash\":\"ZbSS+h1v9uIMhDBN9eRSt0qmhru04cdAwO9AYlEmPK4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"a35a3869-252f-42ba-97b1-be7c646eac7d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"os3DRpaavFiOlP7jyppLT49dNaNtF+trYcng2qWKENw=\"}},\"text\":\"By

documents via overnight envelope.Large packages\\nAlthough overnight envelopes and paks may be more common, all three carriers can and do accept large and even oversized packages for shipment.Until recently, the USPS never charged additional fees, but in 2022 they implemented new non-standard fees for packages that measure more than 14 inches in length or more than two cubic feet in volume.FedEx and UPS both treat oversized packages in much the same way; the difference is in the details.Both apply special handling charges or oversize package surcharges but waive special handling fees when adding the oversize surcharge to your bill.Special handling fees range from roughly $20 to $30 per package; oversize surcharges tend to be much heftier, in excess of $100 per package.It's important to note that these additional charges go up during times of peak shipping demand, so it’s smart to shop rates during the holiday season.Good shipping software will let you see and compare these charges before you ship, instead of getting surprised by unexpected chargebacks to your account.Heavy packages\\nWhen it comes to shipping heavier packages, each carrier has its own pros and cons.If you are shipping heavy packages weighing 70 lbs.or less, USPS offers low rates, but not the fastest delivery.FedEx and UPS both accept packages weighing up to 150 lbs.but the cost for getting them delivered overnight is high, and they both impose surcharges for overweight packages.However, if the items to be shipped can fit into either carrier’s free flat rate shipping packages, it’s possible to greatly reduce shipping costs without compromising delivery speed.Overnight shipping\\nAll three carriers compete vigorously in the attempt to capture a larger share of the overnight shipping market.UPS and FedEx rates tend to be very similar.Both guarantee next-day delivery and will issue a refund for late deliveries not attributable to events beyond their control.By contrast, USPS rates tend to be lower but next day delivery is not always guaranteed.FedEx has the most overnight options for residential deliveries; FedEx Priority Overnight® shipments will arrive by noon, while FedEx Standard Overnight® shipments will arrive by 8:00 pm.UPS Next Day Air® Saver, the only UPS overnight option for residential deliveries, guarantees delivery by end of day.There are also some differences in geographic coverage.All three cover the entire Continental US, but only UPS includes Puerto Rico.Both FedEx and UPS focus their earliest next-day delivery services on cities and highly populated areas.If you are shipping to remote areas in the lower 48, Priority Mail Express becomes more competitive.High-value shipping\\nUPS offers optional coverage for declared values up to $50,000 per package, or an enhanced option of up to $70,000 for certain domestic packages subject to specific terms and conditions.FedEx Declared Value Advantage program allows frequent shippers of jewelry, gemstones or precious metals to declare a value up to $100,000 per shipment.The program is not applicable to one-time or occasional shipments, and prior qualification is required for participation.Shipping hazardous materials\\nThe USPS allows you to ship many common hazardous materials such as fragrances, hand sanitizer or lithium batteries provided that they are properly packaged and labeled.They’ll even pick your shipment up free of charge.Both UPS and FedEx require that you open an account to ship hazardous materials.In addition, FedEx requires advance approval, and only accepts hazardous material shipments at certain FedEx locations.Both companies impose a dangerous goods surcharge for air shipments.Which shipping carrier has the best discounts?Discount programs are available from every major carrier, so no business that ships parcels on a regular basis should be paying retail rates.Shipping discounts are an important way to reduce costs, and they’re easy to obtain, even if you aren’t currently a high-volume shipper.Discounts may be the factor that determines, for example, whether UPS or FedEx is the cheaper option.So, it makes good sense for shippers to take advantage of every available discount.“It ultimately depends on the volume of shipments,” Hernandez notes.“When it comes to big shippers, they have a lot of power, and I don't think a lot of them understand that.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"RsWy6QZOBGiS7S1oAqAqCqIx16/NqYr8OvJzo7JJ30c=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a35a3869-252f-42ba-97b1-be7c646eac7d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a35a3869-252f-42ba-97b1-be7c646eac7d\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/blog/usps-vs-ups-vs-fedex-best-rates.html\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"59f200be-56c6-43dd-830e-6039efcbf08f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/blog/usps-vs-ups-vs-fedex-best-rates.html\"},\"hash\":\"shCicdMVO1WVXtcQTgDkfV+zFViyEqJGjb40jZeZLXs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"60aa1967-9fe1-4d8d-86a2-338dcf39dc94\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/blog/usps-vs-ups-vs-fedex-best-rates.html\"},\"hash\":\"XB+NC8XBHqgzaubllPzS9bkHJ02yINl5iPSYKSh8eHE=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"9a618ba0-2063-44e7-b929-7660172d29be\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"k+PmkVEUQzBkMa9g/9B9efPY/di4SEGi2wYKipoFz00=\"}},\"text\":\"They’ll

FedEx Office® print and copy services\\nWhich shipping carrier is the fastest?Today, all of the major carriers offer fast delivery throughout the contiguous 48 states.UPS and FedEx are often faster than USPS, because they offer overnight delivery and even same day service in certain densely populated areas.However, although both provide overnight delivery, one or the other may be the fastest to certain Alaska, Hawaii or remote destinations within the Continental U.S.The best way to find the fastest shipping method for critical deliveries is using multi-carrier shipping software like PitneyShip® and PitneyShip® Pro.Speed comparison of FedEx vs UPS overnight delivery\\nDestination UPS Fedex\\nAnchorage, Ak 8:30 am 11:00 am\\nHonolulu, HI 11:00 pm noon\\nPlentywood, MT 11:00 pm 4:30 pm\\nEureka, NV 2:00 pm 4:40 pm\\n“Delivery times can vary depending on the carrier, origin, and destination,” Hernandez says.“I’ve had clients ship product from New York to New Jersey, and they’ve had it there the next day, while others have taken multiple days.So, delivery times can vary based on a lot of factors such as weather conditions and package value.”Which shipping carrier is best for weekend shipments?All three carriers offer Saturday delivery as an option.Deciding which is the best choice depends on what is most important to you: the earliest possible delivery or not having to pay an additional fee.Only USPS delivers to all US businesses and residences on Saturday at no extra charge.The mail carrier will also pick up your outgoing packages on Saturday.And because the USPS processes mail every day of the week, your package will be on its way without delay.Both FedEx and UPS provide Saturday delivery, but it may not be available with every shipping option, and you’ll

although it’s not required.All three carriers offer the choice of either a one-time pickup or recurring pickups.Both FedEx and UPS have flexible options for recurring pickups; both require an account.USPS offers two pickup options for packages with prepaid postage affixed.With a package pickup service, you can simply hand outgoing packages to the mail carrier.It’s free as long as the pickup is part of the mail carrier’s regular route.There’s only a charge if a special trip is required.Pickup On Demand, which is available in most Zip codes, lets you schedule pickups for time-sensitive shipments online for a fee.FedEx requires that one-time pickups must be scheduled online.Account holders can set up recurring pickups (daily or at regular intervals) online or by contacting customer service.A fee applies to all pickups except regularly scheduled Express pickups.You can schedule a one-time UPS pickup online or by calling an 800 number.To save delivery fees, you can hand outgoing packages to the UPS driver while they are making a delivery to you.Setting up recurring deliveries requires a UPS.com payment account.Choices include daily, automatic or day-specific pickups., Plus, you can save even more with free or discounted package pickups when using a shipping software solution from Pitney Bowes.How do shipping and handling fees differ among the different carriers?Shipping and handling fees are determined by the shipper, not the carrier.Shipping fees are only one component of this cost, which also includes all expenses related to fulfilling an order such as packaging, labor and overhead.See this article on shipping and handling for a full explanation.On the other hand, carriers will charge special handling fees for packages that are oversized, overweight, oddly shaped or otherwise difficult to handle.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"xbS1jTa8JvLsLDPiBfUSvJOW0Yv0Qe/RA/xpgU9ycGA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3ac4e54f-c29b-4d26-8075-e2a746eaae78":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3ac4e54f-c29b-4d26-8075-e2a746eaae78\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/blog/usps-vs-ups-vs-fedex-best-rates.html\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"59f200be-56c6-43dd-830e-6039efcbf08f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/blog/usps-vs-ups-vs-fedex-best-rates.html\"},\"hash\":\"shCicdMVO1WVXtcQTgDkfV+zFViyEqJGjb40jZeZLXs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9a618ba0-2063-44e7-b929-7660172d29be\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/blog/usps-vs-ups-vs-fedex-best-rates.html\"},\"hash\":\"k+PmkVEUQzBkMa9g/9B9efPY/di4SEGi2wYKipoFz00=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"bdf8aa45-1190-4954-8857-bc4911494484\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"GNl4pVyPP3b/xAUSW3aXtawMLlcq8jGXjP7728pTtA8=\"}},\"text\":\"A

otherwise difficult to handle.Because these fees can be very costly, it may make sense to ship these items as freight.What different shipping insurance options exist with USPS, UPS and FedEx?UPS, FedEx and the USPS all offer shipping insurance coverage for up to $100 in declared value free of charge.Declared value is the carrier’s maximum liability in connection with the shipment of a package, including any loss, damage, delay, or mis-delivery.Shippers can purchase additional coverage for packages worth more than that amount.Comparison of insurance options by carrier\\n  UPS FedEx USPS\\nDeclared value up to $100 Free Free Free with Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express\\nDeclared value over $100 1.15% of value 1.25% value Percentage varies\\nMaximum coverage\\n(per package)

every time\\nIt’s clear that no single carrier will always be the best choice for every shipment.But how can you know which carrier and shipping option to choose for any individual package?The complexity of various rates, weights, dimensions, distance and delivery speeds makes calculations very difficult, if not impossible to carry out quickly and accurately.Plus, the best choice may be counterintuitive; for example, when ground shipping is the cheapest option for overnight delivery to nearby zones.Not to mention, carrier shipping rates are constantly changing and rates are subject to change at any time.“UPS, FedEx, and USPS are all reliable, efficient shipping carriers,” Hernandez concludes.“There may be some instances where one might be better than the other, but it all depends on the client and what their shipping needs are.”That’s why savvy shippers rely on shipping software from Pitney Bowes to simplify the shipping process and ensure that they get the best deal

LUG 2019 8 MIN READ\\nTH\\nBangkok\\nThe UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper™ study takes a closer look at the purchasing habits of online shoppers around the world\\n2019 Asia Pacific study focuses on buyers in Australia, China, Hong Kong and South Korea, and for the first time features a section on the business purchaser\\nResults reveal Asia Pacific customers are willing to spend more on an order if it reduces cost of shipping; also most likely globally to make use of alternative delivery services\\n92% of Asia Pacific business purchasers want all aspects of their delivery managed by the supplier or shipper\\nNew research commissioned by UPS (NYSE: UPS) into what consumers want from their online shopping experience reveals that those in Asia Pacific seek visibility throughout the purchase cycle and incentives that add value to the shopping process.Customised shipping options and fuss-free returns policies are also appreciated, but the study highlights that regional satisfaction with returns is low.Now in its seventh year, the UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper™ studysheds light on consumer online shopping behaviour.It also, for the first time, features insights into the buying habits of business purchasers.Conducted in Australia, China, Hong Kong and South Korea, as well as 11 other markets across the Americas, Europe and India, the study tracks evolving trends and demands from e-commerce customers.Narrowing in on the moments that matter in the purchase journey, the research unearths valuable insights for businesses looking to grow their customer base in Asia Pacific.The findings reveal three overarching factors that impact consumers’ purchasing decisions – visibility across the purchase journey, incentives offered, and ways in which shoppers can customise their purchase and delivery experience.“Consumers in Asia Pacific are increasingly knowledgeable about the options available to them when shopping online, and this is driving a demand for complete clarity and access to information throughout the purchase journey, as well as greater flexibility in both the shopping and shipping process,” said Sylvie Van den Kerkhof, Vice President of Marketing, UPS Asia Pacific.“As consumers are presented with more options to buy online and competition increases, expectations are becoming more refined and retailers need to be agile enough to stay ahead of the trends.The ability to offer incentives not just in the form of a unique product offering but also in the shipping and delivery experience will be crucial to success in the evolving e-commerce landscape.”\\\"The value of the Thai e-commerce industry is expected to grow from US$3 billion in 2018 to US$13 billion by 20251.A large portion of this is driven by cross-border e-commerce and high demand for Thai products,” said Russell Reed, Managing Director of UPS Thailand and Vietnam.“The Asia Pacific edition of the UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper™ study helps retailers in Thailand tap into this rapid growth by providing more in-depth analysis of customer purchasing behaviours across the region.The patterns and trends revealed by the study can then be leveraged to ensure that overseas customers are receiving the service they expect, in turn maximising customer loyalty and the potential for repeat business.”Shoppers want answers before they commit\\nA significant 90% of all consumers globally research their product before proceeding with a purchase.While price is the most commonly researched information worldwide, by comparison it is less important for consumers in Asia Pacific (74%), than for those in the Americas and Europe (both 81%).Reviewing a retailer’s returns policy is often part of the pre-purchase process, with 42% of online shoppers in Asia Pacific doing this before making a transaction, reinforcing why it is important that retailers make this information clear and easy to find.Furthermore, the findings identify that shoppers may cancel a purchase when they find out the retailer is based internationally, if they were unaware of this initially.77% of shoppers in China have done this, as well as 65% in Australia, and 60% in Hong Kong and South Korea.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"BxF3ufl6Le+0mBWAon7601h5jZdrhJY6GMBk7S4gMOU=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c70f8141-dc82-4e2d-8fb6-924bb7e46996":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c70f8141-dc82-4e2d-8fb6-924bb7e46996\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://about.ups.com/it/it/newsroom/press-releases/customer-first/ups-research-shows-online-shoppers-in-asia-pacific-value-information-and-customised-shipping-room-for-improvement-with-returns-th.html\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"43cc4c6e-42de-4482-9658-fb93f220b197\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://about.ups.com/it/it/newsroom/press-releases/customer-first/ups-research-shows-online-shoppers-in-asia-pacific-value-information-and-customised-shipping-room-for-improvement-with-returns-th.html\"},\"hash\":\"4Qy6qTrpUPTbMub4VGvBB4mZqBoHTAAQW6evvRM37nE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"244bf1cc-e20e-4993-8a7c-af19fa2d5c27\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://about.ups.com/it/it/newsroom/press-releases/customer-first/ups-research-shows-online-shoppers-in-asia-pacific-value-information-and-customised-shipping-room-for-improvement-with-returns-th.html\"},\"hash\":\"BxF3ufl6Le+0mBWAon7601h5jZdrhJY6GMBk7S4gMOU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"92c1a307-086d-43d0-97a1-1e70f0890fa6\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"L0mzB8qgfNhPb5FszAKk5w3+LMGL5Hi/BgO0CiRYdWA=\"}},\"text\":\"Shoppers

have done this, as well as 65% in Australia, and 60% in Hong Kong and South Korea.At the same time, 75% of all shoppers in Asia Pacific have knowingly made purchases from international sellers, suggesting that online shopping is situational and, with international purchases likely taking longer to arrive, how long a customer is willing to wait may depend on what they are buying.Shipping incentives and customer service drive repeat business\\nContinuing the trend from previous years’ studies, consumers still value free shipping, as highlighted by the fact that high delivery cost is the most common reason for an abandoned shopping cart.Asia Pacific shoppers will often take actions to reduce shipping costs, with 37% indicating that they are willing to add items to their cart to qualify for free shipping, and 27% saying they would purchase an alternative product priced above the retailer’s free-shipping threshold.These figures indicate that shoppers can actually be incentivised to spend more on the actual purchase, if this action will reduce the cost of shipping.In addition to being a key part of the pre-purchase routine, a good returns policy can also encourage customer loyalty.And with just 5% of Asia Pacific shoppers saying they are “very satisfied” with the returns process, there is huge potential for retailers with a good returns policy to rise above the competition.The common causes of dissatisfaction with the returns experience were a delay in receiving refunds (cited by an average of 32% of respondents across the region), having to pay for their own returns (31%) and delays in receiving a replacement product (25%).Furthermore, shoppers have been empowered to “vote with their clicks” when they have bad experiences with a merchant.In Asia Pacific, 93% of consumers who receive poor customer service will either stop using that merchant or reduce how often they purchase from them.This is most apparent with South Korean shoppers; 70% of whom will stop buying from a merchant altogether due to bad customer service.I want it my way\\nThe popularity of alternative delivery locations in Asia Pacific is a continuing trend, with the study finding that only 36% of the region’s consumers prioritise receiving their package in-person at their home – compared to 62% in Europe – while 19% are happy to have the package left on their doorstep or porch.Consumers in Asia Pacific are also more likely to know about and make use of specialised delivery services, such as UPS My Choice®.The ability to select shipping options offers added convenience, with the research revealing that the ability to choose a delivery day has the greatest appeal.As an alternative to purchasing directly from a retailer, marketplaces are also a popular purchasing platform, with 93% of Asia Pacific shoppers having purchased from a marketplace in the three months prior to the survey.The region has notable market-level variations when it comes to the marketplace that businesses should take into account and cater to – 100% of respondents in China had made a purchase from one of these platforms in the three months leading up to the survey, whereas 14% in Australia and 10% in Hong Kong don’t use marketplaces at all, the highest rates of non-usage in the world.Business purchasers think like consumers\\nExpanding the study to cover B2B purchasing this year, the findings show that business buyers follow many of the same trends as consumers.Similar to the consumer shopper, 96% of Asia Pacific buyers consider the ability to track packages important, with the preferred method of tracking deliveries being a carrier’s website.92% of business purchasers would like to see all elements of their delivery managed by the supplier or shipper, and this is particularly so in Hong Kong, where respondents unanimously chose this option.One area where the responses differed however was that while 42% of B2C buyers will check the returns policy before making a purchase, this number jumps to 71% when it comes to business purchasers, even when the buyer already has a contract with the supplier.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"g+Z66j3FA4bsV834epa+U8pHCkhVKauRjBWirrqHgqU=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"92c1a307-086d-43d0-97a1-1e70f0890fa6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"92c1a307-086d-43d0-97a1-1e70f0890fa6\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://about.ups.com/it/it/newsroom/press-releases/customer-first/ups-research-shows-online-shoppers-in-asia-pacific-value-information-and-customised-shipping-room-for-improvement-with-returns-th.html\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"43cc4c6e-42de-4482-9658-fb93f220b197\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://about.ups.com/it/it/newsroom/press-releases/customer-first/ups-research-shows-online-shoppers-in-asia-pacific-value-information-and-customised-shipping-room-for-improvement-with-returns-th.html\"},\"hash\":\"4Qy6qTrpUPTbMub4VGvBB4mZqBoHTAAQW6evvRM37nE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"c70f8141-dc82-4e2d-8fb6-924bb7e46996\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://about.ups.com/it/it/newsroom/press-releases/customer-first/ups-research-shows-online-shoppers-in-asia-pacific-value-information-and-customised-shipping-room-for-improvement-with-returns-th.html\"},\"hash\":\"ppPZyytSq/DfKcpfI1BeSb9QvcTkj0SmkfgliDfR2b8=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"f90c3e71-c8a4-49f9-9097-09cd299b2d9d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"xmxpkfyFKb8U/Fu0aIpKg9GSeCTb/iDDQ4ybRL2BB1E=\"}},\"text\":\"Business

internationally, the highest percentage of all regions surveyed.Of those that purchase internationally, 42% stated that they did so because of higher product quality, while 41% said it was because the product they wanted could only be bought from international suppliers.One area of commonality among business purchasers globally is the importance of knowing the fully-landed cost, or the total price of a product once it arrives at their location.Asia Pacific confirms this trend with 94% of buyers in the region indicating that this is important to them.“For both consumers and business purchasers, the 2019 UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper reveals that here in Asia Pacific, we are navigating a world of choice and we expect to make purchases on our terms,” added Van den Kerkhof.“In a crowded space like e-commerce, the kind of insight revealed by the Pulse of the Online Shopper study can make all the difference in helping businesses stay one step ahead – today, tomorrow, and next year.”1.https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1703148/thai-e-commerce-to-hit-13bn-by-2025\\nAbout the UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper™\\nThe UPS Pulse of the Online Shopper™ global study evaluates

may be tough to calculate since there are so many variables that influence the final cost.But, there are four key pieces of information that you’ll need every time.You should be able to receive an accurate price if you have this information.Here are the four factors that may impact your shipping rates every time:\\nPoints of Origin and Destination for Shipping\\nThe distance traveled by a package from its point of origin to its shipping destination is an important element in determining the cost.In general, the greater the price, the more away you are.Shipping zones are used by couriers to properly calculate the distance a cargo travels from its origin to its final destination.There are now eight shipping zones in the United States, divided by zip code.Although it’s a basic concept, you must first decide the location you are shipping from and the destination to which goods will be delivered before you can begin calculating prices.Gross Weight of the Package\\nThe deadweight of a package refers to its weight.Put it on a scale and find out how much it weighs.The more expensive it is to send a package, the heavier it is.But there’s also dimensional weight to consider.This becomes more intricate and is determined by the dimensions of the box in which you are shipping the products.Dimensions of the Package\\nThe length, breadth, and height of the packaging used to ship the products are the dimensions.Because packages arrive in a variety of sizes, it’s critical for eCommerce retailers to understand how this affects the price.Particularly when couriers charge by dimensional (or volumetric) weight as well.In a nutshell, this is the amount of room a product takes up in the delivery truck.To calculate the dimensional weight, couriers multiply the length, width, and height of your box, then divide the result by a cubic divisor of their choosing.It’s a good idea to understand more about dimensional weight and how to save shipping expenses by optimizing your packaging.These modest measures will help you save money on shipping and receive a more accurate quotation for eCommerce businesses\\nShipping Delivery Times\\nDelivery time refers to the time it takes for a product or cargo to arrive at its destination.Depending on the distance the cargo is travelling, this can range from overnight to over a month, & prices might vary accordingly.It will cost substantially more to get a parcel sent overnight than if you go for a typical 3-7 days delivery period.Before you settle on a shipping cost estimate, you’ll need to determine how quickly you want your products delivered.Value of Products \\nIf you’re delivering high-value items, you should consider having your shipments insured.Senders who have their packages lost, stolen, or damaged in transit can get reimbursed with shipping insurance.This service, while handy, can dramatically increase your delivery costs.Top 6 Factors Influencing Your Shipping Costs in 2024\\nBecause of the many extra taxes dependent on the destination country, the size and weight of the shipment, and the duration of delivery, international shipping can get complicated.It’s critical to do thorough research and properly calculate shipping costs so that your consumers aren’t surprised by exorbitant charges, which is one of the leading causes of shopping cart abandonment in eCommerce.Insurance for Shipments\\nIf you’re shipping costly items, consider obtaining shipping insurance to safeguard against items being lost, stolen, or damaged during transit.The majority of shipments arrive safely, but mistakes can happen, and if you’re delivering high-value items, replacing inventory will cut into your earnings, so it’s important to be insured.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"/AJv4lPibNTyXaKoE1ItcSKLyBoZNVshBQ4vFw7RFsg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f9c6292d-d60d-4976-9e9f-d5aef7d823fa":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f9c6292d-d60d-4976-9e9f-d5aef7d823fa\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://wareiq.com/resources/blogs/calculate-shipping-costs/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"88fc0531-db92-4741-98fe-9c8ed6b928c0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://wareiq.com/resources/blogs/calculate-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"5PLx1Wq2P1ak2Ry3BjEbNSp5kHVdFTTjyjN4OM5PtPM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"ae755eff-bbb8-44c2-8f2b-cc30c6fa317b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://wareiq.com/resources/blogs/calculate-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"jQX9yEOi8Z2eHg3xrx8sjJdsx7sXUyx4cvVkexrqLug=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c529b553-fc83-4b9f-807a-e5d92b8f084e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"XBVkcTWxlJxzxjC27q8utn/+uh8n+oPgNm1yfLJbUyY=\"}},\"text\":\"Senders

damaged during transit.The majority of shipments arrive safely, but mistakes can happen, and if you’re delivering high-value items, replacing inventory will cut into your earnings, so it’s important to be insured.Couriers normally charge a little fee for this service – around 3% of the reported value of your package on average.Another option is to get shipping insurance from a third-party provider, which is usually less expensive.Through the Insurance Settings section of their dashboard, Easyship users can quickly add insurance to their shipments.Cost of Fuel\\nWhen fuel prices, particularly diesel, are greater in a certain location owing to taxes, market pressures, or other geographical variables, shipping charges rise.When fuel prices fall, shipping costs should fall as well.Carriers may raise their charges to protect themselves from abrupt fuel price spikes if fuel costs are variable at the time you’re shipping.Keep in mind that shipping across states is typically more expensive owing to gasoline prices.Fuel prices in each state vary widely depending on local and state taxes.The cost of fuel in your location may differ from the cost of fuel in the shipment area.Fuel surcharge calculators are used by some truckers to estimate these fees, which are usually added to shipping rates.Minimum Costs for Carriers\\nMinimum tariffs apply to all carriers.Regardless of how tiny your package is, if it falls below that level, you will be charged the minimum.Before hiring a shipper or looking into alternative shipping options like FedEx and UPS, you should make sure you have a package that is larger than the bare requirement.Extra Charges\\nIf your package necessitates lift gates, inside delivery, residential delivery, or other access difficulties for drivers, factor them into your freight shipping prices.Dock-to-dock transportation is a specialty of commercial shipping.If you deviate from that, you will be charged for the inconvenience.Accessorial fees might range from delivery to a strip mall to appointments scheduled in advance.Make sure you’re aware of all of the alternatives ahead of time and that you consider them in the price of each task.Related Article: Ways to reduce transportation costs\\nCharges for Handling Dangerous Goods\\nDue to the contents of the package, packing, weight, and dimensions, you may be charged extra costs.Chemicals, needles, weapons, and, most significantly, lithium-ion batteries for eCommerce businesses are examples of risky goods that a courier feels are dangerous to handle.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) defines dangerous products worldwide, therefore that’s the best place to look for an official list.If the parcel exceeds the standard dimension or weight, is constructed of a substance such as wood or metal, or is cylindrical, an extra cost may be charged.It’s a good idea to double-check these costs before buying any boxes or containers.Taxes and Duties\\nBefore your cargo is delivered to another nation, you or the recipient of your product may be requested to pay extra customs and taxes.Duties and taxes may be charged depending on what you’re shipping and how much it costs.These can be complicated and differ from nation to country.You should be aware of two sorts of responsibilities since they are frequently the source of hidden expenses.DDU Shipments (Delivery Duty Unpaid): The recipient is responsible for paying the duty in order for the package to be released from customs.If the recipient refuses to pay the taxes or refuses to accept the delivery, you, as the sender, are still accountable.This is why, as a trader, it’s ideal to keep your overseas shipping charges as transparent as possible.It helps you save money.DDP Shipments (Delivery Duty Paid): The sender is responsible for paying the levy, however, the computation is more complicated.When the shipment reaches the destination country, couriers will charge a “DDP handling fee” for paying the taxes and customs on your behalf.The proportion of taxes and tariffs is used to compute a “disbursement charge.”Yes, it’s complicated, but at the very least, you’ll know that the box won’t be returned because the receiver doesn’t pay or declines it.When the cargo reaches the target country, the couriers will charge you an extra cost for paying the Taxes & Duties on your behalf.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"8ZPUeGOJT7cAtW6EQRWDhKVG3fgX7UUdvfTzaiS3290=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c529b553-fc83-4b9f-807a-e5d92b8f084e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c529b553-fc83-4b9f-807a-e5d92b8f084e\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://wareiq.com/resources/blogs/calculate-shipping-costs/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"88fc0531-db92-4741-98fe-9c8ed6b928c0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://wareiq.com/resources/blogs/calculate-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"5PLx1Wq2P1ak2Ry3BjEbNSp5kHVdFTTjyjN4OM5PtPM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f9c6292d-d60d-4976-9e9f-d5aef7d823fa\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://wareiq.com/resources/blogs/calculate-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"Ked2knBck+RwWClzj8KQlQvVVGhTdOhpOX8LVuRui7E=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"8f3b79a0-42e8-48ec-8b54-aaf96ab2c702\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"HX+iOz2WkP0Kues2JBfpRmsS0i43TVINTWT7xY6YzQE=\"}},\"text\":\"If

fee.Under-declaring items on a commercial invoice might result in extra charges and lengthy delivery delays.If the customs clearing agency feels the claimed value is less than the market value, a fresh invoice is frequently requested, which might result in additional costs.There may be additional warehousing fees for keeping the product if it is not received within the desired time range.In addition, if you under-declare the contents of the box, the courier may charge you.As a result, this is an area where you must exercise extreme caution and pay close attention to the smallest of details.Importance of Calculating/ Estimating Shipping Costs Accurately\\nThere are a lot of businesses out there that don’t take the time to calculate shipping costs accurately.This can lead to many

success.According to a report by the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, inefficient inventory management can lead to significant losses, with companies potentially losing up to 20% of their revenue due to stockouts and excess inventory.This highlights the importance of having a robust system in place to manage stock levels effectively.One such method that has gained traction in the logistics industry is ABC inventory analysis.This technique categorises inventory items based on their importance to the business, allowing organisations to prioritise their resources and optimise stock management.In this guide, we will delve into ABC analysis in inventory management, exploring its benefits, implementation strategies, and practical examples.By the end, you will understand how this powerful tool can enhance your inventory control processes and drive profitability.What Is ABC Analysis in Inventory Management?ABC analysis is a method used in inventory management that classifies items into three categories—A, B, and C—based on their significance to the overall business operations.This classification helps businesses focus their attention on high-value items while streamlining processes for lower-value items.The classification typically follows the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule), which suggests that a small percentage of items (20%) accounts for a large portion (80%) of the total value.Category A: Comprises the most valuable items, often representing 10-20% of total inventory but contributing 70-80% of the overall value.Category B: Includes moderate-value items that account for about 15-25% of total inventory value.Category C: This category consists of low-value items that make up 50-60% of the inventory but contribute only 5-10% to the total value.This systematic approach allows businesses to allocate resources more effectively and maintain optimal stock levels.How Is ABC Analysis Useful in Inventory Management?Implementing ABC analysis in inventory control can yield several advantages: Prioritisation of Resources: By identifying which items are most critical to business success, companies can focus their efforts on managing these high-value stocks more closely.Cost Reduction: Efficiently managing A items reduces carrying costs and minimises waste associated with overstocking or stockouts.Improved Customer Satisfaction: Ensuring that high-demand items are consistently available helps meet customer expectations and enhance service levels.Enhanced Decision-Making: With clear insights into item importance, businesses can make informed decisions regarding purchasing and stocking strategies.The ABC Classification System: Understanding Inventory Categories The ABC classification system is a fundamental component of ABC inventory analysis, designed to optimize inventory management by categorising items based on their importance to the business.This method allows organizations to focus their resources and attention on the most critical inventory items, ensuring efficient stock control and improved operational effectiveness.Categories Explained: In the ABC classification system, inventory items are divided into three distinct categories—A, B, and C—each reflecting the item's contribution to overall inventory value and its significance in the supply chain.Understanding these categories is essential for effective inventory management.CategoryDescriptionPercentage of ItemsPercentage of ValueAHigh-value items requiring tight control10-20%70-80%BModerate-value items with moderate

typically the most valuable to a business, representing a small percentage of total inventory but contributing significantly to overall revenue.These items often require meticulous management due to their high cost and demand variability.Companies should prioritise these items for frequent review and monitoring, ensuring that they are adequately stocked to meet customer demand without incurring excess carrying costs.2.Category B: The Moderate-Value Items Category B items are of moderate value and represent a larger portion of the inventory compared to A items.While they do not require as much attention as A items, they still play a crucial role in the overall inventory strategy.Businesses should implement regular checks on these items to ensure they are replenished appropriately, balancing between availability and cost efficiency.3.Category C: The Low-Value Items Category C encompasses low-value items that comprise the majority of the inventory but contribute minimally to total revenue.While these items require less stringent control, businesses should still monitor them periodically to prevent stockouts or overstock situations.Efficient management of Category C items can free up resources and allow organisations to focus more on higher-value categories.Accurate classification within the ABC system is vital for effective inventory management.Misclassification can lead to inefficient resource allocation, increased carrying costs, and missed sales opportunities.Therefore, businesses must regularly review their classifications based on updated sales data and market trends to ensure that their inventory strategies remain aligned with current demands.How to Calculate ABC Inventory Analysis?Calculating ABC inventory analysis involves determining the annual consumption value for each item using the following formula: Annual Usage Value = Annual Units Sold × Cost per Unit Steps to Calculate: Data Collection: Gather data on each item's sales history and cost.Ranking: Rank all items based on their calculated annual usage value from highest to lowest.Categorisation: Divide the ranked list into A, B, and C categories based on predetermined thresholds.This systematic approach ensures that businesses can accurately classify their inventory according to its importance.Benefits of ABC Analysis in Inventory Management Implementing ABC analysis offers numerous advantages: Cost Reduction: By focusing on high-value A items, businesses can significantly reduce carrying costs associated with overstocking less critical items.This leads to improved cash flow and reduced waste.Improved Control and Efficiency: ABC analysis allows companies to implement tighter controls over high-value items while simplifying processes for lower-value stocks.This results in better resource allocation and streamlined operations.Better Decision-Making: With clear visibility into item importance, businesses can make informed decisions about which products to prioritise when ordering or restocking.This strategic approach minimises stockouts and enhances overall operational efficiency.Increased Customer Satisfaction: By ensuring that critical A category items are always available, businesses can meet customer demand more effectively, leading to enhanced satisfaction and loyalty.Implementing ABC Analysis in Your Business Steps to Implement ABC Analysis To successfully implement ABC analysis in your organisation, follow these key steps: Identify and List Inventory Items: Compile a comprehensive list of all inventory items along with their sales history and costs.Calculate Annual Usage Values: Use the formula provided earlier to determine each item's annual usage value.Rank Items: Rank all items based on their usage values from highest to lowest.Categorise Items: Assign each item to its respective category (A, B, or C) based on its ranking.Regularly reviewing these classifications ensures that they remain relevant as market conditions change.Example of ABC Analysis in Inventory Management To illustrate how ABC analysis works in practice, consider a fictional company, \\\"Sam's Fasteners.\\\"Example Calculation: Item A1:

happy, it's essential to understand Seller-Controlled Return Rate (SCRR) and how it impacts your business.SCRR is a key metric that measures returns that are directly attributed to the seller's actions or issues, such as product defects, incorrect listings, or inadequate packaging.Managing SCRR effectively is crucial to maintaining strong seller performance metrics and eligibility for programs like Amazon Prime or Buy Box placement.What Is SCRR?(Seller-Controlled Return Rate) SCRR, or Seller-Controlled Return Rate, refers to returns that are caused by factors within the seller's control.This includes issues like inaccurate product descriptions, defective products, poor packaging, incorrect items being shipped, or expired goods.A high SCRR can negatively impact your seller performance, leading to account warnings, suspension, or disqualification from programs like Amazon Prime.Reasons for SCRR Classification ReasonDescriptionExampleInaccurate Product DescriptionThe product listing contains incorrect or misleading information, such as wrong dimensions, features, or materials.A seller lists a product as \\\"100% cotton,\\\" but it actually contains synthetic fibers.Defective or Damaged ProductsItems that are shipped in poor condition or are non-functional upon arrival.An electronic gadget is shipped but doesn’t turn on due to a manufacturing defect.Poor

control.However, when returns are classified under SCRR, it can directly impact your eligibility for SAFE-T claims.For example, if the return is due to poor packaging or an inaccurate product description, Amazon may deny your SAFE-T claim, considering it to be the seller's fault.Therefore, managing and minimizing SCRR is key to improving the chances of a successful SAFE-T claim.How to Reduce SCRR ActionDescriptionOptimize Product ListingsEnsure accurate, detailed, and honest descriptions of your products.Include high-quality images and specify dimensions, materials, and features clearly.Quality ControlConduct thorough checks on your inventory before shipping to ensure defect-free and functional products.Improve Packaging StandardsUse robust and secure packaging materials, especially for fragile or perishable items.Fulfill Orders PromptlyMeet shipping timelines consistently and communicate proactively if delays occur.Customer Feedback MonitoringAct on feedback and reviews to identify patterns or recurring issues with specific products.Batch and Expiry ManagementFor consumables, monitor stock closely to avoid sending products nearing expiration.Leveraging WareIQ's Returns QC App To further enhance returns management and reduce SCRR, consider utilizing WareIQ's Returns QC App.This app automates the collection of high-quality visual documentation during the returns process, ensuring compliance with marketplace guidelines and providing robust evidence for claims.By integrating this tool into your operations, you can streamline returns processing,

such as: Customer Change of Mind: The customer changes their mind or finds a better alternative.Product Doesn't Fit or Suit Preferences: Returns due to subjective preferences or size-related issues.Shipping Damage by Carrier: Items damaged during transit by the shipping provider.Incorrect Address Provided by Customer: Delivery issues caused by incorrect shipping information supplied by

Ch...Factors Influencing UPS Servi...Strategies to Reduce UPS Serv...Understanding Accessorial Fee...Negotiating Better Rates with...Common Mistakes in Estimating...Future Trends and Predictions...Conclusion\\nUnderstanding UPS Service Charges\\nUPS service charges can be confusing for both individuals and businesses.These charges vary based on package weight, destination, and additional services required.This article delves into the different types of UPS service charges, how UPS determines these charges, factors that influence them, and offers tips to reduce shipping costs effectively.How UPS Determines Service Charges\\nPackage Weight and Size\\nUPS calculates shipping costs primarily based on the weight and dimensions of the package.Heavier and larger packages incur higher fees due to increased fuel consumption and handling requirements.For accurate pricing, it's crucial to measure and weigh packages precisely.Distance and Destination\\nThe distance a package travels significantly impacts the service charge.Shipping domestically across longer distances, such as from New York to California, costs more than shorter routes, like New York to New Jersey.International shipments also involve additional costs related to customs, duties, and longer transit times.Additional Services\\nUPS offers a range of supplementary services that can affect the total shipping cost.These include:\\nSignature Confirmation: Adds security by requiring a recipient's signature upon delivery.Insurance: Protects against damage or loss during transit.Saturday Delivery: Provides weekend delivery options for an extra fee.Each of these services enhances the shipping experience but comes with additional charges.Factors Influencing UPS Service Charges\\nSeasonal Demand\\nDuring peak seasons, such as the holidays, demand for shipping services increases, leading to surcharges.These surcharges help UPS manage the higher volume and maintain service quality.According to [UPS Seasonal Shipping Rates](https://www.ups.com/us/en/services/seasonal.page), rates can increase by up to 20% during peak periods.Package Characteristics\\nThe nature of the package—whether it's fragile, perishable, or contains hazardous materials—necessitates special handling.UPS imposes additional fees for these specialized services to ensure safety and compliance with regulations.Strategies to Reduce UPS Service Charges\\nEfficient Packaging\\nProperly packing items can significantly reduce shipping costs.Utilizing UPS flat-rate boxes or standard packaging materials ensures optimal weight and size, minimizing extra fees.For more packaging tips, refer to [UPS Packaging Guidelines](https://www.ups.com/us/en/services/shipping/package-options.page).\\nCompare Shipping Carriers\\nBefore finalizing your shipment, compare UPS rates with other carriers like FedEx or USPS.Tools like [Parcel Monkey](https://www.parcelmonkey.com/) allow you to compare rates and choose the most cost-effective option.Schedule Pickups\\nScheduling pickups instead of dropping off packages at UPS locations can save both time and money.UPS often offers discounted rates for scheduled pickups, especially for businesses with regular shipping needs.Utilize Online Tools\\nUsing UPS's online tools for managing shipments and tracking packages helps avoid additional fees associated with incorrect addresses or missed deliveries.The [UPS My Choice](https://www.ups.com/us/en/services/tracking/mychoice.page) service provides enhanced tracking and delivery management features.Understanding Accessorial Fees and Surcharges\\nAccessorial fees are additional charges that UPS applies on top of standard shipping costs.These fees can include:\\nAddress Correction Fees: Charged when the provided delivery address is incorrect or incomplete.Residential Delivery Surcharges: Applied when delivering to a residential address instead of a commercial one.Fuel Surcharges: Adjusted based on current fuel prices and fluctuates accordingly.It's essential to understand these fees to accurately estimate your shipping costs and avoid unexpected expenses.Negotiating Better Rates with UPS\\nBusinesses with high shipping volumes can negotiate favorable rates with UPS.Here are some strategies:\\nLeverage Shipping Volume: Present your shipping data to demonstrate consistent volume, which can qualify you for discounts.Exclusive Use: Using UPS exclusively for shipping needs can enhance your negotiating power.Utilize UPS Tools: Programs like [UPS My Business Solutions](https://www.ups.com/us/en/services/business.page) offer resources to streamline shipping and reduce costs.Regularly reviewing and renegotiating your rates as your business grows ensures you continue to receive the best possible deals.Common Mistakes in Estimating UPS Service Charges\\nMistakes in estimating UPS service charges can lead to unexpected expenses.Common errors include:\\nUnderestimating Package Weight or Size: Inaccurate measurements can result in higher fees or package rejection.Overlooking Additional Fees: Failing to account for accessorial fees can inflate your shipping budget.Ignoring Delivery Time Frames: Selecting an expedited

UPS Service Charges\\nThe shipping industry is evolving, with several trends expected to influence UPS service charges:\\nTechnological Advancements: Automation and AI can enhance efficiency, potentially reducing shipping costs over time.Sustainability Initiatives: Increased demand for eco-friendly shipping options may lead to the introduction of green surcharges, reflecting the cost of sustainable practices.Global Economic Factors: Fluctuations in fuel prices and international trade policies will continue to impact shipping rates.Staying informed about these trends helps businesses anticipate changes and adjust their shipping strategies accordingly.Conclusion\\nUnderstanding UPS service charges is crucial for managing shipping expenses effectively.By recognizing how charges are determined, being aware of influencing factors, and implementing strategies to reduce costs, both individuals and businesses can optimize their shipping practices.Additionally, staying informed about future trends ensures that you remain adaptable in a dynamic shipping landscape.About the Author\\nAnthony Robinson is the CEO of ShipScience, a pioneering company dedicated to helping e-commerce

running a small business, you have to find ways to reduce costs wherever possible.For e-commerce businesses, the cost of shipping your products to customers must be factored into the budget.With customers growing ever-more demanding, you need to offer fast and affordable shipping options—without cutting into your own profits!It’s essential that you partner with the right shipping carrier, as well as considering your packaging and warehouse locations.Contact us today for a customized demo of Brightpearl\\nAnd see how we can help you automate the ordinary and act on the exceptional.Book a demo\\nWe’re going to take you through some effective shipping methods and strategies, and show you ways to reduce costs by finding the right partners and using the best software (like Brightpearl).Basics of Shipping \\nWe’re sure you already know some of this, but it’s worth going over the basics and looking out for ways to keep your shipping costs low.It’s also worth listing all your product weights and sizes, as well as the most common locations for customer orders, so that you have somewhere to start when choosing a carrier.Volume\\nVolume means either the quantity of products you ship, or the size of the individual products.Either way, it’ll make a difference to your costs, so use your sales and customer data to help you predict shipping volume in advance.Small business owners obviously send out fewer packages than large stores, but there are perks to being small.Many shipping services and third-party fulfillment providers offer small business shipping discounts on delivery and packaging.And, as your order volume increases, you can take advantage of bulk rates.Weight\\nThe weight of each package will also affect the price of shipping—including its dimensional weight (DIM).This is a pricing model based on the parcel’s shape and size, as well as its weight, and most major carriers use it to calculate the cost.Typically, large light parcels cost more than smaller, heavier ones.Source: ups.com\\nShipping companies may also offer flat-rate shipping, which is when you’re charged a set price for a shipment, regardless of its actual weight.Flat-rate boxes are usually available for free from the USPS, UPS, or FedEx.Priority\\nAnother cost implication is the priority level.Most carriers have options including standard ground shipping, express, and overnight delivery, and it’s a good idea to offer multiple shipping methods to your own customers.88% of consumers don’t mind paying for faster delivery on urgent orders.Packaging\\nAny packaging adds extra weight, but it’s vital that your products are properly protected.Finding the perfect balance is another thing that small firms have to navigate.You also have to think about sustainability (66% of shoppers say they consider this when making a purchase).If you only sell one type of product, it’s simple to figure out packaging costs, but it’s trickier with a range of different items or one-offs.You may also want to use branded packaging if image is a big part of your business.Delivery Time\\nThe time it takes for a parcel to travel from your facility to the customer will depend on the destination, but also on your shipping carrier and method.If you promise a customer that their order will arrive by a specified time, you need to be sure that it will happen!To provide accurate delivery times, factor in lead times from your supplier and make sure your order fulfillment process is streamlined in order to ship as fast as possible and avoid errors.Destination\\nThe final factor to consider is the destination, and how far away it is from your fulfillment center.The further the parcel has to travel, the more it’ll cost.Shipping carriers divide geographical areas into zones (the US has eight), and you can reduce costs by minimizing the number of zones your shipment travels through.Shipping rates may be different for commercial and residential addresses, and there may be surcharges for weekend or rural delivery.International shipping, of course, is more expensive.Source: nosto.com\\nAutomated order fulfillment with Brightpearl\\nSave 2 months a year vs manual fulfillment\\nBook A Demo\\nShipping Solutions for Small Businesses\\nFrom private carriers like FedEx and DHL to the good old USPS, there are plenty of shipping partners to choose from.And you don’t have to pick just one­—you might find it’s cost-effective to use a private carrier for part of the way, and USPS for last-mile delivery.Alternatively,

rates may be different for commercial and residential addresses, and there may be surcharges for weekend or rural delivery.International shipping, of course, is more expensive.Source: nosto.com\\nAutomated order fulfillment with Brightpearl\\nSave 2 months a year vs manual fulfillment\\nBook A Demo\\nShipping Solutions for Small Businesses\\nFrom private carriers like FedEx and DHL to the good old USPS, there are plenty of shipping partners to choose from.And you don’t have to pick just one­—you might find it’s cost-effective to use a private carrier for part of the way, and USPS for last-mile delivery.Alternatively, you could use a shipping platform like Shipstation or Shiptheory (both of which integrate seamlessly with Brightpearl).You’ll need to do your own comparison based on your specific needs, but here’s a flavor of what the major players offer to small businesses.USPS\\nThe United States Postal Service is often the cheapest option compared to other major carriers, and offers a variety of services for smaller firms including volume discounts and postage calculation tools.The Click-N-Ship feature lets you pay postage and print labels online, and the Pickup service means you don’t have to visit the post office.You can reserve a PO Box so that business mail doesn’t come to your house, and get a free Priority-Mail Starter Kit.USPS also offers cubic pricing, which enables lower rates for items with small shipping volume (under 20lb) through USPS Priority Mail.UPS\\nUPS provides several small business shipping solutions, such as “UPS Connect” which gives you free brainstorming sessions on your business plan and shipping needs.UPS can even help you get discounts for other areas of your business, including accountancy and marketing.There are financial and payment services for managing shipping costs, plus handy services like scheduled pickups and returns management.UPS also has an eFulfillment service to help you store and ship products sold on more than 20 platforms.FedEx\\nFedEx also provides services for small companies, with support such as grants and admin assistance as part of an e-commerce center to help online businesses develop.There’s also a useful FAQs hub and glossary of packaging terminology, plus a dimensional weight calculator.You can schedule pickups, and print custom postcards or coupons to include in parcels.If you sign up for a My FedEx Rewards account, you’ll be rewarded the more you ship.And for perishable items, FedEx offers temperature-controlled shipping packages with cold and heated options.DHL\\nDHL is known for its international delivery services, but that doesn’t rule out small businesses—the carrier aims to help you engage in global trade with a range of services.Fill out a shipping profile on their website and discuss your needs with an expert.DHL Parcel International Standard includes simplified postal customs clearance, reliable transit times and end-to-end tracking, while DHL Express promises delivery by the end of the earliest possible business day.In the US, DHL also partners with the USPS for expedited shipping.Ways to Reduce Shipping Costs\\nNo matter which carrier you use, the cost of shipping will be based on the dimensions and weight of the items, the delivery speed, and the distance between origin and destination.The speed of delivery is your choice (or that of your customers), but there are opportunities to reduce costs for the other aspects.Negotiate\\nDon’t be afraid to negotiate with major carriers—they’re used to it and you may find them more receptive than you think.If you regularly ship large volumes, they’ll be glad of your custom and happy to give you a deal on bulk shipping.And, as we’ve already mentioned, smaller businesses can often enjoy special discounts while they grow.Although sticking with one carrier keeps things simple, it can be more cost-effective to negotiate favorable rates with a number of providers.For example, you could use one firm for local delivery and another for country-wide shipping.Affordable Packaging\\nSource: manufacturinghub.io\\nThe cost of packaging can quickly add up—especially if you don’t pay attention to the weight.Try to use lightweight options such as corrugated boxes, air pillows, packing paper, and bubble wrap.Pack items tightly together if you can, and consolidate orders in one package to use fewer boxes.If all your products are a similar size, you can buy packaging in bulk.You can reuse good-quality boxes and packing material, so don’t throw anything out when a new delivery arrives from your supplier!Outsource Shipping\\nShipping can be a time-consuming task—your business may not have the resources to carry out every task in-house, and you’ll soon run out of space to store your stock.One option is to outsource shipping to a third-party logistics (3PL) provider or a dropshipper.3PL companies are logistics experts and can easily manage shipping and returns on your behalf.They often offer extra services like order management, usually from a network of fulfillment centers.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"z7Br5fY3Y4ytVWp28ZdByAXTk90TJ9FymGmAtSmlyNc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"36b2f462-2b91-43d0-8717-579a35a05706":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"36b2f462-2b91-43d0-8717-579a35a05706\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.brightpearl.com/small-business-shipping-strategies\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"39a93495-f19a-4768-9668-aec58d946d27\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.brightpearl.com/small-business-shipping-strategies\"},\"hash\":\"3Jo3O9LI5aGmQKwRcYMrjjxL+BdUzp21Jf7Zc2esuQY=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a3b2c38a-8f9b-46cd-8b1d-c73e9946162f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.brightpearl.com/small-business-shipping-strategies\"},\"hash\":\"GPZZFi3U4/PY5oEyiwlBLm30gqv6m4Y0yok5P152/AU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"1ea84a3a-2eee-4e92-bad3-d13b42dab0f6\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"qArMRqAL5rWEArsZUVEy2qnH+juGW4n2TNc2W9gD57o=\"}},\"text\":\"Try

offer extra services like order management, usually from a network of fulfillment centers.If you don’t want the whole nine yards, try a hybrid shipping strategy using both in-house and 3PL or dropshipping services.Warehouse Location\\nWhen you’re aiming to reduce the cost of delivery, there’s no point having a warehouse that’s nowhere near your customer base—your parcels would have to travel through multiple zones and you’d have to fork out for expedited delivery on urgent orders.Even for small businesses, it makes sense to own or rent warehouse space in several strategic locations and split your stock between them, so that parcels travel a shorter distance.(If you’re taking the multi-warehouse approach, it’s easy to manage transfers and inventory with Brightpearl.)Qualities of the Right Shipping Partner\\nSource: dtsone.com\\nEvery business has unique needs, so do your research and select a reliable, trustworthy partner who offers all the services you require.Dropshipping\\nA dropshipping partner is a firm that handles your shipping, without you having to store or process any inventory yourself.The dropshipper, usually a manufacturer or wholesaler, ships orders direct to the customer.By cutting out the middleman, dropshipping helps you reduce the costs of storage, transportation, and labor.However, you’re relinquishing control, so make sure your partner shares your commitment to customer service.You could decide to use dropshipping only for your larger products to save on space, and store and ship smaller items yourself.Networking\\nIt’s crucial to choose shipping partners with whom you can build strong relationships and find the right balance of price and convenience.As with all partnerships, good communication is vital—they should be willing to share information so that you know in advance about any supply chain issues.You want to minimize both costs and delivery times, so look for partners in the areas closest to your customer base.As we’ve mentioned, there’s no need to pick just one.You can negotiate deals with several companies, or use existing hybrid arrangements such as FedEx SmartPost and UPS SurePost, both of which hand your package to the USPS for last-mile delivery.Packaging\\nAs well as getting a fair deal on shipping rates, you’ll want to work with a partner who advises you on the best packaging and how to calculate costs.For example, FedEx and UPS use the dimensional pricing model, so you’ll be aware that you need to optimize your packaging to save money.All the major carriers offer flat-rate shipping, where you use carrier-provided, standard packaging.And they usually give you free standard packaging, which is great for small businesses.Even if not all your products will fit into standard boxes, you can save money by using it for some orders.Source: ecwid.com\\nTechnology\\nTechnology makes it much easier to manage the shipping process, so look for a shipping partner who uses advanced tools to track shipments and sync that information with your own business systems.For example, the right software will ensure you receive real-time updates each time a package is dispatched, plus data on its estimated delivery time.If you work with a 3PL, they will have a computer system that streamlines all processes and provides analytics to help you make decisions.How to Charge Your Customers \\nFiguring out how much to charge your customers for shipping is a challenge for small businesses.If you tempt them with free shipping, how will you offset the cost?Is it viable for you to provide next-day or two-day delivery?What about international customers?If your shipping costs are seen as too high, it may cause people to abandon their shopping cart—whereas one study shows that companies can increase orders by 90% by offering free shipping.Whatever you decide to do, it’s important to display your shipping policy clearly on your website.Putting a guarantee on your shipping will reassure your customers that you are able to meet their expectations and will fix any problems that might occur.Free Shipping \\nFree shipping is beloved by all customers.Many people are willing to wait a little longer for non-urgent orders if the delivery is free.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"y/fZNuPKYljE6+hkqLRpo6uw3v+I+YMJhjn88BMNkeI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"1ea84a3a-2eee-4e92-bad3-d13b42dab0f6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1ea84a3a-2eee-4e92-bad3-d13b42dab0f6\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.brightpearl.com/small-business-shipping-strategies\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"39a93495-f19a-4768-9668-aec58d946d27\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.brightpearl.com/small-business-shipping-strategies\"},\"hash\":\"3Jo3O9LI5aGmQKwRcYMrjjxL+BdUzp21Jf7Zc2esuQY=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"36b2f462-2b91-43d0-8717-579a35a05706\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.brightpearl.com/small-business-shipping-strategies\"},\"hash\":\"SH7FyPuBIxyf6OPaF3ZzOw1fj4YoBDjCCnk8ImYDtP4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"f67dcef0-102d-43c1-8595-21137e7486ac\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"j4/p7Rm58cUR6HdYgeGZLC9aWLJPVsJoODZA/Y2+ahE=\"}},\"text\":\"How

your shipping will reassure your customers that you are able to meet their expectations and will fix any problems that might occur.Free Shipping \\nFree shipping is beloved by all customers.Many people are willing to wait a little longer for non-urgent orders if the delivery is free.Often, they’re even prepared to add extra items to their cart just to qualify for free shipping.Source: me.me\\nBut if you offer this option, who’s going to pay for it?You can either pass on the costs to customers by baking it into the price of your products, or agree to bear the cost yourself, which may mean making cuts elsewhere in the business.Look carefully at your budget, sales figures, and customer data to help you decide.You may find it cost-effective to set a minimum order value for free shipping, and promote small add-ons for larger items so that it’s easy for customers to top up the total price.Performing A/B testing will help you understand your customers’ preferences.Flat-rate Shipping\\nFlat-rate shipping is also appealing, because shoppers can order as much as they want without seeing the total rise exponentially as they add to their cart.As well as covering various sizes and weights, a flat rate can also make the cost of long-distance shipping the same as local delivery.If most of your parcels are the same size, and most of your custom comes from a specific region, flat-rate shipping can work well for you.If not, you’ll find yourself shouldering extra costs (or hiking up your product prices).The flat rate should be high enough to cover more expensive deliveries.However, you don’t have to set one flat rate for everything—you can offer a different price for different service levels.And flat-rate shipping helps your business convert variable costs into fixed costs.Real-time Rates\\nFree and flat-rate shipping don’t take into account the fact that carrier rates can fluctuate, based on events in the global supply chain.And while a good shipping partner should update you regularly on price changes, it’s time-consuming to keep changing the information on your website.Another option is to offer real-time rates, which update automatically so that your customers always see the current information.This involves integrating your system with that of your shipping carrier so that the prices are pulled in and displayed on your site at checkout.Shipping Strategies for Small Businesses\\nThere are a number of strategies you can use to optimize shipping, including outsourcing and using specialized software.It’s a good idea to evaluate your shipping strategy regularly to ensure that it’s working for you.Multi-channel\\nToday’s customers demand the convenience and choice of multichannel retail—and the more channels you operate, the more you can sell.This includes your own physical and online stores, e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, or even selling via social media.If you’re selling with a marketplace, make sure you check the criteria carefully to know what you can and can’t sell, as well as any other rules (for instance, you can’t use your own packaging with Amazon).You also need to deliver accurate shipping information, as too many errors can get you kicked off the platform.Fulfilling orders from multiple channels obviously makes your logistics more complex, including returns management.You need to keep a close eye on your inventory and sync data between all channels.Brightpearl helps you do this, as well as setting different shipping methods for different channels.Multi-carrier\\nAs we mentioned earlier, it can be cost-effective to mix and match your shipping partners in order to find the best deals for various package types and destinations.Most small businesses work with two or more carriers for this reason.If you keep an up-to-date record of your product weights, you will find it easier to make comparisons.When it comes to choosing carriers, it’s not just about the lowest rates—look for those offering guaranteed delivery times and robust insurance to cover you for any delays or damage.Evaluate your relationships regularly to make sure everything’s working smoothly, and renegotiate if necessary.Outsource\\nSource: selecthub.com\\nFor small businesses with limited resources, it can make sense to outsource some or all of your operations to a third-party logistics provider.This might be just shipping, or the entire fulfillment process.And it could be for all your products or just some of

your customer experiences.But you’ll also have to give up control, which can be hard when you’ve built the business from scratch.It’s vital that you select a trusted partner, and that you ensure your budget allows for the cost of outsourcing.Shipping Software\\nAs well as finding a carrier who uses the best technology to ensure swift and accurate shipping, your business needs its own software to help you streamline your in-house operations and share critical data with your partners.Look for something that enables you to create smooth workflows using automation, and gives you real-time insights into every corner of the business from inventory to shipping.You could choose a standalone solution, or go for a complete retail operating system that incorporates shipping and fulfillment tools.Optimize Shipping With Brightpearl\\nAs an all-in-one retail operating system, Brightpearl is an affordable way for smaller businesses to get the tools they need—including features designed for a smooth shipping process.Thanks to the powerful Automation Engine, you can save a ton of time on things like creating shipping labels, pick lists, packing slips, and customs forms.You can set the

2019\\nAt the end of every year – like clockwork – major logistics couriers announce rate increases in response to shipping supply and demand, market forces, and rising costs.With eCommerce consistently growing year over year, general rate increase announcements from couriers are now as certain as death and taxes.In this post, we’ll share the current shipping rates and changes for USPS, FedEx, and UPS that eCommerce sellers should be aware of in 2019.2019 USPS Postage Rate Increases\\nPriority Mail saw rates increasing between 3-10%, with smaller packages being affected the most.Priority Mail is the USPS’ core solution for shipping packages domestically, so this change will affect everyone.From January 27, 2019, the rate for a 1 lb Priority Mail package went from $6.70 to $7.35, while the Priority Mail Small Flat Rate Shipping box went from $7.20 to $7.90 – a 9.7% increase for both services.The Medium Flat Rate Shipping Box and Large Flat Rate Shipping Box will see a 5.1% and 5.5% increase, respectively.The dimensional weight (DIM weight) divisor will change from 194 to 166.Changing the divisor to a smaller number means a higher weight per cubic foot will be applied - effectively increasing costs if your shipment is under the dimensional weight.Reducing your parcel size and making sure you have efficient packaging can prevent overpaying on shipping.DIM weight will also be applied to all zones for Priority Mail parcels over 1 cubic foot.Previously, DIM weight was only applied to parcels being shipped to Zones 5-9.This, combined with the reduction of the DIM weight divisor means that small businesses will have to factor in both weight and distance when estimating their shipping costs.Do note that while the rate increases go into effect in January, the DIM weight divisor change and DIM zone changes won’t go into effect until June 23, 2019.First Class Mail will now be priced according to zones.First Class Mail is the solution for packages weighing under 15.99 oz.Previously, rates were dependent on the weight of the item.Now, distance will factor into the rate, meaning it will now cost more to ship these packages over longer distances.Priority Mail International saw average rate increases between 3-5%.USPS’ core solution for shipping packages internationally were not immune to rate increases.However, USPS doesn’t apply additional charges such as fuel and residential delivery like express couriers do, still making it an economical choice for those shipping overseas.{{ compare-the-best-rates-in-seconds }}\\n2019 FedEx Rate Increases\\nFedEx Express and FedEx Ground rates increased an average of 4.9%.This increase is in response to the growth of eCommerce sales and the need to meet ever increasing consumer demands.These rate increases went into effect for US customers on January 7, 2019.Working with a shipping reseller like Easyship can help you access already discounted rates without having to meet volume requirements, allowing your business to offer competitive rates for express shipping options.Certain shipping surcharges and fees have also increased, possibly affecting the total shipping rate.Examples of affected surcharges include:\\nDelivery Area Surcharge - U.S.Express Package Services, FedEx Ground (Residential): increasing from $4 to $4.20, a 5% increase.Residential Delivery Charge - U.S.Express Package Services, U.S.Ground Services, International Ground Service: increasing from $4.15 to $4.40 per package, a 6% increase.Address correction: increasing from $15 to $16 per correction, a 6.6% increase.Reduce cart abandonment by being upfront about your shipping costs with customers.Having consistent messaging throughout your website about additional costs (on your home page, FAQ, and product pages) will prepare customers for what they should expect at checkout.Additionally, ensure you are collecting accurate customer details by having an address verification at checkout.This will reduce the amount of address corrections, and subsequently, failed deliveries.Visit FedEx.com for the complete list of changes.2019 UPS Rate Increases\\nSimilar to FedEx, the rates for UPS® Ground, UPS Air and International services will increase an average net 4.9%.According to UPS, these rate increases are meant to support “ongoing expansion and capability enhancements” and became effective on December 26, 2018.To decide whether UPS is the best solution for your business, you can easily compare rates with other couriers using our Get A Quote feature.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ULUWMLnLuvIOgGwR3rjfIqG8lNMKSO/wpVSCJIxRpnY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c770217a-5040-4760-8c64-6155ab65a5d3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c770217a-5040-4760-8c64-6155ab65a5d3\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.easyship.com/blog/shipping-rate-increases\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"e8c31476-1bd9-4ba9-bfd7-f3752ee7ef30\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.easyship.com/blog/shipping-rate-increases\"},\"hash\":\"26Q/KMVl/xFsws89qDIoFPOwbTdwkJWferGshJf8RTE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"60b0d43c-1599-4296-8baf-4d1c042f0fc4\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.easyship.com/blog/shipping-rate-increases\"},\"hash\":\"ULUWMLnLuvIOgGwR3rjfIqG8lNMKSO/wpVSCJIxRpnY=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"2c3a3094-219c-4ef5-b7ae-7a492a1755a2\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"ajmowTsfzm3KIWcEltkfJinoKqjlaaPBSNzDyH9442E=\"}},\"text\":\"Address

Price and adjusted weekly.Fuel surcharges are unavoidable when using an express courier.Read our blog post on other hidden fees you may not be aware of when shipping.The rates for certain value-added services and other charges will increase.Examples of affected surcharges include:\\nThe additional handling fee for packages over 70 lbs in actual weight will increase $4.The Hazardous Materials (dangerous goods) charge for domestic UPS® Ground Services will increase $2.00.The Residential Surcharge for domestic UPS® Ground Service, UPS® Standard to/from Canada and UPS® Standard to/from Mexico shipments will increase $0.35.Visit ups.com for the complete list of changes.Preparing your business for shipping GRI’s\\nWork with multiple couriers.By using a mix of postal, regional, and express couriers, you have a better chance of getting the best rates for every major destination.An additional benefit is the opportunity to provide more delivery choices to your customers.Easily compare rates between multiple couriers by using our Get A Quote feature.Re-think your free shipping policy.With economical couriers like USPS raising rates to maintain revenues, some small businesses may find it harder to completely cover the costs of free shipping.Consider restricting free shipping to local destinations or refrain offering it year-round.Work with a reseller for additional discounted rates.If you’re worried that your current shipping volume won’t qualify your business for additional discounts with major couriers, consider working with a company like Easyship.One account will give you access to over 250+ shipping solutions that are discounted up to 70% off retail prices.By using a shipping software like Easyship, you can also keep track of your shipping costs all in one place, allowing you to easily analyze your spending and help navigate future GRI’s.Conclusion\\nWith the volume of eCommerce packages increasing each year, couriers have no choice but to implement general rate increases to be able to process these additional volumes while continuing to uphold demanding customer standards.As these increases are announced at the end of every year and usually implemented at the beginning of the next year, small businesses should take this opportunity to examine their shipping costs and make adjustments to ensure their shipping strategy is optimized.JUMP TO
