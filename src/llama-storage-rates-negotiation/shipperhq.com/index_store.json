the second largest expense for online retailers and can make up as much as 70% of a company’s total fulfillment costs.As online shopping continues to explode, so does the need for efficient and cost-effective shipping strategies.One critical aspect of this is understanding and calculating dimensional weight.If you’re not familiar with the term, you’re not alone — but understanding dimensional shipping can save your business significant money and headaches.In this blog, we’ll dive into what dimensional weight is, why it matters, and how you can calculate it accurately to optimize your shipping strategy.What is Dimensional Weight?Dimensional weight, also known as volumetric weight, is a pricing technique shipping carriers use to account for the amount of space a package occupies, rather than just its actual weight.This concept is especially important when shipping lightweight, bulky items that take up more space in a delivery vehicle than a heavier, compact item.Carriers use it to ensure that shipping costs reflect the volume of space a package requires, thereby optimizing their capacity and efficiency.For online businesses, understanding how to calculate and manage dimensional weight is crucial to avoid unexpected shipping costs and to provide accurate pricing to customers at checkout.How Dimensional Weight Rating Work?Carriers like UPS, FedEx, DHL, and others rate packages by a combination of factors.Aside from distance, the most significant is weight.However, they do not use actual package weight for all shipments but rather the greater of actual weight, also called dead weight, and dimensional weight.Dimensional weight has a significant impact on your shipping costs.With the rise of free shipping expectations among consumers, retailers often struggle to balance competitive pricing with maintaining profitability.Calculating dimensional weight helps businesses understand their shipping expenses better and offers an opportunity to adjust packaging strategies, negotiate better rates, and improve overall cost efficiency.Calculating Dimensional Weight\nThe formula to calculate dimensional weight varies slightly depending on the carrier and the unit of measurement used.However, the basic formula is:\nDimensional Weight = (Length x Width x Height) ÷ Dimensional Factor\nUnderstanding the Components\nLength, Width, Height: Measure the package dimensions in inches or centimeters.It’s important to use the longest points for each dimension, including any protrusions.Dimensional Factor: This is a standard number set by carriers that converts the volume of a package into its dimensional weight.Common dimensional factors are:\n139 for domestic shipments in the US (inches/pound)\n166 for international shipments (inches/pound)\n5000 for metric calculations (centimeters/kilogram)\nExample Calculation:\nImagine you’re shipping a package with the following dimensions: 20 inches long, 15 inches wide, and 10 inches high.For a domestic shipment in the US:\nDimensional Weight = (20 x 15x 10) ÷ 139 = 21.6 pounds\nAlways round up to the nearest whole number, so the dimensional weight would be 22 pounds.If the actual weight of the package is less than 22 pounds, carriers will charge based on the dimensional shipping.Can Dimensional Packing Solutions Reduce Shipping Costs?A dimensional packing solution becomes essential for optimizing packaging to reduce dimensional weight and lower shipping costs.By selecting the right packaging for each order, you can reduce void fill, prevent damage during transit, and improve customer satisfaction.ShipperHQ offers a robust dimensional packing solution as part of its shipping management platform.It helps you automatically determine the best packing configuration for any combination of products in the cart.You can also create packing rules to process specific products differently based on unique conditions that you designate.Sign up for a

when e-commerce sellers expand past a single fulfillment location.However, the right tools can make all the difference in creating strategic, efficient processes that make shipping from multiple warehouses smooth and automated.Multi-origin shipping – it sounds a bit complicated, but in reality, it’s simple.It’s the practice of fulfilling shipments from more than one location.When a retailer stores their inventory across multiple locations, the most efficient way to fulfill orders is to ship them from the location closest to the customer.In addition, some orders may include items stored at different warehouses, meaning products from the same order may be better off shipping separately.However, there may be scenarios in which shipping all items from the same warehouse is more efficient, even if it’s not the one closest to the customer.Of course, creating shipments from multiple warehouses, determining where stock is located, and nitty-gritty details can get complicated.For a rapidly scaling business, the manual labor involved in directing shipments from several locations would be a serious time-suck.The good news?ShipperHQ’s Multi-Origin Shipping tool was designed specifically for this purpose.It allows retailers to create custom shipping rules that dictate where items ship from, how multiple shipments are handled, and more.What’s Multi-Origin Shipping Used For?Any retailer that has multiple fulfillment locations can benefit from this ShipperHQ feature.Most often, fulfillment locations are simply warehouses where inventory lives.But sometimes, they can be brick-and-mortar retail stores across the country.Retailers who use dropshipping can benefit from Multi-Origin Shipping.The tool aggregates shipping rates from multiple drop-ship locations into a single rate.Retailers who use drop shippers never handle any inventory.Everything is stored at a dropshipping location, which ships items directly to customers.Some merchants use dropshipping exclusively, while others use it to supplement their catalog without handling the extra merchandise.What Are the Benefits of Multi-Origin Shipping?The key reason people use Multi-Origin Shipping is to save money.When merchants fulfill out of multiple warehouses, they often need to send different parts of an order from different locations.Because of this, they end up paying for multiple shipments while the customer only pays for one.Let’s take a look at an example: Sarah’s Sock Company has several fulfillment locations.However, its core location in Austin, Texas, holds the entire inventory of socks.Another location in L.A.holds all the company’s masks.A third location, a drop shipper, ships shoes out of Chicago.While the warehouses may share some inventory, socks typically ship from Austin, and masks from L.A.Because the company does not hold any inventory for the shoes they have, those products must always be shipped from Chicago.If a customer were to place an order, including a pack of socks, shoes, and a mask, Sarah’s Sock Company would need to pay to have all three items shipped to the customer separately.Meanwhile, the customer would have only paid a portion of the shipping cost.Some companies can subsidize shipments in this way, but most cannot afford to.With Multi-Origin Shipping configured, Sarah’s Socks could charge the customer a single rate that includes shipping costs for all three items.Retailers who sell on a dropshipping model, whether partially or exclusively, can also benefit from the tool.Because many companies use dropshipping for only some items,  it can be tricky to calculate shipping rates that include shipping costs from these locations.However, the Multi-Origin Shipping feature allows retailers to ship orders that include products from a warehouse and a dropshipper using a single, accurate shipping rate.How Does It Work?There are a few ways you can choose to configure this Advanced Feature.The right one depends on your business objectives and how you handle fulfillment.Ship from the nearest origin: Choose this option if you want products to be sent to customers from the closest location that has the required inventory.Ship from the fewest origins: Choose this option if you want to ship products from the origin with more items from the order.There’s no right option here – some scenarios make shipping from the closest location more efficient, while others mean shipping from one location is smarter.Consider this: a customer places an order to Sarah’s Socks which includes a mask and a pair of socks.The customer is based in Dallas.While the Austin warehouse does have the inventory for the socks they’ve ordered, they don’t have the mask.Instead, the L.A.warehouse has both items in stock.Instead of shipping the socks and masks separately, they may opt to “ship from the fewest origins.”This means that the entire shipment would come from L.A.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"WixqHct9pU3Mw+yzbYYaPRpxb0qo72Z5k5OGZWaYnLo="},"915733f8-635e-48fa-8bf2-45ab225d0ceb":{"id_":"915733f8-635e-48fa-8bf2-45ab225d0ceb","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shipperhq.com/2021/04/muilti-origin-shipping-101"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"2f61bdff-c8db-4192-8bc8-ccfdd7707690","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shipperhq.com/2021/04/muilti-origin-shipping-101"},"hash":"WKq8llMlI5EjwQzCuZyFnrvNY7emNU6p6bzI78OmMCo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"66e25093-96ab-4b9d-992b-5c6442c76bf3","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shipperhq.com/2021/04/muilti-origin-shipping-101"},"hash":"WixqHct9pU3Mw+yzbYYaPRpxb0qo72Z5k5OGZWaYnLo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"239f75d1-d791-41ea-8681-e050b4e767bb","metadata":{},"hash":"yao7vTGT9tlQKIZS7PO9s5P0N+k2L3BGH6+KBwIjiO8="}},"text":"The

items in stock.Instead of shipping the socks and masks separately, they may opt to “ship from the fewest origins.”This means that the entire shipment would come from L.A., condensing what could have been separate shipments into one.This makes shipping cheaper for the customer, and the company doesn’t have to eat any of the cost.Restricting Shipments by Origin\nAnother key feature of Multi-Origin Shipping is the ability to restrict a shipment’s origin based on location.For example, if Sarah’s Socks eventually opens up a Toronto warehouse, they want to be sure that orders from the Northeastern U.S.don’t ship from this location.Shipping cross-border often requires additional paperwork, taxes, and restrictions – even for orders from the U.S.to Canada.The sock company might restrict products from shipping from Canada if they’re headed for a U.S.address to avoid this.Increasingly, companies are opening warehouses in multiple locations to avoid these cross-border complications.With Brexit in full effect, many brands choose to open fulfillment centers within the U.K.This allows them to continue selling there without complications.For scenarios like these, a tool like Multi-Origin Shipping is crucial.The ShipperHQ Method:\nDistilling complicated shipping scenarios into straightforward customer experiences is what we do.Let’s explore how ShipperHQ’s shipping logic works for Multi-Origin Shipping:\nAfter you’ve configured inventory and warehouse information, ShipperHQ uses its shipping logic and your origin information to decide which shipping location should be used\nIf products need to ship from different origins, ShipperHQ will calculate rates for each separate shipment.ShipperHQ displays the rates and methods that suit your preferences and settings.If shipments are coming from multiple locations, they must have a shipping method in common to pull in a single rate.If they don’t share a common method, you can use Method Merging to create one.Configuring the feature in ShipperHQ ensures that all products can be combined to create an accurate shipping rate, even without an existing common method.Merchants can choose to name the newly created method whatever they like to ensure clarity at checkout.If Sarah’s Sock Company uses FedEx for shipments from L.A., UPS for Austin, and USPS for Chicago, their order may come from three different carriers.However, the customer will still only see a single rate with Method Merging.Product Attributes \nAfter configuring Multi-Origin Shipping, you’ll see an additional attribute option for your products within your platform.The Origin Attribute allows you to assign a specific origin to any product.For Sarah’s Socks, that might mean adding an Austin Origin Attribute to its signature socks line and an L.A.one for masks that are only stored in that warehouse.All shoes would carry a Chicago Origin Attribute since it’s the only place they’re stored.The Integration of Shopify and ShipperHQ’s Multi-Origin Shipping Function\nFor those operating their e-commerce outlets on Shopify, the platform’s multi-origin shipping function is valuable, facilitating a seamless and more efficient fulfillment process.Shopify’s feature lets sellers define multiple shipping origins, like stores or warehouses.Once an order is received, Shopify’s smart system determines the fulfillment center nearest to the customer and automatically assigns the order for fulfillment from that location.This feature becomes incredibly useful for Shopify merchants managing inventory across various locations.It assists in reducing shipping durations and costs, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction.Setting up and managing Shopify’s multi-origin shipping feature is straightforward.Sellers can establish locations in Shopify’s shipping settings, allocate inventory to each spot, and even configure rules to prioritize specific locations as needed.Moreover, Shopify’s multi-origin shipping function works harmoniously with other Shopify capabilities, such as Shopify Shipping, which offers discounted rates with major shipping carriers.As a result, merchants gain an integrated, cost-effective solution for handling multi-origin shipping.Despite the potential complexities of managing orders from multiple locations, Shopify’s multi-origin shipping function makes the procedure simple and efficient.But what if you want to leverage the power of ShipperHQ’s advanced features on your Shopify

fulfillment.In the early days, the company shipped all products from one location.The logistics around sending ice cream on full cross-country trips were laden with potential issues.“We were opening Scoop Shops across the country, but only shipping out of one fulfillment center,” said Clements.“We realized that to sustain our online business and cold storage supply chain, we needed multi-warehouse fulfillment.This wasn’t native to our platform Bigcommerce, so we knew we needed a solution,” said Chelsea Clements, former Director of Ecommerce at Jeni’s.After integrating with ShipperHQ, fulfillment became streamlined and automated.Soon after the integration, disasters in California made it impossible to ship out of key fulfillment centers.“ShipperHQ helped us enable multi-warehouse fulfillment logic for our BigCommerce store, which grew the business.This especially came in handy during a time of crisis when landslides in California prevented us from getting shipments out of one of our fulfillment centers,” Clements said.“If that had happened before we used ShipperHQ, we would have had to shut down our entire e-commerce business until the roads re-opened.We don’t have any developers on the team, but with ShipperHQ, it was as easy as changing some settings, and we could keep our business up and running.”Thanks to Multi-Origin Shipping, the business remained intact during a natural disaster, and happy customers received their tasty treats in tip-top condition.How Can Multi-Origin Shipping Help My Business?More than anything, ShipperHQ’s Multi-Origin Shipping feature can save you money.When shipments are being sent from multiple locations but not being charged as such, retailers lose money.Charging accurate shipping rates to your customers can eliminate these shortcomings, seriously helping your bottom line.In addition, Multi-Origin Shipping makes handling multiple warehouses much simpler through automation.Plus, with Method Merging enabled, you can use separate carriers or methods for every warehouse.Different service and pricing levels of certain carriers in certain areas can significantly impact the rates you pay for shipping.The tool makes scaling your business more realistic.If you move to multiple warehouse fulfillment and continue handling fulfillment manually, you’ll spend a lot of time and effort coordinating operations.If you expand further, the scale of this work will grow exponentially.Adding locations can be a breeze when you know fulfillment will be smooth, predictable, and accurate.FAQs\nHow does multi-origin shipping reduce shipping costs?By shipping products from the closest warehouse to the customer, multi-origin shipping cuts down on distance-related shipping fees.It also allows for consolidation of items, reducing costs further when multiple items in an order are fulfilled from the same location.How does multi-origin shipping affect the return process for customers?Multi-origin shipping can expedite the return process, as customers typically send back items to the nearest fulfillment center, cutting down on return shipping costs.However, clear communication about return locations is essential.What challenges might a business face when implementing multi-origin shipping?Challenges include complex inventory management across multiple locations, dealing with different shipping carriers and rates, and handling regulatory or tax differences between various locations.Can multi-origin shipping be combined with dropshipping or third-party logistics solutions?Yes, each supplier or logistics provider acts as an additional shipping origin in dropshipping or third-party logistics models.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XAKybE5zAAAGhg6HptXxOHAXUE5lHL3GzUHe2F7CIUo="},"39913832-9776-40d2-91f5-5704f5032096":{"id_":"39913832-9776-40d2-91f5-5704f5032096","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shipperhq.com/2021/04/muilti-origin-shipping-101"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"2f61bdff-c8db-4192-8bc8-ccfdd7707690","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shipperhq.com/2021/04/muilti-origin-shipping-101"},"hash":"WKq8llMlI5EjwQzCuZyFnrvNY7emNU6p6bzI78OmMCo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"239f75d1-d791-41ea-8681-e050b4e767bb","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shipperhq.com/2021/04/muilti-origin-shipping-101"},"hash":"yao7vTGT9tlQKIZS7PO9s5P0N+k2L3BGH6+KBwIjiO8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"71e8dd21-7c79-4f7d-896a-d21479621d4e","metadata":{},"hash":"lGSNHo0zvcm+ijYN3yqeZXQ3emV+1NzeSagkIOoZLDI="}},"text":"FAQs\nHow

Checkout Optimization\nShipperHQ helps Shopify Plus merchants turn their shipping strategy into a smart, scalable revenue stream to drive sales\nAustin, TX (PRWEB) - ShipperHQ, the #1 shipping rate management solution for ecommerce retailers, today announced its selection into the Shopify Plus Certified App Program.\nAs the first Shopify Plus app partner that handles the pre-purchase shipping experience, merchants using ShipperHQ can take control of their online shipping strategy and present a checkout experience that aligns with their unique products and customers.\nAfter installation, retailers can tailor the information that appears at checkout to a buyer’s exact purchasing scenario, considering what’s in a customer’s cart, where they are located, how much they’re spending and more.\n“Once a customer is ready to make a purchase, one of the last impressions they have of you is your shipping. It’s a make or break experience for most people,” said Quentin Montalto, COO of ShipperHQ.\n“It’s more than simply doing what your customer wants, which is always offering fast and inexpensive shipping options. You need to consider how you actually run your business, like what boxes you use, the carriers you work with and where you ship orders from. With ShipperHQ, Shopify Plus merchants will be able to take all of these things into account and build a strategy that works for them.”\nWith ShipperHQ’s shipping app for Shopify Plus, B2B and B2C merchants configure a long-term shipping strategy that ties to their exact business goals, whether it's increasing conversions, breaking even on shipping or generating a profit from it. Through ShipperHQ’s advanced features, retailers can:\nShow details customers expect to see at checkout, such as accurate delivery dates\nCustomize delivery options offered to buyers, including store pickup and LTL freight\nImprove shipping margins by automating rates from multiple shipping origins\nDetermine how boxes are selected for orders and how products are packed together\nSave money by checking a customer’s address type to get charged the correct fees\nPrior to this official collaboration, ShipperHQ has worked with tens of thousands of merchants since the company’s launch in 2014 including many established Shopify Plus stores like Tecovas, Zippo and Igloo.\n“To be successful during this pivotal time, online retailers must partner with technology solutions that can take their changing requirements and scale with them. That’s why being named the first shipping app into the Shopify Plus Certified App Program is so exciting,” said Karen Baker, CEO of ShipperHQ.\n“We work with many merchants that have gone through this type of transition period, and are still with us today. One reason why they’ve stuck around is that to us the most important thing is the merchant and what they need to keep their business alive and thriving for as long as possible. I know the Shopify Plus team shares this sentiment and that this program is designed to guide merchants as their needs become more complex.”\nAbout ShipperHQ\nShipperHQ is a Shipping Rate Management solution that helps merchants align their checkout to the way they do business through shipping rules, restrictions, discounts and surcharges. ShipperHQ also allows merchants to define shipping rates and delivery options by weight, product type and more. With these tools, retailers can dynamically tailor the shipping rates and options that appear to every specific buying scenario. Direct integrations let retailers account for factors like specific items in the cart, customer location, cart size and more. With 50+ small package and LTL freight carriers, live-rates show every time and provide customers with the most accurate shipping prices possible.\nTo learn more about ShipperHQ visit: http://www.ShipperHQ.com\nSource: PRWeb\nView original release here: https://www.prweb.com/releases/shipperhq_joins_the_shopify_plus_certified_app_program_as_the_first_shipping_partner_focused_on_checkout_optimization/prweb17438073.htm\nLike what you are reading?\nSign up for our free newsletter\nSIGN ME UP\nNewsletter Signup\nSIGN ME UP\nThis website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
