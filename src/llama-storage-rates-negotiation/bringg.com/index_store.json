business’s profit depends on more than just how much you sell—shipping costs and delivery efficiency also impact your bottom line.With the e-commerce industry continuing to grow, it’s essential to stay competitive, offer a top-notch service, and keep your loyal customers satisfied, all while avoiding fluctuating shipping rates.In this article, we offer 11 tips to slash shipping costs, grow your margins, and speed up delivery.Luckily, if you’re trying to lower shipping costs, there are plenty of options.Leverage negotiation power \nThe power of negotiation factors into most business deals, and shipping is no exception.While you may have an agreement with one carrier, it can be worth branching out to see what others offer—either to jump ship or use as a bargaining chip to lock in a more competitive rate.Tip: Since carriers tend to increase their rates frequently, it’s important to stay on top of current tariffs to avoid overpaying unnecessarily.Rely on a Delivery Management Platform \nOne of the best ways to save money, not only on shipping but on other aspects of your business, like staffing and fleet management, is by leveraging a Delivery Management Platform (DMP).DMPs offer automation, real-time updates, and tracking, streamlining the entire process from checkout to delivery.Plus, data analytics features provide insight into opportunities to optimize your shipping processes and costs.Invest in route optimization software\nA surefire way to decrease shipping costs is to optimize the delivery route itself.Many DMPs include route optimization software to find the most efficient path and avoid congestion.This cuts costs by saving money on fuel and drive time and enables your workforce to focus on other tasks.Be smart about tracking inventory\nInventory management systems keep track of exactly what you have in stock and where.This information prevents financial losses from accidental overstocking, as well as stockouts, which can lead to rush shipping fees to fulfill orders, putting you at risk of missing your goals for on-time delivery.DMPs can integrate with your inventory management system, which keeps everything streamlined and ensures every system has accurate information.Switch to just in time delivery\nAlternatively, use a “just in time” inventory process.This means placing an order with your supplier only when you require the goods, which removes warehouse and inventory costs.However, just in time delivery requires you to be on top of demand forecasting, as it’s important to know exactly what inventory you need and when.Maximize your warehouse space\nWhile it’s likely you’ll need to store inventory most of the time, you can do it smartly.Organize your warehouse to get the most out of the space available and avoid the need for additional storage facilities.This helps reduce shipping costs since you’ll send everything from one location instead of dealing with variable costs from multiple places.For example, assess how your space is used currently.See if you can reorganize by storing items based on size and get rid of any old inventory you won’t sell.You can even reduce the width of aisles or other empty spaces to create more room for stock.Consider dropshipping \nDropshipping is the practice of shipping goods directly from the supplier to the customer, rather than involving your business.It can save money on storage and remove the cost of shipping to and from your warehouse.Some studies have shown it’s possible to increase profits by 18.33% with dropshipping as opposed to selling products on your own.This is due to fewer costs for storage, packaging, and more.Optimize packaging \nEfficient packaging can reduce the cost of materials and shipping.Smaller, lower-weight packages also cost less to ship, allowing carriers to transport more at once.Such packaging improvements are attractive to sustainability-minded customers who appreciate environmentally friendly shipping.According to a case study by McKinsey, one supplier eliminated customized packaging and replaced it with collapsible packages that were transferred to and from local locations by a third-party vendor, thus reducing costs and packaging emissions by 50%.Get bulk discounts by consolidating shipments\nMany carriers charge by volume, meaning the more you ship, the less it costs per shipment.It’s important to note that carriers often provide discounts for bulk shipments.By combining multiple shipments into fewer packages, you may qualify for a bulk discount that helps you pay less in shipping costs per item.Provide flexible delivery options\nCustomers appreciate having the ability to choose what’s most cost-effective for their needs—for example, a choice of standard or expedited shipping.If customers frequently choose the lower-cost option, it’ll help reduce shipping expenses.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ncik4WUgQCW10NXjxNjkaoohbMLp6Ngz89WpJbGpXlM="},"8233b291-e4e3-45bb-9a6c-41a1fd046aec":{"id_":"8233b291-e4e3-45bb-9a6c-41a1fd046aec","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/reduce-shipping-costs-increase-margins/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"3e86117e-4cb6-4a35-ad11-07c67a6a4de5","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/reduce-shipping-costs-increase-margins/"},"hash":"XlWZ2wF8h7ADnTC6uAIuoptMJOnc5EAYVdTz2ute1Gk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fc007f60-b61d-4aae-88ff-890be590223f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/reduce-shipping-costs-increase-margins/"},"hash":"ncik4WUgQCW10NXjxNjkaoohbMLp6Ngz89WpJbGpXlM="}},"text":"Smaller,

experience and return again, which is key in last mile delivery.Offer pickup or delivery to locals\nIf you’re trying to provide an on-demand delivery experience, a quick option is to offer local customers the ability to pick up their goods directly or deliver them to a nearby specified drop-off.Offering local delivery lets you avoid paying a carrier.If customers pick up directly, you won’t even incur shipping costs.Conclusion\nCutting shipping costs can skyrocket your profit, and there are plenty of ways to do it—whether your focus is on negotiating discounts or better rates, leveraging DMPs for route optimization and inventory management, or changing how you store and package your goods.Bringg’s all-in-one delivery platform offers route optimization, inventory management integration, real-time delivery tracking, and more to streamline operations and reduce shipping costs.Latest Bringg Updates\nDelivery\nOptimizing Big & Bulky eCommerce: Peak Season Strategies for

eCommerce eruption of the last few years, a great deal of focus has been placed on last mile delivery.Shippers and logistics providers are reacting to the changing face of consumer expectations for speed, visibility and convenience in the last mile by investing in real-time tracking and more convenient order fulfillment.Yet despite its similarities with the last mile of delivery, first mile delivery isn’t getting as much attention or resources invested in improving efficiency and visibility.And even less thought has been given to improving the first mile delivery experience and the wider impact that this can have on the overall business.This article looks at how last mile delivery solutions can be applied to the first mile, in order to improve service to shippers and boost efficiency across the supply chain process.What is first mile delivery?First mile delivery refers to the transportation of goods across the first leg of the supply chain.But the first mile could mean different things for different supply chains and industries.For a retailer, this could be delivering items from a regional warehouse to a local distribution center or local stores.For a logistics service provider, this could be a service of picking up goods, and either:\nBringing them back to their own warehouse or station (i.e. the next day/distribution model) before shipping them to the final destination, or \nA same day or on-demand service where the LSPs pick up the order from the shipper, which then go out for delivery to the consignee\nFor a moving and storage company, for example, the first mile would involve a pickup from the customer’s home or store, and bringing the inventory back to the warehouse or storage site.The same applies with picking up eCommerce shipments and taking them to a distribution center for the next leg of delivery.In both cases, it involves loading and unloading shipments multiple times.It can involve different drivers managing the same items, items with more than one order ID (which is often resolved manually by many 3pls), and, in the case of LTL freight, shipments from multiple retailers and ecommerce shippers.Many ecommerce marketplaces and merchants with an online presence, often dealing with parcel shipping, prefer to send their own truck loads to the 3pl’s warehouse, effectively covering the first mile of the delivery process on their own.However, as eCommerce shipments pile up and merchants find themselves rejected by their regular, overwhelmed logistics providers, covering the first mile presents logistics providers with a chance to provide competitive, premium services to more retailers.First mile delivery challenges \nFirst mile delivery is a complex step in the supply chain process.There are many challenges, but we’ll focus on three primary ones:\nLack of focus on first mile experience.Shippers expect a great experience from their personal deliveries – so why not give them the same treatment when their business orders are shipped?Thanks to the boom in eCommerce and deliveries directly to consumer’s homes, businesses have been paying close attention to the last mile in recent years.Facing fierce competition online, businesses rushed to improve and expand their fulfillment services, overhauling outdated last mile delivery processes.In parallel, nothing moved in the first mile world.The first mile has been largely ignored from the perspective of the delivery experience – in part because there are fewer businesses involved in the first mile than there are customers in last mile delivery.However, every aspect of the delivery experience plays a part in creating customer stickiness.B2B shippers are also B2C consumers, who order online and get products shipped to their homes.They receive great delivery experiences with their personal deliveries – so why not give them that same level of service when their business orders are shipped?What’s preventing logistics providers from arranging this?A great customer experience comes down to two things: visibility, choice, and feedback.These three things help businesses gain a customer’s trust, and make them feel that they are at the heart of the logistics process (which they should be!).The first challenge most businesses face is to convince key stakeholders that the same rules apply as in the last mile: the customer experience must be at the center of operations.Digitization – For many, first mile delivery is a highly manual process – full of phone calls, pen-and-paper tracking, and two-hour time slots.Shippers don’t have options for different times of day – someone needs to stick around for the provider’s truck to come and haul away goods, without any real-time visibility or any predictability as to when the provider will arrive.These processes can be improved by digitizing the first mile delivery flow.Large companies have technology for optimizing first mile logistics, but may not have the technology to manage  the ‘shipping’ experience.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XIqFjAakxxLRLLBlpkwcq6aYG2svmLhKrLHchCklV4I="},"e30ea8dd-9041-4add-8c5b-66e4b8235a0b":{"id_":"e30ea8dd-9041-4add-8c5b-66e4b8235a0b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/logistics/first-mile-delivery/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0e40c8e2-aac6-4bfe-842c-eb36d2ca0477","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/logistics/first-mile-delivery/"},"hash":"3Qb5fd5gZFBaU+NG3HiPeT+sU37MUkNCVqokyMFWRtc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ae1f3411-fa2a-47d3-9133-12c82a865361","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/logistics/first-mile-delivery/"},"hash":"XIqFjAakxxLRLLBlpkwcq6aYG2svmLhKrLHchCklV4I="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"bc6a3d88-fb57-42d6-bb83-caabb571e32e","metadata":{},"hash":"L8bXEMWCTZ02d//J0DE9ig1buo/pccOZ2YXhw6Gpt9I="}},"text":"A

arrive.These processes can be improved by digitizing the first mile delivery flow.Large companies have technology for optimizing first mile logistics, but may not have the technology to manage  the ‘shipping’ experience.Small companies, on the other hand, may need to do a larger transformational process, taking their entire supply chain from manual to efficient digital operations.This can take a great deal of time and more resources than are available.Visibility.For most shippers, once a provider takes a truckload from its warehouse, there is zero visibility into where the order is.This is particularly problematic for shippers of big and bulky goods, or fragile or expensive items.When these items get lost or delayed in transit, there’s a lot at stake, not the least of which is a delayed customer and reduced satisfaction with your fulfillment service.What is first mile tracking?First mile tracking refers to tracking the status and location of orders from the retailer or manufacturer’s warehouse to a distribution center, or to one of the retailer’s local fulfillment centers.For logistics providers, this can be the transfer of products from a retailer’s distribution center to the provider’s own warehouse, prior to final mile delivery.Tracking and visibility is one example of how the last mile delivery experience starts with the first mile of delivery.To offer competitive services to shippers, it’s important to look at the delivery experience from the shipper’s perspective as well as the end customer’s, starting with the first mile.Today, it’s possible to update your first mile shipping and first mile delivery experience using many of the same techniques that are applied to last mile delivery.Integrated first mile, last mile delivery systems\nIt is impossible to create flexibility in the first mile in real time, and at scale, without automated systems.In the first mile flow, everything from route planning to sorting and staging can be managed digitally and automated for better reporting, visibility, and shipper experience.Just as importantly, automation will reduce the time and resources necessary to get goods across the first mile.So many processes, from tracking, to communications, to notifications and alerts can be automated.Today, you can even speed up transitions by automating the loading and staging processes.That will allow providers to deliver more with the existing resources, or free up capacity to take on more shippers – at a time when delivery capacity is in particularly short supply.Much of the technology for last mile delivery optimization – such as dispatch and routing software, automated customer notifications and real-time tracking – can be applied to boost efficiency around the first mile and turn it into a key selling point for potential shippers.Looking for more best practices?Read our Guide to eCommerce Delivery Logistics\nSpeed – Shortening the time to warehouse creates efficiencies and price savings for the logistics provider, while ensuring that you can offer premium service plans to shippers and the end user.This can be through\nIntelligent dispatch and routing\nOrder batching or automated task consideration\nEnabling simultaneous reverse logistics and regular logistics flow.Being able to manage pickup and dropoff flows along the same route both opens opportunities for services like recycling old products, and managing multiple shipments for moving companies.It also helps optimize for less-than-truckload (LTL) runs.Enabling Flexibility and convenience\nThe ability to offer a greater variety of services to shippers – such as both planned and on-demand first mile delivery –  can be a gamechanger, just as it is for providers offering it in the last mile.Another way to increase flexibility for retailers and ecommerce companies would be to provide shorter, more flexible pickup windows.For example, instead arriving in the evening at inconvenient hours, providers could offer multiple delivery windows based on real-time availability.Real-time operational visibility – Visibility across supply chain journey includes: \nReal time tracking – Retailers are the first mile equivalent of the end customer in the last mile: they want to know where their shipments are at all times.For transportation of goods that are expensive or fragile, or white glove deliveries, in particular, retailers are particularly wary about losing track of goods or having them damaged.Yet not many transportation providers provide the customer experience to merchants as they do to consignees.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wI6F9YCUSylR6YEm/EdXpx3+tSPWswVxxsWjQupM8cY="},"bc6a3d88-fb57-42d6-bb83-caabb571e32e":{"id_":"bc6a3d88-fb57-42d6-bb83-caabb571e32e","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/logistics/first-mile-delivery/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0e40c8e2-aac6-4bfe-842c-eb36d2ca0477","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/logistics/first-mile-delivery/"},"hash":"3Qb5fd5gZFBaU+NG3HiPeT+sU37MUkNCVqokyMFWRtc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e30ea8dd-9041-4add-8c5b-66e4b8235a0b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/logistics/first-mile-delivery/"},"hash":"LOF0hFlapwKpwABWu2FARcq/VX0wI2Fg4NfKluZCk8o="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"74882a44-28e1-4bc0-9944-d40b36eaac4c","metadata":{},"hash":"FBP9GcOY4/FeJ9JkeR1/FBdY59qFKjGz5UA2MZx+gbo="}},"text":"Enabling

customer experience to merchants as they do to consignees.Providing retailers with visibility on first mile tracking will make a big difference in how they view working with that provider.Mobile inventory visibility – The sooner you know what’s on a truck, the sooner you can optimize routes and schedule the sequence for the truck’s departure.3D load building: Optimizing how inventory is loaded onto the truck will make unloading at the warehouse or distribution center, and segmenting it there, much faster.TIP – Tracking is about more than just the shipper experience.Tracking incoming trucks and having ETAs dynamically updated will free up truck terminals, prepare areas for loading on time, and prevent delays in order fulfillment.Enabling real-time operations takes this a step further and assumes that shipment information and other data can not only be passed in real time, but reacted to.For example, cloud solutions today can enable not only real time tracking, but also live communications between the retailer and driver, and between the transportation team (to manage exceptions quickly).Real-time visibility is a necessity for enabling on-demand delivery: the ability to offer an accurate quote, make changes to scheduled deliveries in real time, or even dispatch trucks to pick up a shipment for next-day delivery.Shipments need more flexibility to meet consumer demands.Another way to do this while gaining a competitive edge is by providing shorter delivery windows.This, too, relies on automation.In fact, it is difficult to offer any flexibility at any point in the supply chain in real time, and at scale, without automating the first mile network.Giving your shippers a voice: A big part of the delivery experience is feeling that your experience matters, to someone.And while the current supply-demand ratio makes shippers compete to be the ‘shipper of choice’, that may change, especially as shippers get used to working with multiple logistics providers for the same regions.It’s important to show shippers that their experience matters to you.After providing them with a B2B service on the level of a B2C last mile delivery service, the next way of showing this is to give shippers the option of rating their pickup experience.Plus, shippers can offer the same technology and delivery experience to their own customers.Managing the change to digital across the first mile\nFor many logistics service providers, much if not all of the first mile shipping process is manual.The first step in reducing costs and increasing efficiency is to move all operations and supply chain data online.Keep in mind that you need applications which provide transparency and control to all stakeholders: From dispatchers, to drivers, to operations managers, and all the way to the shippers.To learn more about taking your logistics operations digital, or optimizing delivery operations, visit Bringg.com/logistics.Frequently Asked Questions:\nWhat is first mile

small to medium sized items as single shipments.In 2020, parcel shipping experienced a steep increase reaching a high of 16.4% of all retail sales.In fact, Pitney Bowes Global Shipping Index pegged the frequency of worldwide ecommerce parcel shipments at an astounding 5000 parcels per second.As a result, parcel shipping optimization has become a critical concern for retailers as they look for ways to keep costs low and remain competitive.Technology is the driving force behind the next phase of international parcel delivery services.And here is where last mile delivery management platforms (DMP) comes into play.A DMP enables retailers to manage all their last mile delivery operations from one place, providing scalability along with complete end-to-end visibility, real-time communications and AI-based route optimization.How does parcel shipping work?Parcel shipping begins with the consumer placing an order.A textbook example is the case of an order from an online store.The goods are then located, put in appropriate packaging and auto sorted and shipped depending on the location of the recipient.It is normal for such packages to be transferred a number of times during this process as carriers make use of their networks to get parcels from A to B as efficiently and speedily as possible.Ultimately, each package reaches a stage in which it is grouped together with other items due for final delivery in roughly the same area, and sent to the recipient’s location.Parcel shipping trends\nAs demand for same and next day delivery grows, retailers are looking for storage spaces that are closer to their customers.To remain competitive, retailers and 3PL logistics providers need to focus their resources on shipping optimization, especially last mile delivery which makes up 53% of the total shipping costs.Looking forward, a growing number of retailers and international shipping services are already testing drones and autonomous vehicles to provide the best possible delivery experience for their customers.7 steps to parcel shipping optimization\nThere are seven steps that make up the shipping process for most ecommerce companies, from online checkout through last mile delivery.A DMP can centralize each of the key steps needed to be effective.1.Integrate all relevant systems into a centralized platform\nEcommerce parcel shipping involves many different systems including finance, inventory, online ordering and last mile delivery.Leading retailers today are deploying DMPs that are open to partner ecosystems enabling integration of an efficient delivery process into the IT stack.2.Optimize task dispatch and routes\nWhen orders are reported by the system, it’s critical that the shipping process takes into account the most optimal routes based on customer drop-off locations and the geographical area that needs to be covered.With customers expecting shorter drop-off windows, retailers must offer multiple options including same and next day delivery.3.Establish a delivery network\nMore than ever, it’s critical to have an effective delivery hub in place.The benefits are numerous as it connects retailers with unlimited delivery providers for accomodating changing business needs.It also cuts costs by locating drivers that can offer the best price for a particular delivery.Third party logistics companies often have local partners that handle their last mile deliveries.These items must be efficiently sorted according to special bar codes that identify which packages are being delivered using in-house drivers and which parcels are shipped using carriers.4.Enable last mile visibility\nHaving full visibility in the last mile is key.In order to optimize last mile delivery operations for parcel deliveries, all items need to be scanned prior to going on trucks.This way, a central system can track shipments at every step of the journey.This visibility should include a real-time interface that allows the customer to track their parcel from the time it leaves the warehouse to the time it reaches the recipient’s door – enhancing the full customer experience.5.Ensure customer engagement\nIn addition to tracking, retailers must establish open channels of communication with customers.Having direct communication keeps the customer in control and fosters trust with the retailer, making it more likely a customer will return.6.Have solid proof of delivery \nWith such a high volume of deliveries, it’s important that verifiable records are kept through a proof of delivery system.That includes requiring a driver to get a signature and scanning of a bar code prior to leaving the location of the delivery.That information is then sent to a central system and logged.If at any point the customer makes a claim that the item was not delivered, the company has proof.7.Consider returns as important as shipments\nThe rise in ecommerce has also resulted in a rise of product returns.Central to this is the need to transfer countless small and medium-sized parcels from consumers back to warehouses.Traditionally, customers had to take items back to the store, today more people are ordering a return collection.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Lrql4EFEbyElqKSBAW25R726tNjgJjdDLn0CVUUayAw="},"3bff0b6f-6904-4643-8ec3-642e1142da47":{"id_":"3bff0b6f-6904-4643-8ec3-642e1142da47","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/parcel-shipping/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"d205df7e-f61c-4397-ba66-653bbce75131","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/parcel-shipping/"},"hash":"bIFAH4xERQGedoYaMje0LBnP1bR6LIxlg1vR/YBmSJo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"eeaa24fd-5dc2-48cf-94d7-d81333704479","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/parcel-shipping/"},"hash":"Lrql4EFEbyElqKSBAW25R726tNjgJjdDLn0CVUUayAw="}},"text":"5.Ensure

of product returns.Central to this is the need to transfer countless small and medium-sized parcels from consumers back to warehouses.Traditionally, customers had to take items back to the store, today more people are ordering a return collection.This requires items to come with a slip or sticker with the sender’s address, so that a carrier can arrive at the consumer’s location in order to verify, collect and prepare packages for return.Once collected, it’s often then placed in a truck alongside other items, all to be taken back to a warehouse or sorting center.Summary\nParcel shipping optimization is a critical aspect of ecommerce retail.As the industry continues to grow, retailers are facing increased competition and pressure to offer low prices and fast delivery to customers.By adopting a DMP, retailers can reduce their shipping costs and improve delivery times, allowing them to offer competitive prices and improve customer satisfaction.Frequently asked questions\nWhat is the cheapest way to ship a parcel?There is no one cheapest method for retailers to send small packages.Each shipment depends on the location of the sender and the recipient, how quickly the order needs to be fulfilled, and a myriad other factors.For retailers, it’s essential to have multiple options in order to match orders to the couriers best suited to carry out the task.How can retailers keep up?In a word: Diversification.The traditional method of a single courier or fulfillment model is no longer able to meet new e-commerce delivery volumes.According to Bringg research, over 55% of retailers are now using multiple fleets for delivery.Latest Bringg Updates\nDelivery\nOptimizing Big & Bulky eCommerce: Peak Season Strategies for Success\nHow can big & bulky retailers provide

Dalin-Kaptzan\n·\nOct 22, 2020\nRecently, Bringg hosted a retail webinar addressing holiday success.The panel discussion included FedEx VP Bonnie Voldeng and Deloitte retail & supply chain Lead Bill Kammerer.Bringg’s VP Marketing Daniela Perlmutter hosted the discussion covering key trends pushing change in retail fulfillment.Both Bonnie and Bill provided easy to implement tips on how retailers can scale up and optimize their last mile operations to capitalize on peak season demand.Here are a few highlights from the webinar:\nOn Increasing Delivery Capacity:\n“Bundling is better…Offer a product or shipping discount to encourage order consolidation.“When you consolidate an order into one shipment, you can reduce your order fulfillment efforts and your shipping costs significantly.”– Bonnie Voldeng, VP FedEx Freight\n“While the last mile may be a point of contention,…you now have distribution centers that [have] to operate…at a smaller capacity just because of maintaining social distancing.“If there’s a positive COVID test on a shift there will be an impact on throughput capacity of that facility just to get the product into the last mile system.Many retailers are having to address this with additional workers and expanding into multiple shifts.“\n– Bill Kammerer, Deloitte\nOn Crowdsourced delivery:\n“A lot of retailers…are starting to branch out from the very traditional shippers and getting into many of the micro market delivery capabilities…in particular, retailers that have a physical footprint.“you’re starting to see much more of the fulfillment coming out of the store, and leveraging local market delivery…developing relationships with either smaller, local based courier’s, looking at the doordashes, or the instacarts, or even some of the more kind of unique Gig drivers.”– Bill Kammerer, Deloitte\nClick Below to watch the full webinar:\nOn emphasizing a fulfillment channel to scale up and optimize:\n“51% of shoppers [are] actually going to look to have their shipments that they buy [for] Christmas sent to the recipient…this is going to put even more of a strain on retailers to be able to handle multiple delivery mechanisms.”– Bill Kammerer, Deloitte\nOn how to prepare for rising shipping costs:\n“Shipping demand is usually highest on Mondays, so promotions launched over the weekend have the potential to be problematic…an earlier start to the season may also save on cost on certain surcharges that would be applied later in the peak season.”Bonnie Voldeng, VP FedEx Freight\nOptimizing retail footprint?“inventory has to be tracked across all selling platforms…retailers shouldn’t accept orders for inventory that they don’t have and possibly cannot get or replace prior to the holiday season.”Bonnie Voldeng\nBuilding up brand loyalty prior to the holiday rush:\n“Overcommunicate order status to buyers during the entire sales and shipment process.”“When it comes to their orders, customers would rather have too much information than not enough.”Bonnie Voldeng, VP FedEx Freight\nKeeping customers at the center\n“Returns are a large determining factor at times to shoppers online…62% of shoppers online [will] leave a retail site if they do not offer a return policy.”– Bill Kammerer, Deloitte\n**********\nReady for more retail and logistics tips?Watch the full webinar here.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]\nLatest Bringg

customer demands surrounding their delivery experiences have changed the way businesses are addressing their delivery and fulfillment operations.Studies show that 45% of customers expect a two-hour delivery window or less, to the 80% of eCommerce customers who expect real-time delivery tracking.These customer demands are forcing businesses of every type—including retailers, restaurants, grocers, logistics service providers, and many others—to redefine how they manage the last mile.While it is becoming increasingly difficult for businesses to meet these rising expectations, doing so is crucial for improving conversion rates, increasing brand loyalty and generating sustainable, long-term growth.What is last mile logistics?Last mile logistics refers to the operational capabilities (including physical spaces, software systems, delivery fleets, human resources, etc.) that businesses have in place.The ultimate goal of this complex operational setup is to enable businesses to provide their customers with the best possible last mile delivery experience, which ends when the goods or services they ordered are in their hands. .In today’s eCommerce landscape, where Amazon is not the only innovator and increasing numbers and types of businesses are offering impeccable delivery experiences, optimize their last mile logistical operations is an imperative for any business with goods or services that need to be delivered.The Challenges of Last Mile Logistics\nSome of the challenges businesses face when it comes to last mile logistics include:\nGaining visibility and data on the supply chain\nThis crucial component of any delivery operation requires up-to-date data on not only into the exact location of the orders and related inventory, but also on the number of open orders from every ecommerce site; the related internal processes; the internal or external fleets that are available to make the deliveries; and more.By having data on the delivery flow, as well as customer data, businesses will gain insights that are crucial for understanding and optimizing delivery operations.These improvements will then enable businesses to offer the speed, flexibility and convenience that customers expect.Managing multiple fleets and/or crowdsourced fleets\nBusinesses which rely on fleets beyond their own internal ones face a unique set of challenges that must be addressed.This is especially relevant considering the external delivery personnel who are the ones making the critical last mile touchpoint with customers.Businesses employing multiple and/or crowdsourced fleets must find ways to maintain full control over the entire delivery process to ensure that their business needs surrounding branding and quality of service are met.Only by maintaining this control will they be able to ensure that they’re able to meet and exceed their customers’ delivery expectations.Building and maintaining multiple delivery models while controlling costs\nWhile businesses providing deliveries must work to optimize their customers’ delivery experiences, they also need to reduce related costs in order to maintain a positive ROI.Doing so while scaling and expanding to offer a variety of delivery models (planned, on-demand, etc.) creates various problems across different parts of the delivery ecosystem.Below are five key steps businesses can take to address these challenges and orchestrate more efficient last mile logistics operations.5 Steps to optimized last mile logistics\n1.Centralize your data\nRegardless of how many channels delivery-related data is coming from or what those channels are, businesses must centralize everything that comes in from fleets, aggregator sites and other external providers, as well as their internal systems.Only by being able to access their data from one centralized system can businesses truly understand what’s happening in their delivery ecosystem and make the adjustments needed to provide the ideal last mile experience.Related: Logistics Report – Meeting the Demand for Rapid, Convenient Delivery\n2.Use data to inform your decisions and optimize processes.Being “last mile blind” is no longer an option for businesses seeking to differentiate themselves with an optimized last mile offering.To properly make the improvements needed to meet and exceed customer expectations at the point of delivery, businesses need to gain accurate, real-time insights and data into every aspect of their delivery operations—and they must use these insights to inform any decisions they make regarding process optimization.3.Automate, automate, automate\nTo manage last mile logistics in a way that enables businesses to provide the best delivery experience possible, automation is a must.Today, businesses of any size, in any industry, have access to technologies that can enable them to cost-effectively provide faster, more efficient deliveries using their existing resources.4.Choose forward-thinking technology\nSpeaking of technology, businesses taking control over their last mile logistics must opt for technologies that enables them to digitize and connect every step of their last mile logistics.Only then will they be able to provide the convenience that customers demand while achieving efficient, cost-effective processes that support a positive ROI.5.Embrace a gradual scaling process\nScaling is key for businesses that want to achieve long-term growth.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YiQr5eG6mRxDPn/eJJ1kdR58WqP7bWT/+WIURLkRmTU="},"bdc1634a-df82-4b3d-b157-51e84d76decf":{"id_":"bdc1634a-df82-4b3d-b157-51e84d76decf","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/logistics/5-steps-last-mile-logistics/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"cb8b9bb3-f102-4376-9b96-c6f710b1ed9d","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/logistics/5-steps-last-mile-logistics/"},"hash":"dzZ/UDv546M9IG79Eb8o1HObj9onYpnIt7EbJWQINzY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7a4fc17a-3f16-4755-9f7e-cea340233968","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/logistics/5-steps-last-mile-logistics/"},"hash":"YiQr5eG6mRxDPn/eJJ1kdR58WqP7bWT/+WIURLkRmTU="}},"text":"3.Automate,

businesses that want to achieve long-term growth.Businesses need to first test delivery-related technologies or updates under real conditions at only a few stores or locations, before scaling them up to a country or chain-wide offering.Many of today’s customers consider the ideal delivery experience to be more important than their satisfaction with the item they’ve received.With this in mind, it’s no wonder that market share is now dictated in part by how businesses manage their last-mile logistics.Those hoping to differentiate themselves must do so by offering exceptional delivery experiences, which are built upon a tested and solid approach to managing their last mile logistics.Frequently asked questions:\nWhat is meant by last mile logistics?Last mile logistics is the last step in the delivery process.The last mile begins as soon as a customer places an order.The brand or logistics provider gathers and prepares the order for delivery and then delivers to the customer in the method chosen.What is the last mile issue?The main issue in the last mile is cost.50% of total shipping costs occur in the last mile and therefore shipping providers have to add surcharge fees and don’t have the capacity for many shippers.At the same time, shippers have to place some of the delivery cost on consumers, a method that can endanger their attractiveness in the very large and competitive retail and eCommerce markets.What is a last mile delivery center?A last mile delivery center is the warehouse or place where shipments are prepared to make their way to customers.Last mile delivery centers must use technology and automation to ensure that their work is efficient to meet customer demands.Latest Bringg Updates\nDelivery\nOptimizing Big & Bulky eCommerce: Peak Season Strategies for

are a priority for every ecommerce retailer right now.And since last mile delivery costs account for roughly half of total shipping costs, that is where retailers need to concentrate their efforts.Analyzing what makes last mile delivery so expensive, and understanding the cost breakdown, is the first step in streamlining last mile delivery operations.Here are 3 strategies for e-commerce companies that can cut last mile delivery costs today and tomorrow.How much of the total shipping costs go to the last mile?When considering that the last mile represents 53% of total shipping costs, it means that cost-cutting measures must be concentrated on last mile delivery.It’s interesting to consider that getting parcels from a distribution center to the customer’s home in Topeka, Kansas, may be a small part of the physical journey from a factory in Shanghai, but still represents half of the last mile logistic costs and ultimately determines customer satisfaction.The pressure to reduce costs is further aggravated by consumer expectations for free shipping which must be absorbed by retailers.Passing on the cost of delivery to customers directly is simply not an option: when delivery costs are too high for consumers, they simply look for another place to shop.If you end up charging more for deliveries, many of your customers will leave.With customers already expecting free next day and cheap same day delivery, businesses simply can’t afford to push the last mile delivery costs on them.For this reason, deliveries are often an economic balancing act and frequently the largest last mile delivery challenge a company will face.What is the last mile delivery problem?For traditional delivery through large carriers, last mile delivery was based on large drop density with multiple stops, idle time and handling.Last mile delivery often has the exact opposite characteristics: smaller drop density and fewer stops.This increases the average cost per truck run.What makes last mile delivery so costly?As mentioned, the last mile must accommodate multiple delivery models and processes, each one with its own particular challenges.Even small delays in the delivery process can add up to big headaches with missed delivery windows, increased fuel costs and low delivery driver productivity, all of which affect the overall cost to deliver.To be more specific, it’s important to identify some of the main costs associated with last mile delivery such as:\nLabor and operational costs\nWhile expenses differ between industries and delivery models, there are universal costs that impact delivery costs across all verticals and channels, including managing inventory, internal and external fleets, and operational processes.Whether retailers have their own dispatchers, drivers and vehicles, or rely on external carriers and fleets, the manpower adds to delivery costs.The same goes for delivery management systems, especially if retailers are using multiple systems.Failed deliveries\nLate deliveries, and any kind of failed first delivery attempt, lead to repeated delivery attempts.That’s more time on the road that incur additional costs – not to mention a risk to customer retention.Fuel Cost\nWhether it is stop-and-start driving in urban centers or long distances in rural areas, the cost of fuel has always played a major role in delivery costs.And as fuel costs increase, last mile delivery costs rise significantly.The popularity of next day and same day delivery means that retailers frequently try to opt in to these delivery models without properly planning their last mile operations to support them.As a result, drivers go out on delivery runs with only one or two parcels or packages at a time.This is much more fuel-inefficient than traditional scheduled delivery, with higher drop density and multiple drop-off points on the delivery routes (not to mention how much more carbon emissions it produces)\nDelivery Efficiency\nProductivity doesn’t solely depend on the amount of deliveries per tank of gas, but also on the total number of deliveries per driver.Every effort must be made to maximize the number of deliveries each driver makes per shift.Inefficient Route Planning\nLeft to their own devices, delivery drivers will prefer to handle their own route planning or stick to routes they know well and perceive to be best.Unfortunately, many times this does not result in the most efficient route possible resulting in high fuel and labor costs.Now that we have understood some of the main reasons for the high cost of last mile delivery, let’s take these same parameters to understand how to increase efficiencies and reduce costs.3 Strategies for Cutting Last Mile Delivery Costs:\nExplore new logistics models\nReduce fuel costs\nAvoid failed deliveries\nIn order to create more cost effective last mile logistics , it’s important to think about improving efficiency from the moment the order is placed, as well as reducing expenses.1.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HXo3t5psAjJZ9ofnTYniJBLpRUc6OkRD3L8b7031xHQ="},"c76cac94-aedb-4ee9-ae8c-0b073920f131":{"id_":"c76cac94-aedb-4ee9-ae8c-0b073920f131","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/last-mile-delivery-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0c0edee7-b297-4f68-aab3-eacb04469c17","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/last-mile-delivery-costs/"},"hash":"Fae3a09uGAd/ei9KN2gZcE+xBb//6n4loAYIalR0nUk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"548008f4-945c-44c7-8fe5-41f225f2d603","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/last-mile-delivery-costs/"},"hash":"HXo3t5psAjJZ9ofnTYniJBLpRUc6OkRD3L8b7031xHQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"74d0361b-bc3b-4fbc-9bfb-fd57067ebdbe","metadata":{},"hash":"uS4KE9rPHAHZk++aWuXzgi/R9HDbzvZtToj8Mgd9fio="}},"text":"Every

Cutting Last Mile Delivery Costs:\nExplore new logistics models\nReduce fuel costs\nAvoid failed deliveries\nIn order to create more cost effective last mile logistics , it’s important to think about improving efficiency from the moment the order is placed, as well as reducing expenses.1.Explore new delivery models\nThe current instability of the supply chain – together with shrinking margins and pressure to cut delivery costs – means it’s time to explore relationships with new logistics partners.Surging demand and limited capacity have caused the leading last mile delivery service providers, FedEx and UPS to raise rates and limit capacity.This has resulted in increased demand for regional delivery service providers who can provide last mile delivery operations at prices 10-40% less with more flexible terms than the national carriers.Along with more cost effective rates, retailers must also increase drop density where possible to improve fuel and driver efficiency.The only efficient way to determine the best available carrier along with the most efficient way to bundle deliveries to increase drop density, is by using software that can make these calculations as part of a delivery services management solution.2.Reduce Fuel Cost\nEspecially during times of rising oil prices, it’s important to do everything possible to reduce fuel consumption.The best way to do this is to optimize delivery routes so the maximum number of deliveries are made for every tank of gas.This requires delivery route optimization software that is capable of considering all relevant variables when planning efficient routes, including:\nTraffic conditions\ndifferent types of delivery vehicles\ndrop density\nvehicle efficiency.Another tactic is to ensure greater drop density by extending delivery windows and batching orders going to the same geographic area together.These types of complex calculations can only be done with advanced delivery management software that uses AI analytics, together with historical and real time data, to suggest the most optimal route in dynamic conditions.3.Prevent failed deliveries\nWith failed deliveries costing retailers an average of $17.20 per order, every effort must be made to avoid this pitfall.Many times, this loss can be avoided by offering more flexibility, managing expectations and increasing customer communications.Flexibility starts with the shopping journey.If retailers present consumers with multiple delivery options prior to checkout, many shoppers will prioritize price over speed – slower, less expensive delivery methods that enable retailers to increase drop density.From the time of dispatch until the package is in the customer’s hands, it is essential to have real-time tracking and communications.Not only does this help retailers know the exact location of the delivery at any given time, but more importantly enables sharing of that information with consumers and last mile delivery partners.Above all, proper management of customer expectations is key to reducing failed delivery.Communication with customers is key\nDeliveries can be delayed for a variety of reasons; preventing these delays from turning into costly failed delivery attempts depends on prompt communication with the customers.Furthermore, if multiple alternative delivery options are provided to customers whenever there’s a delay, then it reduces the risk of a failed delivery attempt.Good customer-facing communications tools and visibility will actually lower your last mile delivery costs by reducing failed delivery attempts.If customers know exactly when their package leaves the warehouse or store, and get an accurate, narrow delivery window, chances are that they’ll make the effort to be at their door to pick it up.If for some reason the customer cannot make the pickup, or if the driver will miss the delivery window, a customer experience app can prevent missed deliveries.These options can be enabled by real-time communications via mobile or web apps where the customer can check the status of their package at any time and coordinate with the retailer and delivery driver to avoid delivery failure.An app with a good user interface will include automated options that remind the driver to send a preset message in case a late delivery is predicted.The same app can suggest multiple options to the customer, such as accepting a later delivery time slot, or picking up the package at a local locker.Key Takeaways\nE-commerce and customer expectations for last mile delivery continue to grow at a breakneck pace.This places pressure on retailers to cut delivery prices during times when the demand for last mile delivery services is on the rise, while delivery capacity is very limited.Ensuring timely delivery and satisfied customers despite supply chain uncertainty and shrinking margins is a real challenge.Add to that the desire to cut last mile delivery costs, and it almost seems out of reach.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hULgsc+RO3LuwhkVTnTgiUkM2IsoCsSiKaoRI1e3emI="},"74d0361b-bc3b-4fbc-9bfb-fd57067ebdbe":{"id_":"74d0361b-bc3b-4fbc-9bfb-fd57067ebdbe","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/last-mile-delivery-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0c0edee7-b297-4f68-aab3-eacb04469c17","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/last-mile-delivery-costs/"},"hash":"Fae3a09uGAd/ei9KN2gZcE+xBb//6n4loAYIalR0nUk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c76cac94-aedb-4ee9-ae8c-0b073920f131","metadata":{"url":"https://www.bringg.com/blog/delivery/last-mile-delivery-costs/"},"hash":"DqKYSUVKTvtTaCw34BoJPI53OiRGNpw5mzWORPikvAw="}},"text":"These
