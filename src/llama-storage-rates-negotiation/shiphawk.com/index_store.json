Often, companies end up with incorrect rates and have to absorb shipping costs rather than put those costs on their customers when doing it manually.\n With ShipHawk’s automated rate shopping, you can get accurate shipping rates in real-time, before your customers have even completed their orders. Optimize order-level routing across carriers (using your own negotiated rates), service levels, and modes to guarantee the lowest-cost option that meets customer’s delivery expectations.\n  “We’ve reduced shipping costs by 13.5% by no longer having to absorb incorrect freight costs - which I attribute almost 100% to the change to ShipHawk.”\nLinda Colliver, Customer Care and Fulfillment Manager at Silver Oak Cellars\nRead Case Study\nPACKING OPTIMIZATION + RATING\nPacking optimization at the point of rating\nWithout an advanced cartonization solution to determine packing materials, you aren’t getting the most accurate rates for each order. ShipHawk combines rating with its Smart Packing algorithm to make the packing process efficient and accurate by selecting the best pallet or carton for each order, calculating final packed weights and dimensions, and accurately determining the packing and shipping rates in real-time, rather than waiting for manual shipping rates. ShipHawk uses your product dimensions and weights and can provide accurate rates based on available packaging at each warehouse, before the customer has even purchased the product.\n Learn more about Smart Packing →\n Don’t have dimensions? ShipHawk can help with that too →\n    PARCEL & LTL\nRate parcel and LTL in one system\nPacking optimization doesn’t end at small orders. With ShipHawk’s multi-modal rating, you can automatically determine the best way to pack items in an order that includes both parcel and LTL (less-than-truckload). By factoring weight, dimensions, availability of packing materials, and how fast an order needs to get to the customer, ShipHawk will determine whether or not the order should be palletized or packed into small parcels. Additionally, this process can rate mixed products together, combining parcel and LTL for one order if needed so your warehouse team doesn’t have to use multiple shipping portals just to book one order.\n  MULTI-ORIGIN RATING\nChoosing shipping origins with multi-origin rating\nMulti-origin rating from ShipHawk enables you to determine the best warehouse to ship from by looking at your available inventory and the distance between your end customer and the warehouses. \n ShipHawk also lets you create customized rules to manage unique fulfillment scenarios based on your individual business requirements. For example: let’s say it’s the holiday season and orders are increasing rapidly. You can change the default shipping origin to the largest warehouse with more inventory to avoid backorders and delayed shipments.\n    CUSTOMIZE RATING\nCustomizable rating rules for your specific needs\nShipHawk’s robust rating rules can automate set rules and streamline fulfillment processes. With ShipHawk’s rules engine, companies can create custom rules including but not limited to:\nMarkup or markdown rates\nFilter the carrier you would like to see\nFilter the different carriers services you would like to see\nCreate your own custom shipping methods\n Want to automate carrier audit and reconciliation?

It’s a no-brainer for improving the bottom line and growing margins, and all too often, we see businesses look for a “magic bullet” to decrease hard costs, i.e. negotiating better rates, threatening to leave carriers, or introduce new carriers. These are all valid and great ways to reduce shipping costs, but the real spending problem may be closer to home than you think. Tariff based shipping charges account for 80% of shipping expenses so hard costs are definitely an okay place start. But a lot more goes into your shipping rates than the carrier tariff. In fact 20%, and sometimes more, of true shipping costs actually lie in soft costs. In addition, a portion of the 80% hard costs are frequently attributed to soft cost policies and behaviors.\nWhat are Soft Shipping Costs?  \nShipping is the greatest non-COGS expense and it’s growing more than 5% each year. As costs increase, companies need to be more vigilant about identifying areas for shipping cost savings and fulfillment process optimization. But what does this actually look like? And how are these soft costs uncovered?\nTo truly understand everything that contributes to shipping costs, let’s examine the life of an order.\nThe life of an order  \nOrder fulfillment is a long and expensive process that touches every aspect of your business:\nCustomer Service - handles all post-purchase customer inquiries and complaints\nOperations - handles returns, damages, lost shipments, insurance claims\nFinance - is in charge of rebills, accessorial charges, invoice reconciliation, materials charges, labor usage\neCommerce - depends on shipping to influence initial and repeat purchase rates, conversion rates, buyer delivery experience, and online sales\nMarketing - is in charge of the budget that funds shipping subsidization, as well as order growth driven by similar promotions\nIT - is responsible for ensuring all carrier integrations work and all systems effectively speak to one another (WMS, ERP, eCommerce etc)\nIf an expense is related to shipping but is not a direct shipping cost, it can be considered a \"soft cost.\" Items like labor, refunds, fulfillment, customer service, damages, errors, exceptions and returns can all fall under this category.\nShipping is the greatest non-COGS expense and it's growing more than 5% each year.\nDissecting the Fulfillment Process   \nEvery company’s internal processes are a little bit unique, but they all have similarities. Let’s look at an average order fulfillment process.\nStep One - Order is placed \nOrder Placement DetailsStep Two - Order contents are identified \n$ Ideal scenario 1 - the pick list automatically prints details and location of items in the order\n$ Ideal scenario 2 - the warehouse team uses a handheld device to identify and locate the contents of the order\n$$$ Costly scenario - the warehouse team has to manually print documentation \nContent Identification Details\nStep Three - Order is picked\n$ Ideal scenario - Items are scanned for confirmation\n$$$ Costly scenario - Items are manually confirmed \nOrder Picking Details\nStep Four - Order container is selected\nThis step can look different at every warehouse:\n$ Ideal scenario - The software used for order management sends the order data into the shipping software which speaks directly to a box making machine like Packsize and the box was cut and assembled along with an automated pick ticket and shipping label\n$$ Acceptable scenario 1 - The shipping software ingested the order data and calculated the optimal box for the order and indicated the box code on the pick slip.$$ Acceptable scenario 2 - A simple algorithm or spreadsheet cubed out each item in the order and suggested a box size.$$$ Costly scenario 1 - The warehouse team looks at the items order and makes their best guess as to the smallest box to use based on predefined rule.$$$ Costly scenario 2 - The warehouse team selects a box by what looks the best or is closest at hand.Container Selection Details\nStep Five - Order is packed.$ Ideal scenario - Shipping software calculated proper packing materials and labor cost required for order fulfillment.$$ Acceptable scenario - Order is packed according to documented packing standards.$$$ Costly scenario - Warehouse team packs the order using the “best guess” method.Order Packing Details\nStep Six - Shipping carrier and service is selected and label is printed\n$ Ideal scenario 1 - The shipping software calculated the final weights and dims before the order was picked and the label was printed out at the same time as the pick slip and the box.$ Ideal scenario 2 - A dimensioner is used to auto calculate and enter the packed weights and dimensions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"p4iET6idzLfIQvN8FbP7S/pSrB3A8QYCqK+7SaDVJ90="},"433596ad-05af-47ad-8183-fb5c0e2c616b":{"id_":"433596ad-05af-47ad-8183-fb5c0e2c616b","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/20-shipping-costs-are-soft-costs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"130052a9-d934-464e-adf0-0c22a5e17f20","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/20-shipping-costs-are-soft-costs"},"hash":"JsBBhxrzahQJp2dqXWwOJlIDt4mfce8n5RQATS1tsbM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5a311134-6356-4737-b1da-412d21001831","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/20-shipping-costs-are-soft-costs"},"hash":"p4iET6idzLfIQvN8FbP7S/pSrB3A8QYCqK+7SaDVJ90="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"547fe89f-93f5-4f73-af00-a4bebf772858","metadata":{},"hash":"eozhE+/ksBBtNkw0poH3Ats7RydrL9sA3AtmBksr7nk="}},"text":"$$$

software to account for the unexpected charges and prevent them from happening again.Invoice Reconciliation Details\nHow do Soft Shipping Costs Impact Your Bottom Line?After reviewing the 10 stages of order fulfillment above, I’m sure it is more obvious how soft costs can impact your true shipping costs, but let’s take it a step further and look at a real life example in dollars.Consider this example company.Annual shipping spend (carrier shipping charges) - $1.8mm\nWhich equates to:\n4,350 annual LTL shipments at an average of $183.91 per shipment\n55,500 parcel shipments with an average cost of just over $18 (this customer ships many large parcel items)\nAnnual fulfillment labor expense for parcel - $114,187.50\nAnnual fulfillment labor expense for LTL - $139,200\n“Hidden” soft costs for this customer:\nAn average of $26.25 in \"hidden\" costs per parcel shipment\nAn average of $32 in “hidden” labor costs per freight shipment\nWhile soft costs may seem insignificant on the surface, when you look at the aggregate impact on order fulfillment costs and margin they can't be ignored.And this analysis considers ONLY fulfillment labor costs.20%, and sometimes more, of true shipping costs actually lie in soft costs.In addition, a portion of the 80% hard costs are frequently attributed to soft cost policies and behaviors.Defining Soft Shipping Costs\nThe 10 stages of order fulfillment make it clear that shipping costs include more than just those on the carriers’ tariffs According to our data, fulfillment related costs account for an average of 20% of a company’s total true shipping costs.For some businesses it is much more.Every company that sells products directly to customers has fulfillment costs to pay.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rR23QZ0ayftAMPW6gwyhoRhqT4lhUf517FGwbPR450U="},"547fe89f-93f5-4f73-af00-a4bebf772858":{"id_":"547fe89f-93f5-4f73-af00-a4bebf772858","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/20-shipping-costs-are-soft-costs"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"130052a9-d934-464e-adf0-0c22a5e17f20","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/20-shipping-costs-are-soft-costs"},"hash":"JsBBhxrzahQJp2dqXWwOJlIDt4mfce8n5RQATS1tsbM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"433596ad-05af-47ad-8183-fb5c0e2c616b","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/20-shipping-costs-are-soft-costs"},"hash":"nCC8z1pjpueoMnh38tMnWrZwGswkm+8AAdWIw7wECnc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"70a7cd1d-5e5c-47ad-aed6-f4da4899a2b8","metadata":{},"hash":"PNek2nnwRhoMiFJPELMU8tDUs5EQGZvZpQPZClfPZvQ="}},"text":"And

products/shipments)\nReturns processing\nFinance (tasks related to shipping)\nCustomer service (tasks related to shipping)\nSoft cost behavior and policy impact on 80% tariff-based hard costs (i.e. dim weight charges)\nMany of these processes are not routine - meaning there is little or no standardization.Most organizations are using legacy software and processes that rely on dated standards or “best guess” methods which add significant costs to already expensive carrier shipping prices.The greatest shipping hurdle today is not making minor tweaks to your tariffs; it is finding simple and consistent ways to standardize and automate the order fulfillment process so that:\na) fulfillment costs are low\nb) shipping costs are controlled, and...c) data is accurately reported on both\nUnfortunately, the most troubling concern is that in most organizations order fulfillment costs are difficult to quantify because there are few, if any, measured standards.So, it’s important to breakdown the process to understand how to develop an actionable plan to reduce these shipping costs.In other words, let’s uncover the secret to saving on order fulfillment.The greatest shipping hurdle today is not making minor tweaks to your tariffs; it is finding simple and consistent ways to standardize and automate the order fulfillment process so that a) fulfillment costs are low, b) shipping costs are controlled, and c) data is accurately reported on both.How to Save on Soft Shipping Costs\nFortunately, advancements in technology have kept pace with the rise in popularity of omnichannel commerce.This means that the tools exist to solve these problems.So the questions become: How do we know which tools to use?And how do we deploy them?You will see two key themes emerge in the sections below and it is important to understand them in advance.Two key elements missing from manual order fulfillment:\nAutomation - The goal of automation is the consistent implementation of predefined standards.Great effort is put into establishing best practices.Automation guarantees those best practices are employed consistently, across every order.In addition, when done right, automation also allows shippers to skip steps, eliminate manual processes, and cut costs that were necessities of the manual systems it was built to replace.Data - The goal of data is to provide a better understanding of the output of current systems in order to facilitate decision making, forecasting, and more specifically, system improvements.Without a clear, measured picture of the order fulfillment process, it is impossible to understand the true costs, capacity, or capability of the system.In order to optimize order fulfillment costs and processes, shippers need to have a record of the output of every stage, and the tools for making adjustments.Additional Considerations\nCustomer Service\nCustomer Service Expenses - It should come as no surprise that automation reduces customer service use and costs.Through a decrease in damages and returns, error-free packing and packaging, and branded, on-site tracking and push notifications, fulfillment-related customer service calls decrease while post-purchase Net Promoter Scores rise.Returns, Damage and Mispicks\nReturns - Ecommerce shippers experience far more returns than brick and mortar stores.Where brick and mortar product returns average about 8.89%, 30% of all products ordered online are returned to the company.This is a key cost to pay attention to, especially if free shipping is offered.Returns costs can be reduced with automation and accurate data.Damage - Damaged packages are generally a result of human error, but it's frequently difficult to determine whether the error lies in the shipper’s warehouse or with the carrier.Being able to report on the full order fulfillment process will help shed light on damage trends and the steps needed to reduce or eliminate the problem.Do they come primarily from specific warehouses or shipping carriers?If you know for sure, you have the advantage of being able to address this problem at the source and find a real solution.Mispicks - Inaccurate order contents is another source of added costs.By using scan functionality to ensure the right items are included in the order, mispicks can be reduced or eliminated.What is the ShipHawk

Shipping Cost Savings Through Carrier Service and Routing Optimization\nHard Shipping Cost Savings Through Carrier Service and Routing Optimization\nChristian Hirsch\nNovember 14, 2017\nShare:\nWhat Are Hard Shipping Cost Savings?Reduce Shipping Costs with Carrier Service and Routing Optimization\nImagine you could review any of your contracts or terms of service with existing vendors — and in each case you’d find within those documents opportunities to immediately save your company up to 50% of what you’re currently paying those providers.Think about it: Your $45,000 annual expense for cloud data storage suddenly falls to $30,000.Your benefits administrator is able make a few minor adjustments and lower your workers’ compensation MOD rate from the industry average of 1.0 down to a .8 — resulting in a 20% reduction in your insurance costs.Even your PR firm agrees to lower its monthly retainer by 20%.Sound too good to be true?When it comes to most services, it usually is.But there is one service your company uses frequently — in fact, it’s a component of virtually every sale your business makes — where you can save significant amounts of money by using any or all of the following methods:\n1) Better utilizing the services already available to you from your existing vendors\n2) Applying the right technology to uncover cost-saving opportunities on every order\n3) Further diversifying your provider network with additional vendors whose offers might be more cost-effective.That service is shipping — for many businesses, it’s the low-hanging fruit in hard-cost savings opportunities.Let’s examine a few of the ways that your business is almost certainly spending more than it should for your shipping processes — and how in many cases the solution is simply taking advantage of the carrier services and options already available to you.You’re Not Alone: Most Businesses Spend More Than Necessary On Their Shipping Processes\nBefore we jump into an explanation of the various ways businesses are missing readily available opportunities for hard savings on shipping, consider this statistic about the pervasiveness of the problem.We work closely with hundreds of shipping-dependent organizations every year.These include large retailers, eCommerce storefronts, marketplace platforms, manufacturers, distributors — B2B and B2C businesses of every size and across just about every industry.Our analyses of the shipping processes of this large sample of businesses show that 95% are not optimized.Our analyses show that 95% of all businesses are missing opportunities for hard savings due to suboptimal shipping processes\nA Quick Illustration of How Your Existing Carrier’s Shipping Services Could Save You Money\nSo, what do we mean exactly by better utilizing the carrier services and options already available to you?We’ll describe several such services below, but here’s a quick example to give you a more concrete understanding of the types of money-saving opportunities we’re talking about.Consider two of the most common types of delivery surcharges from the major carriers like UPS and FedEx — residential delivery surcharges and delivery area surcharges.Many shippers pay these surcharges every time they use one of these major carriers and the delivery qualifies for one — or both — of these added fees.(The “residential delivery surcharge,” in case you’re unfamiliar with the term, applies to any delivery to a home, or business operating in a home, that does not have an entrance accessible to the public.A “delivery area surcharge” applies to deliveries to areas that the carrier deems rural.And note: Shippers can and often do pay both of these surcharges on the same delivery.)Few businesses realize that these surcharges add considerably to their shipping charges.And fewer still know this interesting fact:\nUSPS Priority Mail offers a flat-rate service — often up to 20% lower than the comparable ground services of FedEx and UPS — that does not include surcharges for either residential delivery or delivery to rural areas.In other words, using USPS Priority Mail instead of UPS or FedEx Ground for deliveries to these surcharge-triggering addresses can save your company significantly on shipping costs.As this example illustrates, for many shippers, the ability to immediately realize costs savings on shipping doesn’t even require that they leave their existing carriers.Many shippers can uncover these cost-saving opportunities simply by finding more intelligent ways of using their current carriers and selecting the most cost-effective carrier and service for each order.The Most Common Reasons Businesses Miss Opportunities to Save On Shipping Costs\nWhy do so many business fail to take advantage of cost-saving opportunities in their shipping processes?Typically, we find, it is simply a lack of true understanding of their shipping infrastructure, which leads to several missteps:\n1.Working with too few carriers\nThere are many hundreds of shipping companies out there, yet many shipping-dependent businesses work only with a handful of big-name carriers — often paying far more for less service because they simply haven’t expanded their carrier network to include the best shipping partners for each order.2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"l6eWUuPL6HJmn+u/2mXIAbgMTqKfPIko95GQGN/TJ+Y="},"3af3e332-cd71-4ae0-b1a6-0d61443760fa":{"id_":"3af3e332-cd71-4ae0-b1a6-0d61443760fa","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/shipping-savings-carrier-service-routing-optimization"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ca142ab4-afae-4d04-8c08-29ffa3454b70","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/shipping-savings-carrier-service-routing-optimization"},"hash":"PSkaTC4rVBa/F1at2JKwvK2VL4KsLsQiD1Ju7LUUxa4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8a7aa427-b5db-4070-b4ae-5ab3b9a86973","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/shipping-savings-carrier-service-routing-optimization"},"hash":"l6eWUuPL6HJmn+u/2mXIAbgMTqKfPIko95GQGN/TJ+Y="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"908e56e9-3845-4509-9234-6e3dd8a099fd","metadata":{},"hash":"TYHpJZCG9UnxcmnAtOz18dFjXy42u+O09xLRLoKjrxg="}},"text":"As

shipping-dependent businesses work only with a handful of big-name carriers — often paying far more for less service because they simply haven’t expanded their carrier network to include the best shipping partners for each order.2.Working with the wrong carriers\nA related mistake many businesses make is settling for the first shipping partners they find, and sticking with these carriers despite high costs, service problems or lack of options that could improve the shipper’s margins and customer experience.In the worst of these cases, a company will sign an exclusive agreement with a single carrier for all of its shipping business — a contract that, over time, erodes the carrier’s incentive to work as hard or deliver as much value as it could for that business.3.Failing to select the most cost-effective carrier for a given order\nAs pointed out above, many shippers default to FedEx or UPS for deliveries to customers whose addresses include both the “residential delivery” and “delivery area” surcharges.This is even the case when identical delivery service from USPS will often be upwards of 20% less expensive than UPS or FedEx regardless of whether the delivery falls into one of the surcharge categories.Companies repeatedly make these same mistakes because they do not have strong visibility into their own shipping infrastructure — more specifically, because they don’t have an automated system that would allow them to select the right carrier for each job.Which leads us to another common mistake.4.Not deploying software to help them select the optimal carrier for every order\nGiven that every order will be different — routes, delivery times, carrier availability, optimal packaging all vary and various accessorial might apply — a business will rarely be able to make the most cost-effective decisions for each shipment without slowing down the process and devoting a lot of in-house resources to reviewing every order.What these businesses need is an automated system — specifically, carrier optimization and routing software that lets them automatically select the carrier and service that meets the transit and delivery requirements of a given order at the lowest possible cost.5.Defining “shipping” far too narrowly\nConsider all of the areas of a business that are affected by shipping.Complaints about damaged or inaccurate shipments consume Customer Support resources.Rebills, accessorial charges, invoice reconciliation and other billing issues require time and resources from the Finance team.Shipping touches virtually every department in a company — Operations, IT, Marketing, you name it.Defining shipping costs too narrowly may cause a businesses to miss chances to significantly reduce their costs,\nDiscussing all of the way businesses can optimize all of these areas of their shipping infrastructure is beyond the scope of this post.But you can find a deep discussion of this topic — including cost-cutting suggestions — in our post on Shipping Soft Costs.More Tips for Cutting Shipping Costs by Better Leveraging Your Existing Services and Options\nLet’s now dig in and examine some practical measures that are available to your company right now for lowering your shipping costs.Leverage the “Time in Transit” Model   \nMany successful retailers (including Amazon) offer their customers multiple shipping options, broken out according to delivery times.Customers who are willing to pay more for faster delivery can select a shorter time in transit.A customer who has placed several items in their shopping cart and is now selecting a shipping option might see the following services:\n- Free Shipping: 5-7 days (the default option)\n- Standard shipping: 3-5 days\n- Priority shipping: 1-3 days\n- 2-day shipping: 2 days\n- Next-day shipping: 1 day\nWhen a retailer offers this range of shipping options, they will need to support the service with a back-end shipping process.This process allows the retailer to choose from a wider selection of carriers, to find the best — in aspects such as reliability and lowest price —  for each order that are able to meet the customer's requested delivery date.What’s important here is to display the various shipping options available to the customer — and to de-emphasize the carriers’ names.This will allow you to let your customer choose the level of service they are interested in — and willing to pay for — without committing your company to giving that order to a specific carrier.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"LnQLLi1GxjcxB2QdJnXJMy6Jeve5O5rYmave5qkkvxs="},"908e56e9-3845-4509-9234-6e3dd8a099fd":{"id_":"908e56e9-3845-4509-9234-6e3dd8a099fd","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/shipping-savings-carrier-service-routing-optimization"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ca142ab4-afae-4d04-8c08-29ffa3454b70","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/shipping-savings-carrier-service-routing-optimization"},"hash":"PSkaTC4rVBa/F1at2JKwvK2VL4KsLsQiD1Ju7LUUxa4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3af3e332-cd71-4ae0-b1a6-0d61443760fa","metadata":{"url":"https://blog.shiphawk.com/shipping-savings-carrier-service-routing-optimization"},"hash":"vJa+PCrTbbSXAqui8cf50s57Sq6Vfcu82fDsN2vspVY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4f9da067-7db7-452c-8a96-dc6076b1a324","metadata":{},"hash":"kInyHZXk4HhhdYfrVHrPFEmfvDJVwQJG6D+qPNOTdSc="}},"text":"This

choose the level of service they are interested in — and willing to pay for — without committing your company to giving that order to a specific carrier.Leverage Available Standard Services for Expedited Delivery  \nHere’s a follow-on to the previous tip.Let’s say your company decides to offer “time in transit” shipping options to your customers as part of standard order fulfillment.And let’s say a customer opts for second-day delivery.In many cases — particularly when the customer’s address is within the carrier’s immediate delivery area — you can offer this expedited service without any additional charge to your company beyond the standard Ground or Priority delivery service.This can save your company 40% or even 50% over another carrier’s rushed-delivery charge —while at the same time providing your customer a better overall shopping experience.Deploy Shipping Optimization Software to Automate Your Processes and Make Better-Informed Decisions\nBoth of the suggestions above, as well as many of the advice on this page, will be easiest to implement if your company deploys the right shipping optimization platform.Such a software application will look at all aspects of every order — size, weight, accessorial, distance, delivery deadline—and automatically determine the lowest available cost option that will meet all required shipping criteria.The software will then automate the booking and label creation, generate a record of the transaction’s details that it will build into an ongoing algorithm it can apply to future orders.The key to making this work, to finding cost-optimization opportunities for every shipment your company sends out, is to leverage intelligent software capable of making dozens of complex calculations in real-time — uncovering cost-cutting insights with rates of efficiency that are simply not practical when performed on a manual basis yet will have a significant fiscal impact on your bottom line over time.Conclusion: You Can Realize Significant Hard-Cost Savings — Starting Right Now — by Tweaking Your Shipping Infrastructure\nIf you want a better sense of how much money your company could be saving by better utilizing the carrier services available to you today — and by deploying the right shipping technology to automatically identify those opportunities — you might be able to conduct a little research into your own shipment history to get a ballpark estimate.Many businesses that analyze a subset of their historical shipping data uncover cost-saving opportunities that they could have achieved had they been leveraging certain carriers and services available to them — along with the right software platform to take advantage of these opportunities.Then, extrapolating out these missed opportunities, the businesses are able to estimate how much an optimized shipping infrastructure could have saved them over a given period of time.Most businesses that conduct this type of analysis come to a similar conclusion we see when shipping-dependent companies actually implement these processes and deploy the right software to support them — and the cost savings are impressive:\nBusinesses with shipping costs greater than $500,000 can immediately achieve:\n- 10% to 30% savings, on average, over current parcel spend\n- 5% to 10% LTL savings\n- $1,500 savings, on average, per 100 LTL shipments\n- The ability to repurpose 1 to 3 employees or full-time-equivalents\nNote: These savings do not negatively affect a company’s existing negotiated carrier rates and services.Knowing the significant savings available to your company on the other side of some minor adjustments to your shipping processes, it’s time to ask yourself: Is your shipping infrastructure optimized, or could it benefit from a

You Can Reduce Small Business Shipping Costs\nWhere You Can Reduce Small Business Shipping Costs\nShae Burrows\nOctober 30, 2020\nShare:\nWhere You Can Reduce Small Business Shipping Costs\nHow can your small business reduce its shipping costs? As this question is probably asked as frequently as “How can I get that shipped for free?” by customers, it’s necessary for small businesses to get creative. Here are some tips for identifying and trimming excess spending in shipping. \nPackaging: Depending on what you ship, packaging can be a significant cost for small businesses. If you happen to ship things with dimensions that correspond well with the free packaging on an offer from all of the major carriers, then you’re in luck and can request materials as an account holder. There are also cheaper, alternative packaging materials to consider, such as polyurethane mailers, which are also likely to cut down on DIM weight charges. Lastly, though it may seem counterintuitive, investing in custom packaging might save money down the line as it is also an effective means of advertising your brand. \n                                                          Distance: If you’re shipping a considerable amount to far-off zones, or even internationally, adopting some method of hub and spoke fulfillment might be of service for your business. By partnering with third-party logistics companies, you can store and ship your items much closer to their destination, thereby saving you the time of fulfillment and the repetitive cost of long-distance shipping. Alternately, if many of your customers are fairly local to your business, free local pick-up or looking into smaller, regional delivery companies could potentially cut down on costs. \nWeight: There’s not much you can do about how much your product weighs, but there’s a lot you can do about how you package and ship it! If you consistently and predictably send items of a certain weight, flat rate or prepaid shipping from your carrier could be a smart move. No matter what, though, a package’s physical weight is just one aspect of measurement considered by carriers, who also calculate a package’s dimensional or DIM weight. Though major carriers assess this measurement via different formulas, all are attempting to charge for the space a package takes up rather than just its weight. In other words, make sure that your items fit inside their packaging as snugly as is safely possible. \nShipper: Small businesses can have the highest relative shipping costs as their output often doesn’t qualify them for negotiated contracts with major carriers. However, there are still many ways for small businesses to reduce shipping costs! There are a multitude of third-party shipping consolidators to pair with, thereby granting your business the perks known to larger companies. It’s also worthwhile to invest in software that helps streamline the fulfillment process; along with shipping discounts, such software also automates and streamlines the process of getting goods to your customers, saving you valuable time as well. \nAccessorials: Finally, it’s important to know that the shipping cost can often be just the beginning. Most carriers charge extra for accessorials, or things like signature confirmation.

That’s why when a shipment is configured with ShipHawk, it automatically chooses the cheapest rate to meet your customers’ delivery expectations.\nWhat Is Shipping Rate Comparison?\nShipping rate comparison, or rate shopping, can mean a lot of different things to different people so let’s cut to the chase on exactly what it does and does not mean in this article.\nWhat it does not mean: it’s not ‘what is the cheapest option’ or ‘show me a dropdown list of shipping options to pick from’\nWhat it does mean: it’s the ability to automatically dictate a package, carrier, and service level based on your own negotiated rates and when the customer wants their shipment to arrive\nFor example, if a customer pays $30 for an overnight shipment, shipping rate comparison would tell you exactly what is the fastest and cheapest way to get the shipment to your customer overnight. \nWhy Is Comparing Shipping Rates Important?\nOne of the most important steps in reducing shipping costs is having the ability to compare shipping rates in one system and in real time. Additionally, instead of having a warehouse worker manually rate shop, often requiring them to jump from system to system, ShipHawk’s rate shopping automatically allocates all of your negotiated carrier rates in one system, making it easy for the warehouse worker to select the cheapest rate to get that shipment to the customer on time.\nHow Does ShipHawk’s Rate Shopping Work?\nWhen ShipHawk generates a proposed shipment, it automatically compares and chooses the cheapest rate available from a wide selection of carriers. ShipHawk also offers the ability to compare rates between shipping carriers, to ensure you’re picking the best option and understand the different rates available. ShipHawk’s powerful rate comparison tools let you spend less time calculating shipping rates and save money on every shipment.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Rate Shopping for Shipping?\nSome key benefits of multi-carrier rate shopping are:\nGreater visibility = more ways to reduce shipping costs. With multi-carrier rate shopping, you are automatically able to compare different rates across carriers and service levels to ensure you get the cheapest and best rates per shipment \nIncreased reliability. When one carrier is experiencing large delays and is unable to make warehouse pick-ups, multi-carrier rate shopping gives you the flexibility to have a backup carrier to guarantee you can get shipments out the door and deliver on customer expectations\nImproved customer experience. Multi-carrier rate shopping empowers you to choose the best and most cost-effective carrier that will deliver your packages to customers in time they want and expect. So for example, upon checkout customers will only be shown the delivery time options, giving your warehouse employees the ability on the backend to select the carrier that will then deliver the package within the customer selected time-frame\nNow that you know some of the benefits of multi-carrier rate shopping and have seen it in action, schedule a call to speak with a shipping expert on our team to learn more about ShipHawk today. \nLEARN MORE\nYou ask, we answer.
