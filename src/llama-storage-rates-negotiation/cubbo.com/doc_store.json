International logistics encompass the intricate processes of importing and exporting goods via ocean, air, or road. Each day, sales are becoming more globally integrated.\\nNavigating the import and export of goods entails managing a complex landscape of regulations, compliance requirements, and laws. Despite the apparent challenges — which can be daunting — expanding your customer base is imperative for business growth, and international shipping provides access to a vast global audience. This underscores the future trajectory of e-commerce.\\n‍\\nKey elements of e-commerce fulfillment\\nCosts of global delivery\\nIn this section, it's essential to grasp International Commercial Terms, commonly known as Incoterms. Developed by the International Chamber of Commerce, these terms standardize responsibilities between buyers and sellers in global import and export trades. They aim to clarify the transfer of risks during logistics activities and establish a universally recognized framework of rules worldwide.\\nIn e-commerce sales, understanding different Incoterms is essential for negotiating product transport, whether for imports or exports, and making it accessible for all customers. Here are some of the key Incoterms to grasp:\\nEXW (Ex Works): The seller's obligation is to make the goods available at their premises, then the buyer bears all responsibility for costs and risks from that point forward. \\nFCA (Free Carrier): The seller is responsible for every part of the logistic movement, until the goods reach the destined port. \\nFOB (Freight on board): The seller has the responsibility until the goods are loaded onto the previously stated vessel, once this happens the buyer assumes responsibility and makes the customs clearance process.\\nCIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight): The seller assumes all obligations from when the ship leaves until it arrives into the port, seller is also responsible for paying the insurance to protect the goods. The buyer's responsibility starts when the goods are removed from the ship\\nCPT (Carriage Paid to ):For this one, the seller is going to take every cost, risk and possible losses until the goods are in their consumers hands.  \\nCIP (Carriage Insurance Paid To):The seller's responsibility starts when he pays freight charges and insurance, ensures the arrival of the vessel at the set location, his responsibility ends when the goods are delivered to the buyer or 3PL.\\nDDP (Delivered Duty Paid): This Incoterm states that the seller is responsible for covering all risks and costs from the point of origin (that includes, export and import duties, insurance, etc) up until it arrives at its destination.\\n‍\\nNavigation and Transportation for international ecommerce\\nThe right transportation for your product \\nWhen transporting goods from one location to another, selecting the appropriate mode of transportation is crucial for efficient logistics management.. Whether shipping by air, water, or ground, several factors influence this decision.\\nWhile cost-effectiveness is significant, it should not be the sole determining factor. Considerations such as the nature of the goods being transported, transit time requirements, integrated logistics capabilities, risk factors, and legal compliance are equally important.\\nChoosing the right transport mode involves balancing these factors to ensure timely delivery, minimize risks, comply with regulations, and optimize overall logistics efficiency. This holistic approach enhances operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction in the supply chain process.\\n‍\\nCustoms clearance, compliance and regulations \\nThe customs clearance process is pivotal in international shipping. It involves the gathering and submission of necessary paperwork by a customs broker to facilitate smooth clearance of goods through customs checkpoints. Businesses must adhere to distinct international shipping policies, as each country maintains specific regulations and laws.\\nNavigating international shipping is more complex than domestic logistics due to these varying regulations. Compliance with customs regulations is paramount to prevent delays and expedite market entry. By ensuring adherence to these requirements, businesses can effectively streamline their shipping processes and enhance operational efficiency in global markets.\\n‍\\nWarehousing location \\nWarehouses play a crucial role in shaping the customer shopping experience. Their strategic location and efficient management directly influence how quickly and reliably customers receive their products.\\nThe proximity of distribution centers is increasingly becoming a pivotal factor in determining future expansion goals. By strategically locating warehouses closer to customers, businesses can optimize delivery times, reduce shipping costs, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. This strategic approach not only improves operational efficiency but also strengthens competitiveness in the marketplace. Therefore, careful consideration of warehouse locations and effective management are essential for meeting customer expectations and achieving business growth objectives.\\n‍\\nDistribution and tracking of your product \\nSpeed wins\\nThe location of warehouses is critical for initiating efficient distribution processes, as delivery times directly impact customer satisfaction. Swift deliveries are pivotal in maintaining a competitive edge, particularly for brands expanding into new global markets.\\nFast delivery not only enhances customer satisfaction but also strengthens brand reputation and customer loyalty. By strategically locating warehouses closer to target markets, businesses can minimize delivery times, reduce shipping costs, and meet customer expectations more effectively. This proactive approach not only improves operational efficiency but also positions the brand favorably amidst competitors in the global marketplace. Therefore, prioritizing fast and reliable deliveries is essential for success in international expansion efforts.\\n‍\\nTracking of orders \\nTracking shipments is crucial in international logistics. Providing customers with the ability to monitor their packages instills confidence that their products are on their way and in safe hands, headed towards their doorstep. According to Dispatch Track, more than 90% of consumers want real-time tracking of their products, and 60% would reconsider buying from a brand if this doesn´t offer them this option.  Transparent and real-time tracking is indispensable for monitoring freight movement, a service we prioritize for all our customers at Cubbo.\\nEnsure peace of mind by using a tracking number to monitor your package throughout its journey.\\n‍\\nRisk management\\nIn international logistics, various risks can emerge across multiple stages, spanning legal and political considerations, infrastructure challenges, customs procedures, operational hurdles, and technological complexities.\\nNavigating these complexities with guidance from experts, such as those at Cubbo, ensures a safer operational environment. Their expertise equips businesses with the foresight to anticipate risks and proactively mitigate them.\\nEngaging a Third-Party Logistics company (3PL), which manages all logistical needs, offers significant benefits. It not only saves time and reduces costs but also minimizes potential risks throughout the supply chain process. This approach enhances the security and punctuality of product deliveries, reinforcing overall operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.\\n‍\\nConclusion\\nEven though international logistics management can represent a big operative challenge, there are several actions you could take to ensure operations work as smoothly as possible. This guide teaches you the boxes to check in managing your e-commerce global shippings. \\nStart by understanding the different costs that you could have and they represent: like EXW, FOB, CIF, and DPP. Then consult and choose a transportation method for your product; look for the right customs broker for clearing customs; pinpoint the perfect location for efficient deliveries; track products and strategize to be able to manage risks that might arise from these operations. \\nPartnering up with experts in logistics can always help you check these boxes better and faster.\\n‍\\nA footnote from Cubbo\\nCubbo is an e-commerce fulfillment company that helps you get rid of all the logistics management headaches that rise when entering a new country.

Direct to consumer sales via e-commerce channels are valued to be over $6.3 trillion in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 10.4%.\\nHowever, expanding internationally also presents unique challenges, including navigating complex regulations, customs, and taxes. For United States and global direct-to-consumer e-commerce brands looking to expand into Mexico, using an importer of record and merchant of record can be a game-changer, helping brands launch quickly and with lower shipping costs.\\n‍\\nREQUIREMENTS TO IMPORT INTO MEXICO\\nImporting and selling into Mexico is not without its challenges. Mexico has strict regulations regarding the importation of goods, including restrictions on certain products and requirements for specific permits and certifications.\\nThis would necessarily involve:\\n* Obtaining a tax identification number, known as Registro Federal de Contribuyentes (RFC)\\n* Registering your company with the Mexican Customs Agency\\n* Creating a local entity in Mexico\\n* Obtaining permits and certifications for cosmetic and food products through Mexican regulatory agencies such as COFEPRIS‍\\nFor example, the Mexican government requires importers to obtain a tax ID number known as a Registro Federal de Contribuyentes (RFC) and register with the Mexican Customs Agency (Aduanas).  This would necessarily imply having to set up a local entity in Mexico. In addition, certain products, such as food and cosmetics, require additional permits and certifications from Mexican regulatory agencies, such as the the COFEPRIS. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in costly fines and other penalties, including the seizure of the imported goods at customs.\\nMexico has complex tax laws, including value-added tax (VAT) and customs duties, which can vary depending on the type of product and its country of origin. Using an importer of record (IOR) and a merchant of record (MOR) can be an effective strategy for global direct-to-consumer e-commerce brands looking to expand into Mexico.\\n‍\\nWhat are IOR and MOR?\\nAn IOR is an external service provider that acts as a legal registered importer for your products.\\nBenefits of using an IOR:\\n* Foreign e-commerce brands can rely on the expertise of these service providers.\\n* They ensure compliance with local regulations and tax laws in Mexico. This includes obtaining necessary permits and certifications, handling customs clearance, and paying all required taxes and duties.\\nAn IOR is a third-party service provider that acts as the legal importer of record for your goods by assuming responsibility for the importation process, including compliance with local regulations, taxes, and customs clearance. By using an IOR, foreign e-commerce brands can rely on the expertise of these service providers to ensure compliance with local regulations and tax laws in Mexico. This includes obtaining the necessary permits and certifications, handling customs clearance, and paying all required taxes and duties.\\n‍\\nMORs, on the other hand, provide a similar service for the sale of goods. An MOR is an external service provider that acts as the merchant of record for its sales transactions in a foreign market.\\nThis includes:\\n* Collecting payments\\n* Processing refunds\\n* Ensuring compliance with local tax laws\\nAn MOR is a third-party service provider that acts as the merchant of record for your sales transactions in a foreign market. This includes collecting payments, processing refunds, and ensuring compliance with local tax laws. In Mexico, the MOR collects and remits VAT and other taxes to the Mexican government.\\nWithout these IOR and MOR services, a brand would have to navigate Mexico's complex legal and regulatory landscape, including obtaining necessary permits and licenses, complying with local tax laws, and navigating customs clearance procedures. These processes can be time-consuming and expensive, delaying the launch of a brand (taking between 12 to 18 months to launch) and potentially eating into its profits.\\n‍\\n3 advantages of working with an IOR and MOR in your company:\\n‍Compliance with Local Regulations: ‍\\nIORs and MORs ensure that your company complies with local regulations and tax laws in the foreign market. This includes obtaining the necessary permits and certifications, managing customs clearance, and paying all required taxes and tariffs.\\n‍Time and Cost Savings:\\nWithout IOR and MOR services, navigating the complex legal and regulatory landscape of a foreign market can be time-consuming and expensive. Working with these providers can save your company both time and money by streamlining the process of launching and selling products in a new market.\\n‍Expertise and Experience: I\\nOR and MOR providers have the expertise and experience needed to navigate the complexities of a foreign market. They can provide valuable guidance and support to your company, helping to ensure a successful expansion and growth in a new market.\\n‍\\nCubbo as an expansion partner‍\\nCubbo through its IOR and MOR services that form the core of its International Expansion team, has helped leading global e-commerce brands overcome the logistical and regulatory hurdles of entering the Mexican market, allowing them to focus on what they do best- selling their products.\\nOne of the primary benefits of using an IOR and MOR is that it can help US and European e-commerce brands launch in Mexico quickly. Without these services, a brand would need to navigate the complex legal and regulatory landscape of Mexico, including obtaining the necessary permits and licenses, complying with local tax laws, and navigating customs clearance procedures. These processes can be time-consuming and costly, delaying a brand's launch (it would take between 12-18 months to launch) and potentially eating into profits. By using an IOR and MOR, brands can bypass these challenges, allowing them to launch quickly and efficiently.  Typically, brands that Cubbo works with can launch between 30-60 days, depending on the type of product being imported and regulatory requirements that must be met.\\nAnother benefit of using an IOR and MOR is that it can lower shipping costs. Shipping products internationally can be expensive, with costs that can quickly add up for both the brand and the customer. By using an IOR and MOR, brands can take advantage of local shipping rates, as these services typically have established relationships with local carriers and logistics providers. This can help reduce shipping costs for both the brand and the customer, making products more accessible and affordable.\\nAdditionally, using an IOR and MOR can help US e-commerce brands comply with local regulations and tax laws. Mexico has strict regulations regarding the importation of goods, including restrictions on certain products and requirements for specific permits and certifications. These regulations can be challenging for brands to navigate, particularly if they are not familiar with the local legal and regulatory landscape. By using an IOR and MOR, brands can rely on the expertise of these services to ensure compliance with local regulations and tax laws, reducing the risk of costly fines or other penalties.\\nOverall, using an IOR and MOR can be an excellent strategy for direct-to-consumer (D2C) e-commerce brands looking to expand into Mexico. By outsourcing the importation and sales processes to third-party service providers, brands can launch quickly, reduce shipping costs, comply with local regulations, and establish a local presence. This can help brands tap into new markets, reach new customers, and grow their business over the long term.  Once your product has entered Mexico, Cubbo’s market leading fulfillment services can handle all aspects of fulfillment of your product inside the country.\\nIf you're a US or global direct-to-consumer e-commerce brand looking to expand into Mexico, it's important to work with a reputable and experienced IOR and MOR provider. Cubbo has a deep understanding of the local market and regulatory landscape, as well as established relationships with local carriers, logistics providers, and other service providers. Cubbo’s International Expansion team can offer flexible and customizable solutions that meet your specific needs, all with the goal of helping your brand grow and succeed in the Mexican market over the long term.\\nLATEST POSTS\\nFULFILLMENT\\nFulfillment en México: ¿Cómo funciona en las ciudades principales?\\nFULFILLMENT\\nEl rol de la seguridad en los servicios 3PL\\nLOGISTICA\\n5 retos de la

become a global phenomenon, allowing companies to expand their reach beyond national borders and tap into new markets.Direct to consumer sales via e-commerce channels are valued to be over $6.3 trillion in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 10.4%.However, expanding internationally also presents unique challenges, including navigating complex regulations, customs, and taxes.For United States and global direct-to-consumer e-commerce brands looking to expand into Mexico, using an importer of record and merchant of record can be a game-changer, helping brands launch quickly and with lower shipping costs.‍\\nREQUIREMENTS TO IMPORT INTO MEXICO\\nImporting and selling into Mexico is not without its challenges.Mexico has strict regulations regarding the importation of goods, including restrictions on certain products and requirements for specific permits and certifications.This would necessarily involve:\\n* Obtaining a tax identification number, known as Registro Federal de Contribuyentes (RFC)\\n* Registering your company with the Mexican Customs Agency\\n* Creating a local entity in Mexico\\n* Obtaining permits and certifications for cosmetic and food products through Mexican regulatory agencies such as COFEPRIS‍\\nFor example, the Mexican government requires importers to obtain a tax ID number known as a Registro Federal de Contribuyentes (RFC) and register with the Mexican Customs Agency (Aduanas).This would necessarily imply having to set up a local entity in Mexico.In addition, certain products, such as food and cosmetics, require additional permits and certifications from Mexican regulatory agencies, such as the the COFEPRIS.Failure to comply with these regulations can result in costly fines and other penalties, including the seizure of the imported goods at customs.Mexico has complex tax laws, including value-added tax (VAT) and customs duties, which can vary depending on the type of product and its country of origin.Using an importer of record (IOR) and a merchant of record (MOR) can be an effective strategy for global direct-to-consumer e-commerce brands looking to expand into Mexico.‍\\nWhat are IOR and MOR?An IOR is an external service provider that acts as a legal registered importer for your products.Benefits of using an IOR:\\n* Foreign e-commerce brands can rely on the expertise of these service providers.* They ensure compliance with local regulations and tax laws in Mexico.This includes obtaining necessary permits and certifications, handling customs clearance, and paying all required taxes and duties.An IOR is a third-party service provider that acts as the legal importer of record for your goods by assuming responsibility for the importation process, including compliance with local regulations, taxes, and customs clearance.By using an IOR, foreign e-commerce brands can rely on the expertise of these service providers to ensure compliance with local regulations and tax laws in Mexico.This includes obtaining the necessary permits and certifications, handling customs clearance, and paying all required taxes and duties.‍\\nMORs, on the other hand, provide a similar service for the sale of goods.An MOR is an external service provider that acts as the merchant of record for its sales transactions in a foreign market.This includes:\\n* Collecting payments\\n* Processing refunds\\n* Ensuring compliance with local tax laws\\nAn MOR is a third-party service provider that acts as the merchant of record for your sales transactions in a foreign market.This includes collecting payments, processing refunds, and ensuring compliance with local tax laws.In Mexico, the MOR collects and remits VAT and other taxes to the Mexican government.Without these IOR and MOR services, a brand would have to navigate Mexico's complex legal and regulatory landscape, including obtaining necessary permits and licenses, complying with local tax laws, and navigating customs clearance procedures.These processes can be time-consuming and expensive, delaying the launch of a brand (taking between 12 to 18 months to launch) and potentially eating into its profits.‍\\n3 advantages of working with an IOR and MOR in your company:\\n‍Compliance with Local Regulations: ‍\\nIORs and MORs ensure that your company complies with local regulations and tax laws in the foreign market.This includes obtaining the necessary permits and certifications, managing customs clearance, and paying all required taxes and tariffs.‍Time and Cost Savings:\\nWithout IOR and MOR services, navigating the complex legal and regulatory landscape of a foreign market can be time-consuming and expensive.Working with these providers can save your company both time and money by streamlining the process of launching and selling products in a new market.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"IuLBMxdAEuDDiMwBziCLxnN4/9cQqqd022ykq14st/k=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ee1d0c37-8816-407a-aaaf-3fb0bbbf1f3f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ee1d0c37-8816-407a-aaaf-3fb0bbbf1f3f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cubbo.com/posts/expand-your-brand-to-mexico-strategies-to-bring-your-e-commerce-to-mexican-territory\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"98c6a377-a979-4efe-86b7-74046e8e24dc\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cubbo.com/posts/expand-your-brand-to-mexico-strategies-to-bring-your-e-commerce-to-mexican-territory\"},\"hash\":\"we7poGQIGd1C39pRRPH+t/w4PN8hjjQzlCRIVsGrnJU=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d7f83565-eec3-448f-8cd9-8ae974973f3b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cubbo.com/posts/expand-your-brand-to-mexico-strategies-to-bring-your-e-commerce-to-mexican-territory\"},\"hash\":\"IuLBMxdAEuDDiMwBziCLxnN4/9cQqqd022ykq14st/k=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c1894ab6-7247-4846-907b-e7fd560249e3\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"hFwi9OiAF6+0V4JFZJkEIKra+LwvbhUQOWExqSzILWY=\"}},\"text\":\"These

guidance and support to your company, helping to ensure a successful expansion and growth in a new market.‍\\nCubbo as an expansion partner‍\\nCubbo through its IOR and MOR services that form the core of its International Expansion team, has helped leading global e-commerce brands overcome the logistical and regulatory hurdles of entering the Mexican market, allowing them to focus on what they do best- selling their products.One of the primary benefits of using an IOR and MOR is that it can help US and European e-commerce brands launch in Mexico quickly.Without these services, a brand would need to navigate the complex legal and regulatory landscape of Mexico, including obtaining the necessary permits and licenses, complying with local tax laws, and navigating customs clearance procedures.These processes can be time-consuming and costly, delaying a brand's launch (it would take between 12-18 months to launch) and potentially eating into profits.By using an IOR and MOR, brands can bypass these challenges, allowing them to launch quickly and efficiently.Typically, brands that Cubbo works with can launch between 30-60 days, depending on the type of product being imported and regulatory requirements that must be met.Another benefit of using an IOR and MOR is that it can lower shipping costs.Shipping products internationally can be expensive, with costs that can quickly add up for both the brand and the customer.By using an IOR and MOR, brands can take advantage of local shipping rates, as these services typically have established relationships with local carriers and logistics providers.This can help reduce shipping costs for both the brand and the customer, making products more accessible and affordable.Additionally, using an IOR and MOR can help US e-commerce brands comply with local regulations and tax laws.Mexico has strict regulations regarding the importation of goods, including restrictions on certain products and requirements for specific permits and certifications.These regulations can be challenging for brands to navigate, particularly if they are not familiar with the local legal and regulatory landscape.By using an IOR and MOR, brands can rely on the expertise of these services to ensure compliance with local regulations and tax laws, reducing the risk of costly fines or other penalties.Overall, using an IOR and MOR can be an excellent strategy for direct-to-consumer (D2C) e-commerce brands looking to expand into Mexico.By outsourcing the importation and sales processes to third-party service providers, brands can launch quickly, reduce shipping costs, comply with local regulations, and establish a local presence.This can help brands tap into new markets, reach new customers, and grow their business over the long term.Once your product has entered Mexico, Cubbo’s market leading fulfillment services can handle all aspects of fulfillment of your product inside the country.If you're a US or global
