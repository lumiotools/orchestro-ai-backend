Over the years, the business has seen steady growth, expanding from just a few employees to 25 and from several hundred orders per month to over 5,000 shipments to locations across the United States. To capitalize on business growth, Game Room Guys automated order fulfillment from order creation through to parcel shipping and delivery tracking using Descartes ShipRush combined with the NetSuite enterprise resource planning system.\\nThe Challenge: Processing and Accounting for Large Volumes of Complex Orders\\nIn 2008, Game Room Guys began its first ecommerce sales efforts. This catalyzed a new level of growth both for the company’s brick and mortar business and via eBay and Amazon marketplaces. Game Room Guys now offers thousands of products and processes over 5,000 orders per month, everything from ping pong paddles to arcade-quality games. Over the next 10 years, the company added 15,000 feet of warehouse space and opened a second 20,000 square foot showroom. This expansion created growing pains and, to better scale the business to the increasing opportunity, the company determined it needed a backend inventory system linked with shipping and fulfillment processes without investing in a full enterprise-grade system.\\nFrom a financial perspective, Descartes ShipRush™ makes it significantly easier to find the best carrier rate and delivery option for each shipment promptly, and it connects seamlessly with our NetSuite-based inventory management and accounting solution. It’s an extremely robust product that offers deep functionality for an excellent price point.\\n           – Eric Wildey, Chief Operating Officer, Game Room Guys \\nThe Solution: Reduce Shipping Costs and Streamline Order Fulfilment\\nBecause many buyers are one-time customers looking to furnish their game rooms, the company needed an efficient system to manage large volumes of unique, new customers with multiple orders from its extensive product inventory. Game Room Guys deployed the NetSuite enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for inventory management and accounting functions, and also to capture all sales orders, including from its own website and multiple online marketplaces.\\nSelected, in part, because of its seamless integration with NetSuite, the cloud-based Descartes ShipRush system serves as the backend order fulfillment and shipping solution for all sales channels—offering an end-to-end platform to rate shop, print labels, track shipments, process returns, and access customer information from a centralized dashboard. All orders now flow into NetSuite where fulfillment records are created and then automatically sent to Descartes ShipRush. After shipments are processed, details such as cost, tracking information and more are transmitted back to NetSuite.\\nGetting the best shipping rate per package is key to helping Game Room Guys offer free shipping and remain competitive. Previously, this was done by performing manual comparisons of individual carrier rates, which became extremely time-consuming and error-prone as order volumes continued to grow. Now, the company relies on the postage discounts and side-by-side carrier rate shopping capabilities in Descartes ShipRush, which not only improves productivity but also decreases costs. The company estimates a savings of at least 2 or 3 percent of their total expenses by rate shopping each shipment and choosing the best delivery option for every package. “From a financial perspective, if you are not shipping at the cheapest rate every time, you are giving away your margins,” explained Eric Wildey, COO at Game Room Guys.\\nWildey also notes that the solution’s rich feature set gives Game Room Guys additional shipping flexibility with the ability to rate shop new, built-in Freight and Less than Truckload (LTL) transportation options for oversized items or large shipments. Returns are also a simple matter with easy order verification and the ability to email shipping labels directly to customers. “The level of functionality in Descartes ShipRush for the cost is excellent. We have sophisticated capabilities like rate shopping and many other features that usually do not exist at this price point,” noted Wildey. Over time, Wildey says the company will continue to benefit from a more consistent fulfillment process, including using automation functions for best practices, and reducing the number of shipping clears needed to handle ongoing increases in order volumes.\\nThe Results\\nLower Shipping Costs\\nManually comparing carrier costs bogged Game Room Guys down and cost the company margin. Now, the company saves 2 to 3 percent per month with Descartes ShipRush discounts and by rate-shopping carriers for each package, side-by-side, evaluating delivery times and surcharges.\\n Greater Shipping Efficiency\\nNot only does Descartes ShipRush help Game Room Guys connect to internal systems and marketplaces, rate shop, print labels, track orders, and process returns, it also allows the company to use automation rules to ensure best practices with common types of shipments.\\n Enhanced Operational Performance\\nWith a high volume of complex transactions, Game Room Guys streamlined sales order processing, inventory management, order fulfillment and shipping, and accounting functions with the seamlessly integrated NetSuite and Descartes ShipRush solutions.\\n Freight and LTL Capabilities\\nIn the future, Game Room Guys plan to take advantage of the solution’s built-in Less than Truckload (LTL) shipping for more ways to save on parcel-size surcharges. Descartes ShipRush is the only parcel solution in this price point that offers built-in LTL and freight rate shopping.\\nJumping from several hundred orders/month to 5,000+ shipments across the U.S., ecommerce catalyzed a new level of growth for Gam\\nALSO OF INTEREST\\nMcCombs Supply Company Inc.\\nVideo: Wizard Distribution Greets Ecommerce Growth with Descartes ShipRush\\nCustomer Success - Game Room Guys Controlling Shipping Costs and Speeding Future Growth...\\nFooter menu\\nRESOURCES\\nAbout Descartes\\nCareers\\nGlobal User Group Conference\\nLogistics and Supply Chain Glossary\\nPrivacy\\nLegal\\nAccessibility\\nSitemap\\nSOLUTIONS\\nB2B Connectivity and Messaging\\nCustoms and Regulatory Compliance\\nBroker and Forwarder Enterprise Systems\\nGlobal Trade Intelligence\\nEcommerce Shipping and Fulfillment\\nTransportation Management\\nRouting, Mobile and Telematics\\nINDUSTRIES\\nRetail\\nManufacturing and Distribution\\nTransportation and Logistics\\nField Service and Sales\\nEcommerce\\nNorth America  +1 (800) 419-8495\\nInternational +1 (519) 746-8110\\ninfo@descartes.com\\n.cls-1{fill:#565656;}Descartes Blog\\n© 2024 THE DESCARTES SYSTEMS GROUP INC | ENABLE HIGH CONTRAST DISABLE HIGH CONTRAST\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"c5jrTUfimfcxKsv6gA2K29tNPLCxM/8KOYCOogrSVi4=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"1c3b813c-6ca0-480d-b04a-e01fcba82024":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1c3b813c-6ca0-480d-b04a-e01fcba82024\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.descartes.com/solutions/ecommerce-shipping-fulfillment/shipping-software\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Skip to main content\\nSecondary Menu\\nLANGUAGE\\nCONTACT\\nSUPPORT\\nLOGIN / REGISTER\\nMENU\\nContact Us\\nSearch\\nBreadcrumb\\nHome Solutions Ecommerce Shipping & Fulfillment\\nShipping Software\\nAroma Retail Scales Parcel Shipping\\n\\nAroma Retail scaled order volume from <10 orders/day to 200–300 orders daily and cut shipping costs with a streamlined process and Descartes XPS shipping software.  \\nREAD SUCCESS STORY\\nABOUT AROMA RETAIL SCALES PARCEL SHIPPING\\nAccelerated Peak Season Shipping\\n\\nAmerican Paper Optics scaled omnichannel shipping operations ahead of a major event-based sale to increase throughput and order fulfillment velocity, ensuring on-time orders.\\nREAD SUCCESS STORY\\nABOUT ACCELERATED PEAK SEASON SHIPPING\\nEcommerce Shipping Made Fast & Easy\\nShipping Automation\\nRate Shopping\\nShipment Tracking Visibility\\nMarketplace and Sales Channel Integration\\nReturns Management\\nInternational Shipping\\nCost-Effective Ecommerce Shipping & Visibility Regardless of Mode, Carrier or Scale\\nSell and ship anywhere\\nReduce shipping costs\\nOnboard new carriers and sales channels\\nEasily handle higher order volumes\\nBetter serve customers\\nReadily scale your business\\nSpeak with an Expert\\nOur Shipping Solutions at a Glance\\nDescartes ShipRush™\\nThe best scalable multi-carrier ecommerce shipping solution for fast-growing ecommerce brands.\\nLEARN MORE\\nABOUT DESCARTES SHIPRUSH™\\nDescartes XPS™\\nThe best free multi-carrier ecommerce shipping solution for small to mid-sized businesses.\\nLEARN MORE\\nABOUT DESCARTES XPS™\\nDescartes Shipping for UPS\\nUsed by thousands of companies, Descartes Shipping™ Solutions for UPS is the fastest way to rate, ship, and track with UPS.\\nLEARN MORE\\nABOUT DESCARTES SHIPPING FOR UPS\\nDescartes OzLink® Shipping for NetSuite\\nFully integrated, cost effective shipping & visibility regardless of mode, carrier or scale\\nLEARN MORE\\nABOUT DESCARTES OZLINK® SHIPPING FOR NETSUITE\\nDescartes White Label Shipping\\nFast and easy- to-deploy options for brand personalization or embedding shipping capabilities within the user interface of any web application\\nLEARN MORE\\nABOUT DESCARTES WHITE LABEL SHIPPING\\nNetSuite Shipping Solutions\\nDescartes multi-carrier shipping solutions integrate with NetSuite, providing access to shipping label printing, powerful business automation rules, rate shopping, discounted shipping rates, and more.\\nDescartes OzLink Shipping for NetSuite\\nDescartes ShipRush for NetSuite\\nDescartes XPS Ship for NetSuite\\n— Lana Appleby, Technical Product Manager, Dahlgren Duck\\n“With the Descartes solution driving order fulfillment across six shipping stations in our 25,000 sq. ft.

The solution provides line-item-level visibility across multiple modes of transportation by connecting trading partners, enabling them to share data (such as purchase order, advanced shipment notices, and shipment status messages), and monitoring the order process. Overall, the solution helps reduce shipment variability and costs associated with obsolete inventories.\\nDescartes' Visibility solution leverages the power of the Descartes Global Logistics Network (GLN) to provide the connectivity necessary to gain line-item visibility. Over 6,000 connected companies use the Descartes GLN to better manage logistics processes.\\nA multi-national enterprise, the supply chain of the Hitachi group is very complex in terms of products, modes and players. After a successful pilot in November 2007, Hitachi selected Descartes' Visibility solution as one of the important components in its total industrial solution spectrum, to provide supply chain visibility especially on key milestones, to help reduce inventory safety stock by better collaboration among partners, and to improve service levels by measuring quantitative key performance indicators on system and logistics performance.\\n``We believe that Descartes' Visibility solution enables organizations to proactively manage shipments and improve the efficiency of the shipment management process,'' said Kenji Yasuda, Director at the Information & Telecommunication Systems of Hitachi Ltd. ``The flexibility of Descartes' Visibility solution allows companies to monitor components of a purchase order along the supply chain. This is very important to companies who have de-assembly and re-assembly activities in the logistics process and sometimes even ship different components of a purchase order from different places and times. We can also customize the list of milestones to trace and alert on these items when there is exception.''\\n``Our focus is to help our customers standardize business process and improve the efficiency of the shipment management process,'' said Dejin Liu, Director of Asia Operation of Descartes. ``With the flexibility in connectivity of our GLN, we can quickly bring trading partners into a single information portal with minimal effort from our customers. Our customers are then able to maximize the result of collaboration by using various functions provided by Descartes' Visibility solution, such as track and trace, reporting, alert and comment for better information and visibility of incoming and outgoing deliveries. We empower our customers to have better control over their inventories ultimately improving customer service and efficiencies.''\\nAbout the Information & Telecommunication Systems of Hitachi Ltd.\\nThe Information & Telecommunication Systems segment is active in a wide range of areas, from hardware such as communications infrastructure, hard disk drives and other storage products, to the provision of systems integration services based on these products and consulting services.

Descartes ShipRush consolidates and executes orders for Wizard by integrating with the company’s online storefronts in the U.S. and more than 25 international distributors.\\n“With a large inventory of rotating merchandise, we have a wide variety of parcel shapes and sizes that need to be shipped domestically and internationally, which creates a complex shipping challenge. As online sales began to flourish, we quickly became bogged down by manual order processing and shipping, even while we added more people,” said Billy Carmen, owner of Wizard Distribution. “By automating fulfillment with Descartes ShipRush, we’re now easily processing 30 to 40 packages per day and over 1,000 per month and we’re accomplishing this with two people, instead of six. It’s been a boon to customer service, and it has given us a path to a sustainable and profitable home-based business.”\\nThe cloud-based Descartes ShipRush solution helps small-to-medium ecommerce businesses, like Wizard Distribution, and omnichannel retailers ship parcels efficiently and cost-effectively. Using the system, companies can automatically receive customer orders from multiple carts, marketplaces and CRM/accounting solutions in one dashboard; compare carrier rates and delivery options in real-time; print shipping labels for FedEx, UPS, USPS, and other major U.S. and global carriers; and track shipments through to final delivery. Integrated with over 70 business systems, including leading ERP, ecommerce, and supply chain systems, Descartes ShipRush helps to streamline order fulfillment and reduce shipping costs.\\n“We’re pleased that Descartes ShipRush is helping Wizard Distribution thrive through a high level of customer service and cost-effective shipping,” said Rafael Zimberoff, VP Product Management at Descartes. “As ecommerce businesses grow, diverse sales channels, manual procedures, and more can strain operations, leading to poor service and financial performance. By unifying order management and streamlining fulfillment practices all the way through delivery, Descartes ShipRush helps ecommerce companies run more efficiently and better serve their customers.”\\nA video case study for Wizard Distribution is available here.\\nAbout Wizard Distribution\\nWizard Distribution is a product manufacturing and distribution company that serves various niche markets providing products to retailers in the USA, Canada, Australia and more.

ShipRush™\\nBreadcrumb\\nHome Resources Knowledge Center\\nFounded in 2001, Game Room Guys is a Michigan-based family business that helps consumers create entertainment spaces in their own homes with hundreds of fun offerings, including pinball machines, arcade games, pool tables, furniture, and other supplies.Over the years, the business has seen steady growth, expanding from just a few employees to 25 and from several hundred orders per month to over 5,000 shipments to locations across the United States.To capitalize on business growth, Game Room Guys automated order fulfillment from order creation through to parcel shipping and delivery tracking using Descartes ShipRush combined with the NetSuite enterprise resource planning system.The Challenge: Processing and Accounting for Large Volumes of Complex Orders\\nIn 2008, Game Room Guys began its first ecommerce sales efforts.This catalyzed a new level of growth both for the company’s brick and mortar business and via eBay and Amazon marketplaces.Game Room Guys now offers thousands of products and processes over 5,000 orders per month, everything from ping pong paddles to arcade-quality games.Over the next 10 years, the company added 15,000 feet of warehouse space and opened a second 20,000 square foot showroom.This expansion created growing pains and, to better scale the business to the increasing opportunity, the company determined it needed a backend inventory system linked with shipping and fulfillment processes without investing in a full enterprise-grade system.From a financial perspective, Descartes ShipRush™ makes it significantly easier to find the best carrier rate and delivery option for each shipment promptly, and it connects seamlessly with our NetSuite-based inventory management and accounting solution.It’s an extremely robust product that offers deep functionality for an excellent price point.– Eric Wildey, Chief Operating Officer, Game Room Guys \\nThe Solution: Reduce Shipping Costs and Streamline Order Fulfilment\\nBecause many buyers are one-time customers looking to furnish their game rooms, the company needed an efficient system to manage large volumes of unique, new customers with multiple orders from its extensive product inventory.Game Room Guys deployed the NetSuite enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for inventory management and accounting functions, and also to capture all sales orders, including from its own website and multiple online marketplaces.Selected, in part, because of its seamless integration with NetSuite, the cloud-based Descartes ShipRush system serves as the backend order fulfillment and shipping solution for all sales channels—offering an end-to-end platform to rate shop, print labels, track shipments, process returns, and access customer information from a centralized dashboard.All orders now flow into NetSuite where fulfillment records are created and then automatically sent to Descartes ShipRush.After shipments are processed, details such as cost, tracking information and more are transmitted back to NetSuite.Getting the best shipping rate per package is key to helping Game Room Guys offer free shipping and remain competitive.Previously, this was done by performing manual comparisons of individual carrier rates, which became extremely time-consuming and error-prone as order volumes continued to grow.Now, the company relies on the postage discounts and side-by-side carrier rate shopping capabilities in Descartes ShipRush, which not only improves productivity but also decreases costs.The company estimates a savings of at least 2 or 3 percent of their total expenses by rate shopping each shipment and choosing the best delivery option for every package.“From a financial perspective, if you are not shipping at the cheapest rate every time, you are giving away your margins,” explained Eric Wildey, COO at Game Room Guys.Wildey also notes that the solution’s rich feature set gives Game Room Guys additional shipping flexibility with the ability to rate shop new, built-in Freight and Less than Truckload (LTL) transportation options for oversized items or large shipments.Returns are also a simple matter with easy order verification and the ability to email shipping labels directly to customers.“The level of functionality in Descartes ShipRush for the cost is excellent.We have sophisticated capabilities like rate shopping and many other features that usually do not exist at this price point,” noted Wildey.Over time, Wildey says the company will continue to benefit from a more consistent fulfillment process, including using automation functions for best practices, and reducing the number of shipping clears needed to handle ongoing increases in order volumes.The

Partner Companies\\nDescartes Systems Group, a global on-demand software-as-a-service (SaaS) logistics solutions provider, announced that, after a successful pilot project, it has formed an alliance with the Information & Telecommunication System Group of Hitachi Ltd.to promote and use Descartes' Global Logistics Network with its group companies of manufacturers and logistics service providers.Descartes' Visibility solution helps improve logistics efficiency by enabling companies to see potential order failures before they happen.The solution provides line-item-level visibility across multiple modes of transportation by connecting trading partners, enabling them to share data (such as purchase order, advanced shipment notices, and shipment status messages), and monitoring the order process.Overall, the solution helps reduce shipment variability and costs associated with obsolete inventories.Descartes' Visibility solution leverages the power of the Descartes Global Logistics Network (GLN) to provide the connectivity necessary to gain line-item visibility.Over 6,000 connected companies use the Descartes GLN to better manage logistics processes.A multi-national enterprise, the supply chain of the Hitachi group is very complex in terms of products, modes and players.After a successful pilot in November 2007, Hitachi selected Descartes' Visibility solution as one of the important components in its total industrial solution spectrum, to provide supply chain visibility especially on key milestones, to help reduce inventory safety stock by better collaboration among partners, and to improve service levels by measuring quantitative key performance indicators on system and logistics performance.``We believe that Descartes' Visibility solution enables organizations to proactively manage shipments and improve the efficiency of the shipment management process,'' said Kenji Yasuda, Director at the Information & Telecommunication Systems of Hitachi Ltd.``The flexibility of Descartes' Visibility solution allows companies to monitor components of a purchase order along the supply chain.This is very important to companies who have de-assembly and re-assembly activities in the logistics process and sometimes even ship different components of a purchase order from different places and times.We can also customize the list of milestones to trace and alert on these items when there is exception.''\\n``Our focus is to help our customers standardize business process and improve the efficiency of the shipment management process,'' said Dejin Liu, Director of Asia Operation of Descartes.``With the flexibility in connectivity of our GLN, we can quickly bring trading partners into a single information portal with minimal effort from our customers.Our customers are then able to maximize the result of collaboration by using various functions provided by Descartes' Visibility solution, such as track and trace, reporting, alert and comment for better information and visibility of incoming and outgoing deliveries.We empower our customers to have better control over their inventories ultimately improving customer service and efficiencies.''\\nAbout the Information & Telecommunication Systems of Hitachi Ltd.The Information & Telecommunication Systems segment is active in a wide range of areas, from hardware such as communications infrastructure, hard disk drives and other storage products, to the provision of systems integration services based on these products and consulting services.The Hitachi Group leverages these IT capabilities to create new value for people everywhere.For more information visit their web site www.hitachi.com/IR-e/business/segment/info/index.html.\\nAbout Hitachi

(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Descartes Systems Group (Nasdaq:DSGX) (TSX:DSG), the global leader in uniting logistics-intensive businesses in commerce, announced that Michigan-based Wizard Distribution is using the cloud-based Descartes ShipRush™ solution to streamline the fulfillment of ecommerce orders.Descartes ShipRush consolidates and executes orders for Wizard by integrating with the company’s online storefronts in the U.S.and more than 25 international distributors.“With a large inventory of rotating merchandise, we have a wide variety of parcel shapes and sizes that need to be shipped domestically and internationally, which creates a complex shipping challenge.As online sales began to flourish, we quickly became bogged down by manual order processing and shipping, even while we added more people,” said Billy Carmen, owner of Wizard Distribution.“By automating fulfillment with Descartes ShipRush, we’re now easily processing 30 to 40 packages per day and over 1,000 per month and we’re accomplishing this with two people, instead of six.It’s been a boon to customer service, and it has given us a path to a sustainable and profitable home-based business.”The cloud-based Descartes ShipRush solution helps small-to-medium ecommerce businesses, like Wizard Distribution, and omnichannel retailers ship parcels efficiently and cost-effectively.Using the system, companies can automatically receive customer orders from multiple carts, marketplaces and CRM/accounting solutions in one dashboard; compare carrier rates and delivery options in real-time; print shipping labels for FedEx, UPS, USPS, and other major U.S.and global carriers; and track shipments through to final delivery.Integrated with over 70 business systems, including leading ERP, ecommerce, and supply chain systems, Descartes ShipRush helps to streamline order fulfillment and reduce shipping costs.“We’re pleased that Descartes ShipRush is helping Wizard Distribution thrive through a high level of customer service and cost-effective shipping,” said Rafael Zimberoff, VP Product Management at Descartes.“As ecommerce businesses grow, diverse sales channels, manual procedures, and more can strain operations, leading to poor service and financial performance.By unifying order management and streamlining fulfillment practices all the way through delivery, Descartes ShipRush helps ecommerce companies run more efficiently and better serve their customers.”A video case study for Wizard Distribution is available here.About Wizard Distribution\\nWizard Distribution is a product
