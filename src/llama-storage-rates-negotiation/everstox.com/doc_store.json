Cost pressure for eCommerce decision makers will face high cost structures of providers. This could lead to a very unhealthy negotiation cycle sacrificing service quality and customer experience for costs. At everstox, we’ll avoid this by delivering network optimization and software solutions to increase efficiency and reduce costs for both. |\\nLogistics costs insights from Boris Bösch, Co-CEO at everstox\\nReducing costs without losing operational excellence? That’s possible. Simply benchmark your current spend to the everstox database with warehousing, fulfillment and shipping rates from >1,000 quotes for different eCom use cases and target markets. Our beneficial rates enable your business to reduce logistics costs in 2025.\\nBenchmark logistics costs\\nDirect logistics costs vs. total logistics costs definition\\nUnderstanding types of logistics costs\\nGiven the uncertainty in the market, it’s very reasonable to focus on efficiency and cost reductions of the eCommerce business and thus within logistics, making up about 20% of eCommerce sales. Also, it’s key to look at total logistics costs instead of only at the direct logistics costs since we know that logistics plays a huge role in customer experience and overall eCommerce operations efficiency.\\nDefinition: What are logistics costs?\\nDirect logistics costs are referred to as rates for freight, warehousing, fulfillment, and shipping. Essentially, the pricing and invoices received from 3PLs and carriers when outsourcing logistics or the comparable direct costs when managing in-house logistics.\\nMeanwhile, total logistics costs go beyond what we mentioned above. They also include manual work that requires managing day-to-day operations (e.g. operations and customer service team costs) and all indirect costs resulting from lack of service quality (e.g. higher return rates, lower repurchase rates, etc.)\\nThe difference between total logistics costs and direct logistics costs is particularly important. That is, reducing direct costs does not necessarily lower the total logistics costs. Lowest-cost fulfillment service or carrier service providers often don’t excel in service quality and precision, which derives additional internal manual work and also threatens the customer experience. Instead of blindly aiming for the lowest-cost procurement rates, CFOs and COOs could try to optimize total logistics costs.\\n| Managing total logistics costs and operational efficiency is key for us in 2025. However, we prioritize those initiatives that generate logistics savings and improve our customer experience at the same time. E.g. local fulfillment centers in Europe, the UK and the US and a dynamic multi-carrier-selection with everstox help us to reduce shipping costs while offering a faster and more reliable delivery to our customers. |\\nLogistics costs insights from João Martins, CFO at Hey Harper\\nWhat will happen to direct logistics costs in 2025?\\nUnderstanding current logistics prices\\nIn 2025, direct logistics costs are expected to increase due to factors such as labor shortages, rising fuel prices, and supply chain challenges. Labor shortages, especially in areas like drivers and warehouse workers, will continue to push wages higher, raising overall logistics expenses. Automation can help mitigate this, but it requires significant upfront investment.\\nAt the same time, transportation costs will rise due to higher energy prices, driven by geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations. The use of logistics software for automation, real-time tracking, and route optimization can reduce costs but comes with initial setup expenses. Additionally, cross-border logistics may become more expensive due to regulatory changes, pushing companies to rely more on regional logistics hubs.\\n| Logistics service price increases inherit a time lag due to contract structures. Most contracts include annual price reviews that will come up throughout the year for eCommerce businesses. Any eCommerce decision maker should review their set-up now to avoid being surprised by a cost increase in 2025. |\\nLogistics costs insights from Johannes Tress, Co-CEO at everstox\\nWhat are the drivers behind increasing direct logistics costs?\\nThe drivers behind increasing logistics costs are systemic and will hit every eCommerce brand and operational 3PL or carrier equally. In order to better understand how to reduce logistics costs, we take a closer look at all cost categories. We separate the inbound and warehousing, outbound and fulfillment rates, and last-mile shipping rates in more detail below.\\nInbound, warehousing, outbound and fulfillment costs 2025\\nRising warehouse labor costs are a key element of increased warehouse & fulfillment costs, with year-on-year wage growth running in excess of 20% over the last two years in the US. This has risen from a 5% to 10% range from 2000 to 2015. Similar trends can also be found across Europe. For example, the minimum wage has risen in Germany and the overall shortage of warehouse labor increases labor rates.\\nWarehouse labor costs should mainly impact processing rates including inbounding, pick&pack, return handling, etc. Therefore, a high standard of intralogistics automation will be key. We expect storage rates to be more stable. Many 3PLs & eCommerce businesses invested in warehouse space over the last years which is now, given the recent market slowdown, available at good rates.\\nThe increased energy costs also put pressure on warehousing and fulfillment costs due to the expenses on essentials like lighting, temperature control, intralogistics automation and similar facilities. Additionally, resource costs such as wood for pallets or paper for cartons and filling materials have already been increasing significantly in the last years with likely further increases in 2025.\\nLast-mile delivery – Carrier and shipping costs 2025\\nBesides labor shortage and energy costs, overall inflation over the last few years has also been the key driver behind increasing carrier and shipping costs. All major carriers including DHL, UPS, and FedEx had significant price increases between 6.9% to 7.9% in the last years indicating the direction for overall market levels.\\n| Looking at the overall dynamics of direct logistics costs, I’d recommend a CFO to put optimization of carrier and shipping costs on top of their agenda. E.g. in Germany given a domestic parcel rate of ca. €3 / international parcel rate of ca. €6, a 10% cost increase / optimization delivers €0.30ct to €0.60ct in savings potential. This is very hard to squeeze out of €1 to €2 avg. total fulfillment costs / order with thin margins. |\\nLogistics costs insights from Boris Bösch, Co-CEO at everstox\\n6 pro-tips on how to reduce logistics costs in 2025\\nGiven the trade-off between direct logistics costs and total logistics costs, we’re focusing on 6 key tips that will help you to optimize your total logistics costs without sacrificing, potentially even improving, customer experience and logistics quality.\\nBenchmark your current logistics costs and identify savings potentials\\nTip #1 to reduce logistics costs\\nLogistics is a thin-margin business. It’s impossible to negotiate cost savings when you’re already paying fair market rates for quality services without sacrificing heavily on indirect logistics costs. It’s key to benchmark your costs and to identify the right cost buckets where you’re potentially overpaying because of your overall supply chain set-up and design.\\nAlso, you should spend your time and efforts on cost optimization on the right things. everstox can support you on this exercise with a database of >1,000 quotes for warehousing & fulfillment services in different products & markets and negotiated carrier rates with all major carriers incl. DHL, UPS, FedEx, etc.\\nRequest your benchmark here\\n| everstox helped us reduce our direct logistics cost by 20-30% compared to standard market offerings. What’s more, we now expanded to 4 additional markets with 4 local warehouses and fulfillment solutions managed, monitored and coordinated with only 1 integrated platform. Thanks to everstox, we can easily track inventory flows, act quickly to avoid stock disruptions and at the same time reduce overhead for our operational team. In short: we are able to drastically reduce indirect costs to manage operations, even though we scaled our sales 5 times. |\\nLogistics costs insights from João Martins, CFO at Hey Harper\\nUse a specialized 3PL\\nTip #2 to reduce logistics costs\\nWork with a specialized 3PL that already understands your product and processes and serves within the warehouse already similar projects. By doing so, businesses can reduce fixed costs and overall fulfillment costs from 3PL’s expertise in every market scenario. According to McKinsey, specialized fulfillment drives cost savings of 7-9% in comparison to mainstream fulfillment.\\nAnd it seems like they are more attractive to eCommerce businesses than ever. If you fit well into already established 3PL processes for other customers, you can benefit from their economies of scale and get access to attractive rates. 3PLs usually can afford to invest more in warehouse automation across their customer base, particularly important in light of increasing warehouse labor costs.\\nLearn more\\n| Given the current market environment, most eCommerce businesses will probably run below forecasts and thus 3PLs mostly (over)invested in capacities recently. The market timing in early 2025 will be good for eCommerce businesses to get access to attractive rates if they identify the perfectly fitting 3PL capacities. |\\nLogistics costs insights from Johannes Tress, Co-CEO at everstox\\nOptimize carrier costs and select dynamic shipping methods\\nTip #3 to reduce logistics costs\\nWorking with a partner like everstox that bundles a high amount of parcel volumes across their customer base can grant access to better rates through scale effects for the same carrier service levels. Also, everstox enables merchants of all sizes to follow a multi-carrier approach. There is no universal best-performing and most cost-efficient carrier, hence leading brands work with multiple partners for different product categories, target markets and service levels (e.g. Zalando has 38 parcel carriers across all markets).\\nWithin this multi-carrier set up a tech-driven dynamic carrier selection can be applied to optimize costs by product categories and target markets. E.g. everstox software enables you to intelligently choose the most cost-efficient solution between leading carriers like DHL, GLS, UPS, or FedEx for every order depending on parcel weight, dimension and destination.\\nLearn more\\nOptimize your fulfillment center footprint and use multi-warehousing\\nTip #4 to reduce logistics costs\\nMany eCommerce businesses are significantly overpaying for logistics because of structural reasons in their logistics footprint. Often the main reason for the location of their main fulfillment center is that it’s close to their HQ vs. optimization for logistics costs. \\nOftentimes, there’s significant savings potential in choosing a location that is optimizing the equation between distance to production and main order destinations. Plus, e.g. in light of minimum wage increases close-to-border locations in Eastern Europe are often a chance to reduce logistics costs.\\nDepending on the order structure, decentralizing fulfillment to multiple local warehouses often generates huge cost savings in carrier and shipping costs.\\nLearn more\\nReduce manual work in day-to-day operations\\nTip #5 to reduce logistics costs\\nRising direct logistics costs can (partly) be offset with driving automation and reducing unnecessary manual work and labor across day-to-day operations.\\nThis requires optimizing efficiency in day-to-day interaction between your customer service, operations team and your warehousing, fulfillment and shipping operations.\\nLearn more\\n| Thanks to the everstox technology, automation and digital workflows, we’ve been able to expand to multiple warehouse locations across Europe, the UK and the US and to multiple carrier service offerings including DHL, Warenpost, DHL Express, UPS or FedEx while keeping our workload in operations and customer service teams at efficient levels. |\\nLogistics costs insights from João Martins, CFO at Hey Harper\\nRun detailed cost audits\\nTip #6 to reduce logistics costs\\nStay in control of all your costs and pay for what you really get. Particularly carrier invoices can often be very intransparent with thousands of orders every month with different dimensions, weight categories, destinations, and various surcharges. It is very common that eCommerce businesses are overbilled by service providers without notice. \\nHowever, it’s also impossible to review every invoice and every parcel sent line by line. It’s key to develop automated cost audit processes to stay on top of your expenses and within your budget. For example, everstox provides parcel audit services for all everstox shipping offerings to ensure customers that they only pay for what they get.\\nLearn more\\n| everstox identifies significant cost claims on almost every carrier invoice. It’s a huge cost and time saving for us that we don’t have to do those cost audits ourselves. |\\nLogistics costs insights from João Martins, CFO at Hey Harper\\nKey takeaways – Optimizing logistics costs in 2025\\nTo be clear, 2025 will be a challenging year for eCommerce business CFOs and COOs. Keeping total logistics costs under control, while direct logistics costs around warehousing, fulfillment and shipping will likely increase at double-digit rates, and still delivering on customer experience is a huge mountain to climb.\\nThus, it’s key to benchmark your current logistics setup and identify the right initiatives to optimize your setup now.

Read the press release on how Gründl skyrockets D2C commerce.\\nJuly 5, 2021\\nTeam everstox\\nPress Release\\nThe Munich-based logistics specialists are taking over product fulfillment\\nfor the new D2C business division of the family-run medium-sized enterprise.\\nMunich, July 5, 2021 – everstox, developer and operator of the Logistics-as-a-Service platform of the same name, is pleased to announce a new customer from the textile industry. The family-owned SME Gründl is handling the shipping and warehouse logistics of its newly established Direct-to-Consumer business entirely via the everstox platform and its Europe-wide network of qualified logistics partners.\\nThe well-established family business Gründl – headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria – is a leading European supplier of hand knitting yarns, wool and haberdashery. Since its foundation in the 1920s, the medium-sized company has continued to develop successfully and is now established as a modern top specialist in the textile industry. For its recently launched D2C distribution channel, Gründl was looking for a reliable partner to handle warehousing and fulfillment operations. “Our in-house team has very good, established logistics processes for the B2B sector. However, the challenges of e-commerce fulfillment, which is new to us, are fundamentally different – and quickly take you to your own limits,” recalls Sebastian Müller, Marketing and Sales Manager at Gründl. This is because the end customer business is characterized by individual parcel shipments with many, individual subtleties that are centrally important for a great unpacking experience.\\nState-of-the-art technology enables an interconnected logistics network\\n“everstox was able to master these challenges without any problems and enabled us to perfectly set up the distribution logistics of our new D2C division within two weeks,” Müller is pleased to say. “We were immediately convinced because, unlike many other providers we know from previous projects, the Logistics-as-a-Service solution from everstox is structured in a completely transparent way. And the operational implementation also worked smoothly right from the start.”\\nToday, Gründl benefits above all from easy access to highly qualified, specialized logistics partners from the Europe-wide everstox network. Within the interconnected network, Gründl can easily find the right partners who are precisely tailored to the needs of the medium-sized family business in terms of product storage, order fulfillment and shipping. Another plus point is the everstox Cloud Software: With the powerful software, all distribution logistics operations can be automated, monitored and managed. As a result, the family business not only has all order, fulfillment and warehouse data in real-time available in a clear dashboard, but also can add and edit new stock-keeping-units. But there’s many more features available for Gründl, for example: Tracking and tracing of orders and service level agreements, refilling stock or setting up automatic alerts to prevent delivery bottlenecks at the push of a button.\\nWhat’s more, Gründl’s planned expansion of the D2C business into other European countries can also be mapped using the Logistics-as-a-Service platform: Thanks to the everstox solution, Gründl can seamlessly integrate new warehouse locations in order to reduce shipping costs and speed up order delivery with local fulfillment across Europe – without any additional integration effort.\\nFind more information about Gründl.\\nAbout everstox\\neverstox is a Munich-based Logistics as a Service (LaaS) company founded in 2019 by Boris Bösch, Felix Haberland and Johannes Tress.

vs. total logistics costs definition\\nUnderstanding types of logistics costs\\nGiven the uncertainty in the market, it’s very reasonable to focus on efficiency and cost reductions of the eCommerce business and thus within logistics, making up about 20% of eCommerce sales.Also, it’s key to look at total logistics costs instead of only at the direct logistics costs since we know that logistics plays a huge role in customer experience and overall eCommerce operations efficiency.Definition: What are logistics costs?Direct logistics costs are referred to as rates for freight, warehousing, fulfillment, and shipping.Essentially, the pricing and invoices received from 3PLs and carriers when outsourcing logistics or the comparable direct costs when managing in-house logistics.Meanwhile, total logistics costs go beyond what we mentioned above.They also include manual work that requires managing day-to-day operations (e.g.operations and customer service team costs) and all indirect costs resulting from lack of service quality (e.g.higher return rates, lower repurchase rates, etc.)\\nThe difference between total logistics costs and direct logistics costs is particularly important.That is, reducing direct costs does not necessarily lower the total logistics costs.Lowest-cost fulfillment service or carrier service providers often don’t excel in service quality and precision, which derives additional internal manual work and also threatens the customer experience.Instead of blindly aiming for the lowest-cost procurement rates, CFOs and COOs could try to optimize total logistics costs.| Managing total logistics costs and operational efficiency is key for us in 2025.However, we prioritize those initiatives that generate logistics savings and improve our customer experience at the same time.E.g.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"M2+m94UnD8PrdVFmoGl3yP9j8UPMD8Uu0+qtn9CjVKw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"059184de-49a7-4a3b-b96a-d95d35e12de3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"059184de-49a7-4a3b-b96a-d95d35e12de3\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://everstox.com/logistics-insights/reduce-logistics-costs-in-2025/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"4eb0db91-de94-43f4-8c18-1aca1b156fe0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://everstox.com/logistics-insights/reduce-logistics-costs-in-2025/\"},\"hash\":\"Vw+0UK1noUc+P7eIPXoj89X1mKq97EM+wRkg3Bjc2+w=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"b6f8795d-81cd-4f52-9e52-c5a4d6c89a19\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://everstox.com/logistics-insights/reduce-logistics-costs-in-2025/\"},\"hash\":\"M2+m94UnD8PrdVFmoGl3yP9j8UPMD8Uu0+qtn9CjVKw=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e4d48599-3664-4579-9e66-193102c5a823\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Uf+rv/6+BetjPyAkqYZeTP8joTucrdh8Ntou7+NXsA8=\"}},\"text\":\"Meanwhile,

logistics prices\\nIn 2025, direct logistics costs are expected to increase due to factors such as labor shortages, rising fuel prices, and supply chain challenges.Labor shortages, especially in areas like drivers and warehouse workers, will continue to push wages higher, raising overall logistics expenses.Automation can help mitigate this, but it requires significant upfront investment.At the same time, transportation costs will rise due to higher energy prices, driven by geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations.The use of logistics software for automation, real-time tracking, and route optimization can reduce costs but comes with initial setup expenses.Additionally, cross-border logistics may become more expensive due to regulatory changes, pushing companies to rely more on regional logistics hubs.| Logistics service price increases inherit a time lag due to contract structures.Most contracts include annual price reviews that will come up throughout the year for eCommerce businesses.Any eCommerce decision maker should review their set-up now to avoid being surprised by a cost increase in 2025.|\\nLogistics costs insights from Johannes Tress, Co-CEO at everstox\\nWhat are the drivers behind increasing direct logistics costs?The drivers behind increasing logistics costs are systemic and will hit every eCommerce brand and operational 3PL or carrier equally.In order to better understand how to reduce logistics costs, we take a closer look at all cost categories.We separate the inbound and warehousing, outbound and fulfillment rates, and last-mile shipping rates in more detail below.Inbound, warehousing, outbound and fulfillment costs 2025\\nRising warehouse labor costs are a key element of increased warehouse & fulfillment costs, with year-on-year wage growth running in excess of 20% over the last two years in the US.This has risen from a 5% to 10% range from 2000 to 2015.Similar trends can also be found across Europe.For example, the minimum wage has risen in Germany and the overall shortage of warehouse labor increases labor rates.Warehouse labor costs should mainly impact processing rates including inbounding, pick&pack, return handling, etc. Therefore, a high standard of intralogistics automation will be key.We expect storage rates to be more stable.Many 3PLs & eCommerce businesses invested in warehouse space over the last years which is now, given the recent market slowdown, available at good rates.The increased energy costs also put pressure on warehousing and fulfillment costs due to the expenses on essentials like lighting, temperature control, intralogistics automation and similar facilities.Additionally, resource costs such as wood for pallets or paper for cartons and filling materials have already been increasing significantly in the last years with likely further increases in 2025.Last-mile delivery – Carrier and shipping costs 2025\\nBesides labor shortage and energy costs, overall inflation over the last few years has also been the key driver behind increasing carrier and shipping costs.All major carriers including DHL, UPS, and FedEx had significant price increases between 6.9% to 7.9% in the last years indicating the direction for overall market levels.| Looking at the overall dynamics of direct logistics costs, I’d recommend a CFO to put optimization of carrier and shipping costs on top of their agenda.E.g.in Germany given a domestic parcel rate of ca.€3 / international parcel rate of ca.€6, a 10% cost increase / optimization delivers €0.30ct to €0.60ct in

delivery – Carrier and shipping costs 2025\\nBesides labor shortage and energy costs, overall inflation over the last few years has also been the key driver behind increasing carrier and shipping costs.All major carriers including DHL, UPS, and FedEx had significant price increases between 6.9% to 7.9% in the last years indicating the direction for overall market levels.| Looking at the overall dynamics of direct logistics costs, I’d recommend a CFO to put optimization of carrier and shipping costs on top of their agenda.E.g.in Germany given a domestic parcel rate of ca.€3 / international parcel rate of ca.€6, a 10% cost increase / optimization delivers €0.30ct to €0.60ct in savings potential.This is very hard to squeeze out of €1 to €2 avg.total fulfillment costs / order with thin margins.|\\nLogistics costs insights from Boris Bösch, Co-CEO at everstox\\n6 pro-tips on how to reduce logistics costs in 2025\\nGiven the trade-off between direct logistics costs and total logistics costs, we’re focusing on 6 key tips that will help you to optimize your total logistics costs without sacrificing, potentially even improving, customer experience and logistics quality.Benchmark your current logistics costs and identify savings potentials\\nTip #1 to reduce logistics costs\\nLogistics is a thin-margin business.It’s impossible to negotiate cost savings when you’re already paying fair market rates for quality services without sacrificing heavily on indirect logistics costs.It’s key to benchmark your costs and to identify the right cost buckets where you’re potentially overpaying because of your overall supply chain set-up and design.Also, you should spend your time and efforts on cost optimization on the right things.everstox can support you on this exercise with a database of >1,000 quotes for warehousing & fulfillment services in different products & markets and negotiated carrier rates with all major carriers incl.DHL, UPS, FedEx, etc.\\nRequest your benchmark here\\n| everstox helped us reduce our direct logistics cost by 20-30% compared to standard market offerings.What’s more, we now expanded to 4 additional markets with 4 local warehouses and fulfillment solutions managed, monitored and coordinated with only 1 integrated platform.Thanks to everstox, we can easily track inventory flows, act quickly to avoid stock disruptions and at the same time reduce overhead for our operational team.In short: we are able to drastically reduce indirect costs to manage operations, even though we scaled our sales 5 times.|\\nLogistics costs insights from João Martins, CFO at Hey Harper\\nUse a specialized 3PL\\nTip #2 to reduce logistics costs\\nWork with a specialized 3PL that already understands your product and processes and serves within the warehouse already similar projects.By doing so, businesses can reduce fixed costs and overall fulfillment costs from 3PL’s expertise in every market scenario.According to McKinsey, specialized fulfillment drives cost savings of 7-9% in comparison to mainstream fulfillment.And it seems like they are more attractive to eCommerce businesses than ever.If you fit well into already established 3PL processes for other customers, you can benefit from their economies of scale and get access to attractive rates.3PLs usually can afford to invest more in warehouse automation across their customer base, particularly important in light of increasing warehouse labor costs.Learn more\\n| Given the current market environment, most eCommerce businesses will probably run below forecasts and thus 3PLs mostly (over)invested in capacities recently.The market timing in early 2025 will be good for eCommerce businesses to get access to attractive rates if they identify the perfectly fitting 3PL capacities.|\\nLogistics costs insights from Johannes Tress, Co-CEO at everstox\\nOptimize carrier costs and select dynamic shipping methods\\nTip #3 to reduce logistics costs\\nWorking with a partner like everstox that bundles a high amount of parcel volumes across their customer base can grant access to better rates through scale effects for the same carrier service levels.Also, everstox enables merchants of all sizes to follow a multi-carrier approach.There is no universal best-performing and most cost-efficient carrier, hence leading brands work with multiple partners for different product categories, target markets and service levels (e.g.Zalando has 38 parcel carriers across all markets).Within this multi-carrier set up a tech-driven dynamic carrier selection can be applied to optimize costs by product categories and target markets.E.g.everstox software enables you to intelligently choose the most cost-efficient solution between leading carriers like DHL, GLS, UPS, or FedEx for every order depending on parcel weight, dimension and destination.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"c5ghd1DUTFc0n1RAz2uAcQ8PKTccEmCuRCWzNV0yzk0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2a054b45-38f5-4e15-9d8d-d79f728baa6c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2a054b45-38f5-4e15-9d8d-d79f728baa6c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://everstox.com/logistics-insights/reduce-logistics-costs-in-2025/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"4eb0db91-de94-43f4-8c18-1aca1b156fe0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://everstox.com/logistics-insights/reduce-logistics-costs-in-2025/\"},\"hash\":\"Vw+0UK1noUc+P7eIPXoj89X1mKq97EM+wRkg3Bjc2+w=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"e4d48599-3664-4579-9e66-193102c5a823\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://everstox.com/logistics-insights/reduce-logistics-costs-in-2025/\"},\"hash\":\"Uf+rv/6+BetjPyAkqYZeTP8joTucrdh8Ntou7+NXsA8=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e38b1a6c-18e2-4125-a740-366baca74986\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Tga+clR3YtyXKOTLyLWV8/VV4VdLAoJWAvKiYOkm1Cg=\"}},\"text\":\"Also,

UPS, or FedEx for every order depending on parcel weight, dimension and destination.Learn more\\nOptimize your fulfillment center footprint and use multi-warehousing\\nTip #4 to reduce logistics costs\\nMany eCommerce businesses are significantly overpaying for logistics because of structural reasons in their logistics footprint.Often the main reason for the location of their main fulfillment center is that it’s close to their HQ vs. optimization for logistics costs.Oftentimes, there’s significant savings potential in choosing a location that is optimizing the equation between distance to production and main order destinations.Plus, e.g.in light of minimum wage increases close-to-border locations in Eastern Europe are often a chance to reduce logistics costs.Depending on the order structure, decentralizing fulfillment to multiple local warehouses often generates huge cost savings in carrier and shipping costs.Learn more\\nReduce manual work in day-to-day operations\\nTip #5 to reduce logistics costs\\nRising direct logistics costs can (partly) be offset with driving automation and reducing unnecessary manual work and labor across day-to-day operations.This requires optimizing efficiency in day-to-day interaction between your customer service, operations team and your warehousing, fulfillment and shipping operations.Learn more\\n| Thanks to the everstox technology, automation and digital workflows, we’ve been able to expand to multiple warehouse locations across Europe, the UK and the US and to multiple carrier service offerings including DHL, Warenpost, DHL Express, UPS or FedEx while keeping our workload in operations and customer service teams at efficient levels.|\\nLogistics costs insights from João Martins, CFO at Hey Harper\\nRun detailed cost audits\\nTip #6 to reduce logistics costs\\nStay in control of all your costs and pay for what you really get.Particularly carrier invoices can often be very intransparent with thousands of orders every month with different dimensions, weight categories, destinations, and various surcharges.It is very common that eCommerce businesses are overbilled by service providers without notice.However, it’s also impossible to review every invoice and every parcel sent line by line.It’s key to develop automated cost audit processes to stay on top of your expenses and within your budget.For example, everstox provides parcel audit services for all everstox shipping offerings to ensure customers that they only pay for what they get.Learn more\\n| everstox identifies significant cost claims on almost every carrier invoice.It’s a huge cost and time saving for us that we don’t have to do those cost audits ourselves.|\\nLogistics costs insights from João Martins, CFO at Hey Harper\\nKey takeaways – Optimizing logistics costs in 2025\\nTo be clear, 2025 will be a challenging year for eCommerce business CFOs and COOs.Keeping total logistics costs under control, while direct logistics costs around warehousing, fulfillment and shipping will likely increase at double-digit rates, and still delivering on customer experience is a huge mountain to climb.Thus, it’s key

enterprises.Read the press release on how Gründl skyrockets D2C commerce.July 5, 2021\\nTeam everstox\\nPress Release\\nThe Munich-based logistics specialists are taking over product fulfillment\\nfor the new D2C business division of the family-run medium-sized enterprise.Munich, July 5, 2021 – everstox, developer and operator of the Logistics-as-a-Service platform of the same name, is pleased to announce a new customer from the textile industry.The family-owned SME Gründl is handling the shipping and warehouse logistics of its newly established Direct-to-Consumer business entirely via the everstox platform and its Europe-wide network of qualified logistics partners.The well-established family business Gründl – headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria – is a leading European supplier of hand knitting yarns, wool and haberdashery.Since its foundation in the 1920s, the medium-sized company has continued to develop successfully and is now established as a modern top specialist in the textile industry.For its recently launched D2C distribution channel, Gründl was looking for a reliable partner to handle warehousing and fulfillment operations.“Our in-house team has very good, established logistics processes for the B2B sector.However, the challenges of e-commerce fulfillment, which is new to us, are fundamentally different – and quickly take you to your own limits,” recalls Sebastian Müller, Marketing and Sales Manager at Gründl.This is because the end customer business is characterized by individual parcel shipments with many, individual subtleties that are centrally important for a great unpacking experience.State-of-the-art technology enables an interconnected logistics network\\n“everstox was able to master these challenges without any problems and enabled us to perfectly set up the distribution logistics of our new D2C division within two weeks,” Müller is pleased to say.“We were immediately convinced because, unlike many other providers we know from previous projects, the Logistics-as-a-Service solution from everstox is structured in a completely transparent way.And the operational implementation also worked smoothly right from the start.”Today, Gründl benefits above all from easy access to highly qualified, specialized logistics partners from the Europe-wide everstox network.Within the interconnected network, Gründl can easily find the right partners who are precisely tailored to the needs of the medium-sized family business in terms of product storage, order fulfillment and shipping.Another plus point is the everstox Cloud Software: With the powerful software, all distribution logistics operations can be automated, monitored and managed.As a result, the family business not only has all order, fulfillment and warehouse data in real-time available in a clear dashboard, but also can add and edit new stock-keeping-units.But there’s many more features available for Gründl, for example: Tracking and tracing of orders and service level agreements, refilling stock or setting up automatic alerts to prevent delivery bottlenecks at the push of a button.What’s more, Gründl’s planned expansion of the D2C business into other European countries can also be mapped using the Logistics-as-a-Service platform: Thanks to the everstox solution, Gründl can seamlessly integrate new warehouse locations in order to reduce shipping costs and speed up order delivery with local fulfillment across Europe – without any additional integration effort.Find more information about Gründl.About everstox\\neverstox is a Munich-based
