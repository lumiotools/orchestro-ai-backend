That includes a properly sized “carton” (cardboard box, or container) for a product, as well as how many and which products should go into it. When combined with a Packsize automated packaging machine (like the X5), cartonization means having a perfectly sized box for each order that is shipped.\nCartonization can help you save money on shipping costs by minimizing the cubic volume and weight of your packages, which are the main factors that determine your shipping rates. It can also help you reduce waste and your environmental impact by using less packaging materials and shipping less air. Additionally, cartonization can increase your productivity and customer satisfaction by speeding up the packing process and ensuring that your products are packed securely and arrive undamaged.\nHow Does PackNet Cube Work?\nPackNet Cube is an online cartonisation solution that uses advanced algorithms to analyse the dimensions and weight of each item in the order. It then pairs the smallest possible box with the order. The box could be one from your set inventory, or it could be a right sized box made to order from a Packsize machine.\nThe cartonization software business rules engine is configurable and can split orders into shipment that your business requires.\nOur software can be integrated with warehouse management systems (WMS) or order management systems (OMS) to manage your inventory and orders. It can also be used with any packaging technology that you have in your warehouse.\nWhat are the benefits of PackNet Cube?\nBy using our software, you can enjoy the following benefits:\nLower transportation costs: You can reduce your shipping by optimizing the number of cartons, packaging materials, and pallets used for a shipment.\nReduced corrugated usage: You can use up to 26% less cardboard by choosing the right size and type of carton for each product.\nLess air shipped: You can ship up to 40% less empty space inside your packages by packing them as tightly as possible without compromising product protection.\nEnhanced customer satisfaction: You can delight your customers by delivering their orders faster, safer, and with less waste.\nGreater sustainability: You can reduce your carbon footprint and environmental impact by shipping fewer trucks and planes and using fewer resources.\nWhy should you use PackNet Cube instead of other cartonisation solutions?\nTo put it simply, Packsize has been in the business of sustainable shipping for more than two decades. Eco-friendly packaging is our mission. Central to that mission is removing as much waste from the packaging process as possible.\nPackNet Cube is the brain of our operation and we’re happy to open it up to the world (whether you use our packaging technology or not).\nHow can I purchase PackNet Cube?\nInterested in learning more?

an evaluation\nNorthern Tool + Equipment: Automation Built Better\nTrue partnership leading to an adaptable and growing automated packaging solution, reducing shipping costs, lowering carbon footprint, and improving overall packaging efficiency.✔\nReduced touchpoints with automation\n✔\nSignificantly reduced DIM weight and shipping costs\n✔\nStreamlined packaging process with right-sized boxes for every order\nThe Challenge: Too Many Touchpoints, Not Enough Throughput\nAs a home grown, family-owned and operated business, Northern Tool + Equipment came from humble beginnings.Over the last 40+ years, they’ve prided themselves on putting their customers first and being the ultimate destination for hard-working do-it-yourselfers and professionals.Inevitably, with success and growth comes change, and Northern Tool eventually found themselves in need of a packaging solution that could meet their growing demand, while saving them money and reducing touch points across their warehouse.They also needed a solution that could integrate into their brand new Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS), and wanted to reduce their carbon footprint.Having already worked with Packsize successfully in the past, Northern Tool knew they were the right fit for this next phase of their growth.Right-sized box on a conveyor at Northern Tool\n‍\n“About three years ago, we chose the Packsize EM7 machine to make right-size boxes for our larger products in order to reduce DIM weight charges,” said Randy Woody, Director of Distribution Engineering at Northern Tool.“That was a very successful project for us…we look for partners, we don't look for vendors.Packsize has proven to be a very good partner for us.So that led us directly into wanting to continue that partnership as we continued into this new adventure for us.”From the beginning, when we first met the Packsize team, we were very impressed with the overall mission and purpose of the team.We saw how those core values really materialize themselves from the top, all the way through the organization.As we started to look through the solutions [Packsize] offers, they were a perfect fit for what we were looking for, and then as we've continued the journey of starting, not just this project, but multiple projects, it's been a great experience working with the team end-to-end.Shaun Bunch, Chief Supply Chain and Retail Officer at Northern Tool\nThe Solution: Northern Tool Boxes, Made to Fit, On Demand\nFaster packaging automation - The X5 machine system at Northern Tool\nNorthern Tool’s main asks when reaching out to Packsize were to reduce touches throughout the packaging process, cut down on waste to improve customer experience, and reduce DIM weight and shipping costs.This quickly led them to choose one of Packsize’s most automated solutions: The X5.The X5 machine system provides all of the necessary functions to cut, crease, glue, erect, and label right-sized boxes in seconds so they are ready-to-pack.“For this project, the X5 was kind of a natural fit because the X5 is just so flexible,” said Chris Gross, Regional Sales Manager at Packsize.“It can pair with goods-to-person, AMRs (Autonomous Mobile Robots), it can be box first, box last, etc…and with the automated picking system that Northern Tool was putting in, the X5 allowed them to induct right-sized cartons to their goods-to-person stations and it eliminated a lot of touches while increasing throughput.”From All Hands On Deck to One Touch Wonders\nBefore implementing Packsize and an ASRS, Northern Tool’s packaging process was very manual and time consuming.When an order came in, manual pickers would push heavy carts across their three-level picking module, grabbing the products for the order.Sometimes, an order could end up being picked into a tote on all three levels before it was complete.Next, the order would make its way to a packing station, where a packer would try to find the best box size to fit the order, then pack it into the box along with void fillers, such as packing paper or air pillows.Finally, the order would be taped up, labeled, and make its way to the shipping truck.“Before Packsize was brought on board, our old process was outdated and everything about that process was more or less too many touch points, a lot of manual touches, and a lot of manual labor,” said Patrick Rhyne, Regional IT Manager at Northern Tool.“And what we needed was faster automation, a quicker solution that would give us everything that we wanted for faster fulfillment and get to the customer quicker.”After installing Packsize, the packaging process looks much different.Now when an order comes in, it immediately flows down virtually to the distribution center and into the automated system.The Packsize X5 determines the exact right-sized box for the order and makes a box in less than six seconds.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yGCIk8WEeT37w7ycUiFA0HwH+YTiADlZ4+IW/kUr7lc="},"b6848a01-1adc-43be-8786-fbf150fdec10":{"id_":"b6848a01-1adc-43be-8786-fbf150fdec10","metadata":{"url":"https://www.packsize.com/case-study/northern-tool"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"789be6b7-d8bf-4c21-bb66-dc6ace22c631","metadata":{"url":"https://www.packsize.com/case-study/northern-tool"},"hash":"/cWV3SJ+1R38YXyrAYE41OHksh+wQN4Fs4gIRc5D0f0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5a23df2e-82ae-4897-905c-86213dc2934d","metadata":{"url":"https://www.packsize.com/case-study/northern-tool"},"hash":"yGCIk8WEeT37w7ycUiFA0HwH+YTiADlZ4+IW/kUr7lc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"25c25baf-c6d9-4c17-9b53-b4cdc8e08697","metadata":{},"hash":"s9qBFfuslC45ZGVKOT0yZVH64+JBw4oAYUi5R4SafKw="}},"text":"Finally,

the same exact time, a picking robot grabs the products for the order and both the products and the right-sized box travel across a conveyor system to a packing station.There, the employee packages the order, adds a packing slip, and sends it on its way.The automated system then closes the box, applies a label, and sends it out the door.All of this happens in minutes with just one human touch throughout the entire process.An employee packages the on demand order\n‍\n“What was really cool about this project that was able to help Northern Tool is the X5 allowed them to create the box upstream of their goods-to-person system,” said Gross.“It really allowed them to eliminate a lot of touches in the pack process downstream because the X5 is the only system that's able to create perfectly sized cartons that can be routed to pick ports from a goods-to-person system.”With the X5 solution in place, Northern Tool was successfully able to reduce touchpoints, cut down on waste, significantly reduce shipping costs, and improve their end customer experience.A Partnership Built From Scratch\nFrom the very beginning, it was important to both Northern Tool and Packsize that this was more than just a vendor providing a service.Packsize wants to be a true partner in the packaging process and, with more than 20 years of experience on the front lines of packaging automation, we consider ourselves experts in our field.We also know that our clients are experts in their own industries, and so working together to implement the right solution for the job is crucial.“The very unique thing about Packsize when it comes to packaging is, we don't just have one machine that we're coming in and saying, ‘Hey, how does this fit in this area?’” said Gross.“We're able to really analyze the process and take one of our many machines or many software platforms and say, ‘What fits what the customer needs?Is it a non-conveyable project?Is it a conveyable project?Do we need cartonization software?Do we need box first, box last?’So the solution is really a result of all the diagnostic processes that we go through to see what the customer is trying to accomplish.”As a partner, Packsize wants to see our clients succeed and grow – and we are prepared to grow with them.At the start, Northern Tool was looking for a solution to create custom boxes for their larger, bulkier products.The EM7 was the perfect fit for that project.However, as their business grew, along with their automation needs, we were ready to accommodate that growth with another solution – and we were able to integrate it into the workflow that made the most sense for their unique distribution center.“We chose Packsize because they were a trusted partner from our first project with the EM7,” said Rhyne.“With integrations and everything that we dealt with, with the support teams to put that in place, we knew that the X5 would be a great product and we could tell that it would provide efficiencies and reduce touch points and everything that we needed from a product to help with our fulfillment.”Packsize right-sized X5 boxes ready for packing at Northern Tool\n‍\nOne of the biggest benefits clients experience with Packsize is world-class 24/7 customer service and support.Northern Tool was no exception here.As part of the X5 installation, Packsize also employs a field service engineer to be on-site at Northern Tool every day, to ensure the machine stays operating smoothly.“I think for Northern Tool, one of the most important factors in the business decision in addition to the partnership that we already had with Packsize, was just the trust that we had, knowing that the solution that was presented to us was the right one, knowing that we had the backing of a company that was going to be there with us for the long-term, and knowing that if we face challenges down the road, we weren't going to be out on an island alone,” said Woody.“We were going to have the backing that we needed to get through any challenges that we had and be able to push forward and make it through.”","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wax63RlqXuPuM7JDWsrPVfC5WxR82hbUQNomwjQsViU="},"25c25baf-c6d9-4c17-9b53-b4cdc8e08697":{"id_":"25c25baf-c6d9-4c17-9b53-b4cdc8e08697","metadata":{"url":"https://www.packsize.com/case-study/northern-tool"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"789be6b7-d8bf-4c21-bb66-dc6ace22c631","metadata":{"url":"https://www.packsize.com/case-study/northern-tool"},"hash":"/cWV3SJ+1R38YXyrAYE41OHksh+wQN4Fs4gIRc5D0f0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b6848a01-1adc-43be-8786-fbf150fdec10","metadata":{"url":"https://www.packsize.com/case-study/northern-tool"},"hash":"WAgaiZcRTUvReEcr171lSWLIZQEJkQnhZLRihPcO0Pg="}},"text":"Northern

The dynamic system provides distribution and fulfillment customers a\nhigh degree of automation to meet the growing challenge of rapid packing and shipping. The highly reliable X4® assesses and creates the most efficient and complete right-sized box for each individual order to eliminate unnecessary void fill and reduce shipping costs, among other benefits.\n“Distribution businesses today seek greater automation in the machinery they install in their facilities,” said Packsize CEO Hanko Kiessner. “The X4® delivers on this expectation for high-volume packaging environments.”\nThe small footprint of the X4® adds to its flexibility, allowing for a box to be erected and inducted onto a conveyor line, placed on a cart, or packaged right next to the machine. Packaging managers can orchestrate and manage single-piece, batch, and demanding corrugated packaging workflows. The X4® can also be deployed in a multiple-machine environment alongside other Packsize systems, or placed in a two to four X4® machine configuration to produce up to 1,200 boxes an hour.\nIntegrating sustainability into the e-commerce supply chain, the X4® includes multiple infeeds to accept up to four widths of corrugated z-Fold®. The machine’s versatility with this reusable resource achieves a wider variety of box sizes needed to quickly pack every order.\nPacksize leveraged its market-leading expertise in lean manufacturing from European production principles to manufacture the X4® in the United States. Kiessner notes, “The X4® was designed with quality and reliability top of mind.”\n‍\nAbout Packsize\nPacksize transforms how businesses and their customers experience packaging – from packing to unboxing.

Some will accept that “on demand” means sooner rather than later.\nThose in the business sector needing instant results want “on demand” to have a more literal definition: They make a request and it’s immediately set in motion. Packsize, which offers custom box-making machinery via a portfolio of On Demand Packaging® solutions, meets these expectations as rapid product delivery demands continue to rise.\nShoppers are starting to expect rapid one-day delivery from all of their online orders because some companies are more than happy to offer it for free. According to an April 2019 article from RetailDive.com, Amazon’s rapid shipping has forced fellow powerhouses Target and Walmart to contemplate the same. The result of this brinkmanship about “delivery promises” has “reset” consumer expectations. “The back and forth is really around framing these services rather than fundamental changes in existing capabilities,” a consulting company told RetailDive.com. “What’s really, really important though is that both retailers in discussing this are really framing their capabilities around convenience—the number one issue for consumers.”\nPeople clearly want their orders faster and cheaper than ever. Businesses that need to reach this rather high bar can turn to a line of box-making machines from Packsize that make an On Demand Packaging® solution possible—the X-series. Not only do companies that invest in these machines make boxes that fit orders better, but the speed of the packaging line is increased as well.\nThe X4 system, as an example, is capable of cutting, folding, labeling, and gluing a corrugated box in just 12 seconds. What’s more, our custom packaging solutions are never “one-box-fits-all.” Rather, Packsize software programs will assess the dimensions of the item being shipped so a more form-fitting parcel is produced. This takes the guesswork out of finding a box that’s nearly the right size. This wastes time and money—a pariah to effective businesses.\nImproving upon these benchmarks, the X7 is another tool for companies who know that Right-sized Packaging On Demand® is an essential part of production. This machine can cut, pack, and label a shipping-ready box every three seconds. The X7 would particularly benefit high-volume distribution centers, as speed is as important a consideration as creating right-sized packages, which can reduce shipping costs.\nAs your customers’ demands for rapid deliveries rise, Packsize’s custom packaging solutions are ready to meet your needs.
