This huge and ambitious claim was made because of the transformative nature of the technology and the effect it will have on society. For logistics and transportation, it will have a bigger impact promising to shake up the $8T industry.\\nWhat is blockchain?\\nTo put it simply, a blockchain is like a database. It’s a way of storing records of value and transactions. However, calling blockchain a new type of database is like saying email is a new way of sending people letters. While the blockchain is a database, that definition doesn’t explain the true genius behind how the blockchain stores records of value and transactions. We continue our blockchain news coverage of the technology and its impact on the freight markets and society as a whole.\\nFreightWaves Staff Friday, November 16, 2018\\nOrange Business Services joins the Blockchain in Transport Alliance\\nBy joining BiTA, Orange Business Services confirms its co-innovation approach with customers and partners to help enable the wide adoption of blockchain applications in digital supply chain solutions by standardizing developed use cases.\\nRead More »\\nFreightWaves Staff Friday, November 16, 2018\\ndexFreight founders celebrate BiTA anniversary, call for more collaboration\\ndexFreight founders Hector Hernandez and Rajat Rajbhandari want the supply chain community to realize that blockchain is for them.\\nRead More »\\nFreightWaves Staff Thursday, November 15, 2018\\nHublock Becomes a Member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance\\nHublock, a software solution based on data-sharing layer has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards relating to blockchain in the transportation/logistics/supply chain marketplace.\\nRead More »\\nJohn Paul Hampstead Thursday, November 15, 2018\\nKey takeaways from the Blockchain in Transport Alliance fall symposium\\nOn Wednesday at the Texan Gaylord Resort and Convention Center, following MarketWaves18, members of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) met to receive updates on the organization’s progress toward data standards, hear announcements, share feedback, and learn about the work being done by BiTA’s think thanks.\\nRead More »\\nFreightWaves Staff Wednesday, November 14, 2018\\nFilament breaks out blockchain enterprise solution and Daimler partnership\\nBiTA member, Filament, demonstrated an important new product, and announced a major partnership this week.\\nRead More »\\nJohn Kingston Monday, November 12, 2018\\nMW Demo Day Round 3: blockchain, intermodal and still some paper out there\\nBlockchain solutions, improved interfaces, artificial intelligence and a tool for the intermodal business.\\nRead More »\\nFreightWaves Staff Thursday, November 8, 2018\\nGetting ready for Demo Day at MarketWaves, part 3: more companies and what they’ll be showing\\nThe list continues: what will be shown at Demo Day in Dallas this year?\\nRead More »\\nFreightWaves Staff Tuesday, November 6, 2018\\nOcean Alliance starts own blockchain group, firing shot across bow of Maersk-IBM alliance\\nNew group floats alternative blockchain solution for container trade.\\nRead More »\\nFreightWaves Staff Tuesday, November 6, 2018\\nGetting ready for Demo Day at MarketWaves18, part 2: what several more companies are going to show\\nA wide variety of solutions will be on display at DemoDay.\\nRead More »\\nFreightWaves Staff Tuesday, November 6, 2018\\nenVista Joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance\\nenVista, a leading global consulting and software solutions firm, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation/logistics/freight marketplace.\\nRead More »\\nFreightWaves Staff Monday, November 5, 2018\\nLiteLink Technologies Inc.

global GDP would be built on top of blockchain applications.This huge and ambitious claim was made because of the transformative nature of the technology and the effect it will have on society.For logistics and transportation, it will have a bigger impact promising to shake up the $8T industry.What is blockchain?To put it simply, a blockchain is like a database.It’s a way of storing records of value and transactions.However, calling blockchain a new type of database is like saying email is a new way of sending people letters.While the blockchain is a database, that definition doesn’t explain the true genius behind how the blockchain stores records of value and transactions.We continue our blockchain news coverage of the technology and its impact on the freight markets and society as a whole.FreightWaves Staff Friday, November 16, 2018\\nOrange Business Services joins the Blockchain in Transport Alliance\\nBy joining BiTA, Orange Business Services confirms its co-innovation
