When a multi-billion dollar beauty brand’s eCommerce platform reaches the end of its life, the entire business is at risk — including the ability to serve customers where, when and how they want to be served.\\nBy switching to Commercetools and embracing a more flexible MACH architecture, a retailer’s vision for connecting in-store and personalized shopping experiences can become a reality.The brand can experiment and roll out new features within days.  Not to mention secure a position as a modern brand that uses tech to its advantage, breaking sales records and expanding retail and commerce footprints.\\nIf you are being held hostage by your technology platforms and your developers have thrown up their hands, tell them to start a free trial at www.commercetools.com today.\\nIt’s May 15, 2023, and this is the Watson Weekly - your essential eCommerce Digest!\\nToday on our show:\\nBigCommerce Reports Earnings\\neBay Prepares Launch of International Shipping Program\\nFlexport is Missing the Infrastructure to Compete with Large Players\\nAmazon Gives Shoppers Incentives to Pick Up Their Orders\\n- and finally, The Investor Minute, which contains 7 items this week from the world of venture capital, acquisitions, and IPOs.\\n==\\nTo hear new episodes of the show every Monday morning, subscribe now at rmwcommerce.com/watsonweekly and wherever you get your podcasts.\\n==\\n[PAUSE]\\nBUT FIRST in our shopping cart full of news….\\nBigCommerce Reports Earnings\\nLast week BigCommerce reported its earnings and it looked to me like a steady improvement over the past year.\\nLook, in some ways, BigCommerce is a bit like the Maytag Repairman of eCommerce. Not exciting on the outside, but a dependable software-as-a-service business on the inside. In other ways, BigCommerce is like the Rodney Dangerfield of eCommerce — it “Gets No Respect”.  It is a solid platform that did not capture the eCommerce zeitgeist like Shopify.  \\nIn its history, BigCommerce has had two primary issues.  \\nOne, the company is not widely known.  It still is not even included in many RFPs except in certain segments. Of course, this is a problem and an opportunity the company seems to recognize. It’s encouraging to hear Brent talking about turning off SMB marketing and activating field marketing and events for Enterprise customers.\\nTwo, BigCommerce is under-monetized. In the land of exciting business models and attach rates of the competition, BigCommerce is primarily a simple SaaS Enterprise play. So 2000s right?\\nIn the end, the best play for BigCommerce is probably a new acquirer, which I will not speculate on here. Still, private equity is the easiest bet to make, given the large number of growing, slightly unprofitable, high gross margin, SaaS Enterprise players who have been acquired in the last two years: Avalara and Zendesk to name only two, and there are more.\\nIt’s not required, mind you, but it would accelerate their trajectory.\\nFrom a results point of view, there is a lot to like in BigCommerce’s earnings. \\nFor 2023 Q1 earnings, \\n* The company remains focused on raising its Average Revenue Per Account, up 11% year over year to $39K. This is a healthy raise from its previous $30K-$33K in the past, and indicates that management seems to understand the levers it has to improve this. \\n* Total revenue was $71.8 million, up 9% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Pretty steady.\\n* Increasing gross margins were reported. GAAP gross margin was 76%, compared to 74% in the first quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin was 77%, compared to 75% in the first quarter of 2022.\\n* Feedonomics is also a good play for BigCommerce. It’s needed functionality if you are going to be merchant-centric, and it’s not easy to find reliable Enterprise partners (outside of ChannelAdvisor).  There is one area BigCommerce outshines Shopify here: a connection to Amazon. How many Enterprise brands are on Amazon? “Many” is the answer, and a significant number are first-party merchants still. After all, if you are in big-box retail, Amazon wants you in first-party more often than not.  \\nHaving spent a career at ChannelAdvisor, it’s not an easy business to connect to marketplaces. But this functionality is essential with the near-constant updates to marketplaces. Shopify will need this same kind of connection to Amazon if it continues to move up-market.\\nAs part of a larger entity with more resources, the company could accelerate. It has a narrow focus which seems to be narrowing even further. With some marketing help and additional resources and talent, the company could be even better.\\n[References:]\\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/ecommercestrategyconsulting_bigcommerce-saas-activity-7060246408817209344-QheM\\nhttps://investors.bigcommerce.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bigcommerce-announces-first-quarter-2023-financial-results\\nOur Second Story\\neBay Prepares Launch of International Shipping Program\\nIt looks like eBay is finally taking the wraps off its International Shipping (EIS) program in July of this year, with eBay migrating sellers to the program over the next few months.\\nOn a personal note, over 4 years ago now, I spent about 3 years at Pitney Bowes working with its cross-border software. What used to be called eBay Global Shipping Program, or GSP, used to be almost exclusively provided by Pitney Bowes. This has changed going forward to a set of partners.\\nThe big challenge with cross-border on a global marketplace like eBay is data. And by that I mean, the data provided by sellers is completely terrible. Which means all providers must work extra hard to estimate, guess, and learn, and all other manner of techniques – including manual work – to help make global eCommerce possible in such a scenario.\\neBay International Shipping is for the small sellers of the world – the job is to make it easy. Ebay sellers don't do much more than enable it on their listings, and ship normally. eBay takes care of the rest, including compliance, payments, duties and taxes, and delivery – all through an integrated network of partners.\\nCross-border shipping to 200+ countries for eBay sellers is the goal; existing sellers will be transitioned over the next few months with a hard cut-over on July 1.\\nAs far as providers for the program:\\n* Avalara is providing compliance, classification, and landed cost pricing – it's not exactly a surprise as Avalara has quite a number of ex-Borderfree and Pitney Bowes employees there for the past several years. So a big chunk of that heavy lifting Pitney Bowes used to do is now taken on by Avalara.\\nIt's hard to find a company with the global scope in these kinds of complex situations like Avalara. Alternatives are generally cobbling together multiple providers.\\n* It also looks to me like eBay is supporting not just cross-dock freight forwarding through the US, but also direct international cross-border shipments from the seller's location with providers like EasyShip, which also announced support for the initiative.\\n* It appears to me that (based on its press release), Pitney Bowes retained its contract as provider of eBay's Global Shipping Program in the United Kingdom. \\n* I read that eBay is partnering up with a solution called ShipRocket in India.\\nHere's to the next 10 years of eBay International Shipping supporting small and medium sellers across the globe. It really is one of the better programs in the industry supporting cross-border sellers.\\n[References:]\\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/ecommercestrategyconsulting_crossborder-ebay-activity-7061672787861495808-SfFT/\\nhttps://community.ebay.com/t5/Announcements/eBay-International-Shipping-is-here/ba-p/33700544\\nOur Third Story\\nFlexport is Missing the Infrastructure to Compete with Large Players\\nWell, the dust has settled on the sale of Deliverr to Flexport, and I’m not so certain that this sale looks so great in the light of day for the acquirer.\\nYes, this extends Flexport's addressable market, but is it healthy? How is this anything but shuffling a few deck chairs around? A few days after the deal is done, a few questions remain.\\nFirst, where is the infrastructure?\\nThe simple reality is that Deliverr does not operate its own facilities and does not control its own volume, so where will the volume come from? The biggest logistics players are investing in fixed assets.\\nDave Clark's assertion that shipping will happen for your eCommerce site, and your stores – I can't think of any math here that makes this equation work. Do you think eCommerce is a tough market to crack? Try store distribution. It's a 50+ year entrenched business with even slimmer margins.\\nWhat is the size of the margin prize here? Forget the technology – if you pitched a VC on disrupting how people ship to a store, you would get laughed out of the room (if you could even get through the door).\\nThe only people who have innovated in shipping to stores in the past 10 years is Target, and it's because Target controls all sides of the network: the distribution center, the store, and the downstream sort facility.\\nLong term, the only way this works is if Flexport can aggregate enough volume to afford to vertically integrate logistics, rather than push work to partners. Otherwise you are simply just another middleman: what are you operating?\\nAt some point, I expect an asset merger to pair with Flexport's technology. Perhaps private equity could make the tie-up. More must be coming.\\nThere is really only one path forward: Flexport needs to find a source of virtually guaranteed volume like signing all the global marketplaces as customers. The only challenge is many of them are logistics companies themselves. Again, more must be coming.\\nSecond, I’m left wondering what the terms of the deal between Shopify and Flexport are.\\nI am expecting that other third-party logistics providers can still connect to Shopify, so this doesn't limit existing players.\\nRe-reading Tobi's note about the sale of Deliverr to Flexport, he referred to Flexport as the preferred provider of logistics for Shopify. Preferred does not mean exclusive.\\nWouldn't it be in Shopify's best interest to shop this capability around to the best fulfillment provider for consumers, rather than simply the company that took Deliverr off its hands?\\nMaybe Shopify still has this flexibility. It's also possible that Shopify now views Flexport in a similar way for logistics that it views Stripe for payments.\\nWhere does that leave the future merchant experience for brands that don't use the preferred provider? There is more to be revealed here, also.  \\n[References:]\\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/ecommercestrategyconsulting_flexport-shopify-activity-7061311207101603841-zIX1/\\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/shopify-tried-failed-to-challenge-amazon-in-logistics-2023-5\\n[PAUSE]\\nAnd Our Last Story\\nAmazon Gives Shoppers Incentives to Pick Up Their Orders\\nApparently Amazon is testing a new service in the wild which was discovered by some customers. IIf you are willing to pick up your order from an Amazon pick-up location like Whole Foods or Kohl’s, then Amazon will give you a $10 incentive.  An Amazon spokesperson said it's been testing for some time.\\nThis follows other Amazon incentives for changing your delivery activity. One of the most popular Amazon Prime incentives is a digital services credit for shipping items to you on a Friday. \\nAnother (dis)incentive that Amazon recently announced was that it will start charging the customer $1 when shipping a return back through a UPS store instead of a Whole Foods, if the Whole Foods is closer to the customer’s house.\\nThis program is a little different, however.  This new incentive feels like a way to reduce shipping costs, except when you realize that losing $10 per order gets pretty expensive pretty fast. That is almost certainly higher than what it costs Amazon to ship an order end-to-end, so why such a high incentive?\\nHere are two ideas for you. First, what if this is about reducing the company’s risk to Delivery Service Providers?  What does this encourage? Larger B2B moves which could be handled by fuller truckloads, and avoiding the use of DSPs or Delivery Service Providers.\\nWhat is the biggest flashpoint in supply chain these days? It’s labor. Costs are rising, and there is increasing risk that workers will unionize which will increase Amazon’s costs and reduce Amazon’s bargaining power, or Federal regulators will change their stance on Delivery Service Partners.\\nTo me that $10 could be seen as a risk reduction payment to reduce the company’s exposure to its Delivery Service Partner network if ever happens.  It’s also not lost on me that most carriers are consolidating routes this year.  If enough volume moves that it can cut back on routes, it could help win in other areas.\\nSecond, another thought would be that Amazon is testing the consumer response to its owned network, and how many customers would be willing to get out of their house to pick an order rather than have it delivered?  From there, it can run all sorts of sensitivity analysis to learn if there is some correlation between distance from the customer’s home to the pickup facility, item value or type, or some other correlation that might help them determine how to optimize their network further — including when to open a new facility.\\nWhile this isn’t a widespread program now, I might consider picking up $10 if it were offered to me in the future, or at least it might make me think twice if there was an Amazon pickup point nearby.\\nIt could also be a solution for porch pirates in certain areas in the United States.\\n[References:]\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-offers-shoppers-10-pick-up-purchases-it-targets-delivery-costs-2023-05-08/\\n\\n[PAUSE]\\nWe’ll be right back after a word from our sponsor.\\n<CT>\\nHey, Watsonians, this is Rick. Want to get my take on a burning question and have me answer on this podcast? You can start a topic on the RMW Commerce Community and just ask!\\nThe Community is full of eCommerce diehards just like you talking about important eCommerce issues. Just last week one of the popular topics added by Miles Thomas was using AI to generate product content.  Only thing is, better verify it’s accurate.\\nYou can contribute to the conversation at community.rmwcommerce.com.\\nIt’s that time, Friends, for our Investor Minute.  We have 7 items on the menu today.\\nFirst\\nConstruction solutions provider EquipmentShare completed a $290 million funding round.\\nConstructionShare provides contractors visibility into all their operations on the job site. This includes things like bottlenecks in their fleets, machines that have gone offline, and job and equipment utilization reports. Although I am skeptical that there will be so many winners in this kind of visibility market, it is likely that there could be one winner for the industry given that customers tend to follow each other's solutions.\\nLink: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equipmentshare-completes-290-million-funding-round-led-by-bdt-capital-partners-301801427.html\\nSecond\\nHome fitness solution Tonal received  new funding and a CEO.\\nIt’s really unclear to me how these connected fitness companies keep getting funding. Here are the details: A new $130 million raise from L Catterton. This is on top of a $250 million Series E the company raised in 2021, and the company now says it is REALLY CLOSE to profitability. Which I’m sure is exactly why they raised over $100 million, because they are so close to cash-flow breakeven.\\nLink: https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/after-a-turbulent-few-years-for-home-fitness-tonal-gets-fresh-funding-and-new-ceo/\\nThird\\nComposable checkout platform Rally raised $12 million.\\nThe company looks like it ripped off Shopify’s Shop Pay flow; it then even has a payment solution called Rallypay. But it is bringing this checkout to other platforms. At this point, it will go head-on with solutions like Bolt and Bold. It’s a tough market to crack as many people think that the eCommerce platform itself should provide a checkout solution.\\ncheckout/\\nFourth\\nAI-based computer vision company Groundlight raised a seed round.\\nThe company is solving an interesting problem – how to meld AI chatbot interfaces and the large amount of video and imagery that are inside of corporations. The goal would be for operators to be able to query what is happening in video streams using text, and receive answers to those queries with verification. Kind of a clever idea.\\nLink: https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-and-microsoft-vets-raise-10m-for-computer-vision-startup-used-in-warehouses/\\nFifth\\nSupply chain firm Descartes Group acquired Australian last-mile scheduling platform Localz.\\nLocalz looks like a startup that was acquired for $6.2 million from Descartes, which is a large player in SaaS supply chain technology solutions for B2B applications. It seems to me this fills a gap in its offerings, which allows its customers to reschedule and be notified in real-time about a shipment’s progress.\\nLink: https://www.freightwaves.com/news/descartes-acquires-australian-firm-localz\\nSixth\\nLicensing firm Authentic Brands Group acquired intellectual property of fashion brand Vince.\\nAuthentic Brands Group is one of the largest brand licensing firms in the world and it’s owned by Jamie Salter. Vince sold this for $76 million dollars to ABG, but still holds a 25% interest in the new entity.  While Vince will pay an ongoing royalty fee to the new IP owner, it will also receive 25% of the cash generated by the business. If you’ve ever watched Shark Tank, this is one of those deals that Mr. Wonderful would love.\\nLink: https://www.retaildive.com/news/vince-sells-IP-to-authentic/648442/\\nAND FINALLY …\\nComposable commerce platform Elastic Path acquired no-code frontend Unstack.\\nIn the composable market in the past year, there has been somewhat of a shift. Both Commercetools and Elastic Path have acquired front-end software. It appears even composable platforms like certain things all-in-one, although both platforms still allow the flexibility for buyers to choose any front-end software stack they want.\\nLink: https://www.elasticpath.com/resources/press-releases/elastic-path-acquires-unstack-empower-merchandisers-blazing-fast-no-code\\n[PAUSE]\\nThat’s all for this week!

And eCommerce to film is a classic example, right? If you think about a warehouse. You know, all day long is picking and packing and picking and packing. Uh, but the part that makes that task hard to automate is that you could be picking and packing 10 million or 20 million different objects, right?

Simon: “Running a warehouse today is very hard because of the labor problem, right? The, it's, it's very hard to find, to recruit, to train and to retain hundreds or thousands of people.

You know, by the number of nodes in, in your network by three nodes, four nodes, five nodes, you know, whatever it might be. And so that, you know, you're quickly managing thousands of people. It takes a lot of money and, and effort and overhead to manage all of that.

Making sure that customers' expectations are met every time they come to your store is much harder than it sounds. Mark talks about the overall value of visibility not only for customer experience but for more efficient processes on the business side.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT MARK</strong></p><p>Mark Delaney is currently VP Industry Strategy at FourKites. In this role, he engages with retailers’ C-level leaders and their teams to understand and address industry-specific workflows and use cases. He serves as an SME to help drive the product roadmap and support our global sales teams. He keeps a strong pulse on industry trends and frequently solicits customer and partner’s feedback on the technology investments that they are making to help inform and advance FourKite’s innovation with a customer-first mindset. He represents FourKites at industry events and briefings. Prior to FourKites, Mark was a Retail Industry Principal at Zebra Technologies where he led customer briefings, met with the press and analysts and worked with their Ventures organization evaluating potential investments.</p><p><br /> </p><p>Mark has more than 20 years of experience in the retail industry and has worked with most large retailers globally. Before joining Zebra, Mark held leadership roles at Nielsen and General Mills and owned his own retail technology and analytics consulting firm.</p><p> </p><p>Mark holds a BS in Marketing from SUNY Oswego and serves on several boards in his community.

Now because that loyalty's been shattered, there's a very good chance they're going to go across the street to your competitor.\\\"<br /> </p><p>21:56 The importance of listening to consumers and customers - Mark: \\\"One other area that's top of mind with our customers these days is employee satisfaction. Because it's very expensive to lose a good employee, especially someone who's been there for a period of time and you've invested in all that training. For them to be mired down by spreadsheets and phone calls and all that, if you can give them that visibility and confidence that they're communicating something that's accurate, they feel better as associates.\\\"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Find out more about Mark in the links below:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjdelaney001/\\\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjdelaney001/</a></li><li>Website: <a href=\\\"https://www.fourkites.com/\\\">https://www.fourkites.com/</a></li></ul> <p><p><strong>Subscribe and Keep Learning!</strong></p><p>If you’re a logistics leader looking to scale sustainably, don’t miss out!

Now because that loyalty's been shattered, there's a very good chance they're going to go across the street to your competitor.\\\" 21:56 The importance of listening to consumers and customers - Mark: \\\"One other area that's top of mind with our customers these days is employee satisfaction. Because it's very expensive to lose a good employee, especially someone who's been there for a period of time and you've invested in all that training. For them to be mired down by spreadsheets and phone calls and all that, if you can give them that visibility and confidence that they're communicating something that's accurate, they feel better as associates.\\\" Find out more about Mark in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjdelaney001/ Website: https://www.fourkites.com/</itunes:summary>\\n<itunes:subtitle>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Mark Delaney, Vice President of Global Industry Strategy at FourKites.

HIGHLIGHTS 02:31 How Sandra led as the first-ever Chief Supply Chain Officer of Kimberly-Clark 09:33 Must-have attributes when building a team for supply chain 13:29 The top priorities leading Mondelēz at the start of the pandemic 23:26 On moving to digital 27:54 Comparing regional innovation and sustainability 36:51 What we can expect with automation in the CPG QUOTES 04:28 Sandra's advice for future supply chain leadership: \\\"Don't lose sight of what supply chain is, is what I would say at the start. There are key principles that we have in supply chain around who we are and what we are. They apply anywhere. So if anybody tells you, you have to rethink everything, that's not true. There's core, basic fundamentals, service quality, safety, and all these kinds of things. 29:13 We should connect together where we can - Sandra: \\\"If they've not had recognition, they feel the need to be seen, so it has to be theirs. And as opposed to when we get to, hopefully at some point when business and the corporate world gets to the place where we're gonna share with each other for the better of everything. It sounds a bit naive, but I do believe that's what we should be doing corporately.\\\" Find out more about Sandra in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandramacquillan/</itunes:subtitle>\\n<itunes:keywords>dan coll, ecom logistics podcast, e-commerce retail, procurement, logistics, supply chain, fulfillment iq, ninaad acharya, sustainability, sandra macquillan</itunes:keywords>\\n<itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit>\\n<itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>\\n<itunes:episode>23</itunes:episode>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<guid isPermaLink=\\\"false\\\">8f940526-b08f-4691-a829-b951adce35e9</guid>\\n<title>How To Transition to Sustainable Fleet Operations Using Data and Logistics with Essa Al-Saleh</title>\\n<description>\\n<![CDATA[ <p>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Essa Al-Saleh, CEO and Board Member of Volta Trucks.

Being the true last mile partner where orders are delivered the same day they pick it up has been the goal of Alok's company. They wanted to be hyperlocal and empower local SMBs to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world. </p><p>Alok digs into why different last-mile solutions exist to address the needs of different types of buyers. He also explains that, given their low barrier for entry, that local shops can be given a low risk alternative to see how they can offer a comparable solution to Amazon and grow their business.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT ALOK</strong></p><p>Alok has over 15 years in software, technology and e-commerce. Along with his co-founders, Alok has created a platform, in Trexity, that makes it possible for any small business to deliver quickly and locally. Alok is a serial entrepreneur who encourages and supports like-minded individuals to succeed in their business.</p><p>Alok began imagining a platform that could make it possible for any small business to deliver local and fast, and one that is fair and takes advantage of neither merchants nor couriers. He believes that filling this need will help disrupt our over-reliance on faraway e-commerce giants and help small businesses stay in business. </p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>01:20 Alok's early exposure to business and his passion for technology</li><li>06:01 Perfecting last-mile, hyperlocal delivery for SMBs</li><li>12:38 The future of last-mile delivery: Owned Infrastructure vs. the Gig Economy  </li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p>07:50 Perfecting hyperlocal delivery opened up national markets for Trexity - Alok: \\\"We started out empowering your favorite store on your favorite street of your favorite neighborhood. The local mom and pop. And on of the things that was really important to us when we started out, we said, let's be the true last mile partner. The same day we pick it up, it's the same day we're going to drop it off, as fast as our merchants are willing to fulfill it, it's as fast as we will deliver it. And let this be the one thing that we do so perfectly well that no one else can touch us on it.\\\" </p><p>13:25 Owned-infrastructure and gig economy have their own pros and cons - Alok: \\\"It's not one or the other. Both of those FedEx models exist for a reason because there's an addressable market for both of them. And I don't think it has to be warehousing or direct from merchant. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

Being the true last mile partner where orders are delivered the same day they pick it up has been the goal of Alok's company. They wanted to be hyperlocal and empower local SMBs to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world. Alok digs into why different last-mile solutions exist to address the needs of different types of buyers. He also explains that, given their low barrier for entry, that local shops can be given a low risk alternative to see how they can offer a comparable solution to Amazon and grow their business. ABOUT ALOK Alok has over 15 years in software, technology and e-commerce. Along with his co-founders, Alok has created a platform, in Trexity, that makes it possible for any small business to deliver quickly and locally. Alok is a serial entrepreneur who encourages and supports like-minded individuals to succeed in their business. Alok began imagining a platform that could make it possible for any small business to deliver local and fast, and one that is fair and takes advantage of neither merchants nor couriers. He believes that filling this need will help disrupt our over-reliance on faraway e-commerce giants and help small businesses stay in business. HIGHLIGHTS 01:20 Alok's early exposure to business and his passion for technology 06:01 Perfecting last-mile, hyperlocal delivery for SMBs 12:38 The future of last-mile delivery: Owned Infrastructure vs. the Gig Economy QUOTES 07:50 Perfecting hyperlocal delivery opened up national markets for Trexity - Alok: \\\"We started out empowering your favorite store on your favorite street of your favorite neighborhood. The local mom and pop. And on of the things that was really important to us when we started out, we said, let's be the true last mile partner. The same day we pick it up, it's the same day we're going to drop it off, as fast as our merchants are willing to fulfill it, it's as fast as we will deliver it. And let this be the one thing that we do so perfectly well that no one else can touch us on it.\\\" 13:25 Owned-infrastructure and gig economy have their own pros and cons - Alok: \\\"It's not one or the other. Both of those FedEx models exist for a reason because there's an addressable market for both of them. And I don't think it has to be warehousing or direct from merchant. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

He has lived and worked in China, India, Africa, Saudi Arabia, Europe, and the United States. Brittain is a global strategy and supply chain consultant and a writer for Forbes and his own website, brittainladd.com.

I think what TikTok needs to do is, again, change how commerce is done on the platform. So I think what would be very interesting is if TikTok acquires Shopify, so where now I have Shopify, I have a Shopify storefront on TikTok, and so then what happens is I immediately see a video come across but it's a video from a storefront, and without having to go to a website, I see it, I buy it.

Edward shares the trends in supply chain he is observing today post-COVID and beyond. </p><p>From the way Amazon changed logistics forever and its effects in consumer expectations as a result, to the importance of remaining agile and how to do it, Edward takes a deep dive into how global supply chains will look like in the near future and how to maintain inventory to scale.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT EDWARD</strong></p><p>Edward Hertzman received a degree in economics from NYU and spent more than a decade working as a top executive for major sourcing companies all over the world, including Synergies Worldwide and Pearl Global. Hertzman sits on the Board for Delivering Good, a charitable organization that channels the resources of the fashion industry to those in need.</p><p>In 2009, in response to a need in the industry, he founded Sourcing Journal Online. With more than 75,000 subscribers, Sourcing Journal Online is the largest trade journal devoted to the sourcing apparel and textile industry supply chain in the world. </p><p>In August 2020, he was promoted to executive vice president of Fairchild Media, tasked with growing the businesses of all Fairchild Media titles in his new position, while continuing to lead the day-to-day operations at Sourcing Journal. He will also oversee the growth of Fairchild Media’s strategic content studio, bolstering the creation of engaging, interactive content to help industry partners stand out in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>07:07 DTC is dying and mergers are set to happen</li><li>13:08 Surviving devaluation and managing inventory for what's to come</li><li>20:23 Keeping sourcing lean and agile in fashion</li><li>25:23 Nearshoring and diversifying manufacturing and sourcing capabilities</li><li>30:22 Regulations and sharing the responsibility of sustainability in supply chain management</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p><strong>14:27 On pushing back on the growth-at-all-costs mindset, Edward says, </strong>\\\"Just don't acquire customers saying, <i>Oh, the lifetime value is X </i>and never really realize that. Don't buy inventory without testing the product. Find retail partners that are gonna support you, not just be transactional.\\\"</p><p><strong>31:09 As regulations will push for tangible sustainability measures from retail, Edward says, </strong>\\\"I think there's only two ways to incentivize people or two ways to get people to change. One is through incentive and one is through repercussions. And what I mean by that is either you're gonna pay me more to do something or you're gonna punish me for not doing it.\\\"</p><p><strong>39:48 To survive the recession, Edward suggests, </strong>\\\"I think that if people don't think short term, the same way I say don't buy a million T-shirts when you really only need five. Don't just start laying off to make the quarter. It's very hard to find talent in this space. Don't stop investing in technology to make the quarter because you're gonna need that technology.\\\"</p><p> </p><p>Find out more about <strong>Edward </strong>and <strong>Sourcing Journal </strong>in the links below:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-hertzman-2401b38/\\\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-hertzman-2401b38/</a></li><li>Twitter: <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/EdwardHertzman\\\">https://twitter.com/EdwardHertzman</a></li><li>Instagram: <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/edwardhertzman/\\\">https://www.instagram.com/edwardhertzman/</a></li><li>Website: <a href=\\\"https://sourcingjournal.com/\\\">https://sourcingjournal.com/</a></li></ul> <p><p><strong>Subscribe and Keep Learning!</strong></p><p>If you’re a logistics leader looking to scale sustainably, don’t miss out!

And when fulfillment providers cannot keep up with brand growth, it can significantly affect customer experience, NPS scores, returns, and refund rates, to name a few. This is why merchants need to focus on building relationships instead of just working with their service providers. As Ninaad, Dan and Andrew discuss, building confidence on both sides includes having accurate invoicing and forecasting, thorough node strategy planning, and even in-person visits. </p><p>Why is this important?

of news….BigCommerce Reports Earnings\\nLast week BigCommerce reported its earnings and it looked to me like a steady improvement over the past year.Look, in some ways, BigCommerce is a bit like the Maytag Repairman of eCommerce.Not exciting on the outside, but a dependable software-as-a-service business on the inside.In other ways, BigCommerce is like the Rodney Dangerfield of eCommerce — it “Gets No Respect”.It is a solid platform that did not capture the eCommerce zeitgeist like Shopify.In its history, BigCommerce has had two primary issues.One, the company is not widely known.It still is not even included in many RFPs except in certain segments.Of course, this is a problem and an opportunity the company seems to recognize.It’s encouraging to hear Brent talking about turning off SMB marketing and activating field marketing and events for Enterprise customers.Two, BigCommerce is under-monetized.In the land of exciting business models and attach rates of the competition, BigCommerce is primarily a simple SaaS Enterprise play.So 2000s right?In the end, the best play for BigCommerce is probably a new acquirer, which I will not speculate on here.Still, private equity is the easiest bet to make, given the large number of growing, slightly unprofitable, high gross margin, SaaS Enterprise players who have been acquired in the last two years: Avalara and Zendesk to name only two, and there are more.It’s not required, mind you, but it would accelerate their trajectory.From a results point of view, there is a lot to like in BigCommerce’s earnings.For 2023 Q1 earnings, \\n* The company remains focused on raising its Average Revenue Per Account, up 11% year over year to $39K.This is a healthy raise from its previous $30K-$33K in the past, and indicates that management seems to understand the levers it has to improve this.* Total revenue was $71.8 million, up 9% compared to the first quarter of 2022.Pretty steady.* Increasing gross margins were reported.GAAP gross margin was 76%, compared to 74% in the first quarter of 2022.Non-GAAP gross margin was 77%, compared to 75% in the first quarter of 2022.* Feedonomics is also a good play for BigCommerce.It’s needed functionality if you are going to be merchant-centric, and it’s not easy to find reliable Enterprise partners (outside of ChannelAdvisor).There is one area BigCommerce outshines Shopify here: a connection to Amazon.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"X36sKBwrd58u9OD7aSc/TAL4iIff6cvssh+CVOb3yxs=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a778b85c-b5b1-4b5a-9e2a-7ac4057c241b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a778b85c-b5b1-4b5a-9e2a-7ac4057c241b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.rmwcommerce.com/podcast-episodes/may-15-2023-bigcommerce-reports-earnings-ebay-prepares-launch-of-international-shipping-program-flexport-is-missing-the-infrastructure-to-compete-with-large-players-and-amazon-gives-incentives\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"04b451bb-263d-4e40-8f6c-dd3b22373325\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.rmwcommerce.com/podcast-episodes/may-15-2023-bigcommerce-reports-earnings-ebay-prepares-launch-of-international-shipping-program-flexport-is-missing-the-infrastructure-to-compete-with-large-players-and-amazon-gives-incentives\"},\"hash\":\"4n55/xt8hO1b4BmQlNdiAhd4eAQtDbMQG2ueFCST9cA=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2a2a69dd-295e-4db5-8a07-79a30b302792\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.rmwcommerce.com/podcast-episodes/may-15-2023-bigcommerce-reports-earnings-ebay-prepares-launch-of-international-shipping-program-flexport-is-missing-the-infrastructure-to-compete-with-large-players-and-amazon-gives-incentives\"},\"hash\":\"X36sKBwrd58u9OD7aSc/TAL4iIff6cvssh+CVOb3yxs=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"81554e57-5157-4d72-a503-0c4dbda659ad\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"aYQMFfO8zzX0Ieup1hevhR/4O/XSk96DhCWvh1MkYdM=\"}},\"text\":\"This

first-party merchants still.After all, if you are in big-box retail, Amazon wants you in first-party more often than not.Having spent a career at ChannelAdvisor, it’s not an easy business to connect to marketplaces.But this functionality is essential with the near-constant updates to marketplaces.Shopify will need this same kind of connection to Amazon if it continues to move up-market.As part of a larger entity with more resources, the company could accelerate.It has a narrow focus which seems to be narrowing even further.With some marketing help and additional resources and talent, the company could be even better.[References:]\\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/ecommercestrategyconsulting_bigcommerce-saas-activity-7060246408817209344-QheM\\nhttps://investors.bigcommerce.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bigcommerce-announces-first-quarter-2023-financial-results\\nOur Second Story\\neBay Prepares Launch of International Shipping Program\\nIt looks like eBay is finally taking the wraps off its International Shipping (EIS) program in July of this year, with eBay migrating sellers to the program over the next few months.On a personal note, over 4 years ago now, I spent about 3 years at Pitney Bowes working with its cross-border software.What used to be called eBay Global Shipping Program, or GSP, used to be almost exclusively provided by Pitney Bowes.This has changed going forward to a set of partners.The big challenge with cross-border on a global marketplace like eBay is data.And by that I mean, the data provided by sellers is completely terrible.Which means all providers must work extra hard to estimate, guess, and learn, and all other manner of techniques – including manual work – to help make global eCommerce possible in such a scenario.eBay International Shipping is for the small sellers of the world – the job is to make it easy.Ebay sellers don't do much more than enable it on their listings, and ship normally.eBay takes care of the rest, including compliance, payments, duties and taxes, and delivery – all through an integrated network of partners.Cross-border shipping to 200+ countries for eBay sellers is the goal; existing sellers will be transitioned over the next few months with a hard cut-over on July 1.As far as providers for the program:\\n* Avalara is providing compliance, classification, and landed cost pricing – it's not exactly a surprise as Avalara has quite a number of ex-Borderfree and Pitney Bowes employees there for the past several years.So a big chunk of that heavy lifting Pitney Bowes used to do is now taken on by Avalara.It's hard to find a company with the global scope in these kinds of complex situations like Avalara.Alternatives are generally cobbling together multiple providers.* It also looks to me like eBay is supporting not just cross-dock freight forwarding through the US, but also direct international cross-border shipments from the seller's location with providers like EasyShip, which also announced support for the initiative.* It appears to me that (based on its press release), Pitney Bowes retained its contract as provider of eBay's Global Shipping Program in the United Kingdom.* I read that eBay is partnering up with a solution called ShipRocket in India.Here's to the next 10 years of eBay International Shipping supporting small and medium sellers across the globe.It really is one of the better programs in the industry supporting cross-border sellers.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"bVJHjePd/Uoq0a8cjmpN3NCX6ntpok+AuaJ9m3UkAiU=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"81554e57-5157-4d72-a503-0c4dbda659ad":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"81554e57-5157-4d72-a503-0c4dbda659ad\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.rmwcommerce.com/podcast-episodes/may-15-2023-bigcommerce-reports-earnings-ebay-prepares-launch-of-international-shipping-program-flexport-is-missing-the-infrastructure-to-compete-with-large-players-and-amazon-gives-incentives\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"04b451bb-263d-4e40-8f6c-dd3b22373325\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.rmwcommerce.com/podcast-episodes/may-15-2023-bigcommerce-reports-earnings-ebay-prepares-launch-of-international-shipping-program-flexport-is-missing-the-infrastructure-to-compete-with-large-players-and-amazon-gives-incentives\"},\"hash\":\"4n55/xt8hO1b4BmQlNdiAhd4eAQtDbMQG2ueFCST9cA=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a778b85c-b5b1-4b5a-9e2a-7ac4057c241b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.rmwcommerce.com/podcast-episodes/may-15-2023-bigcommerce-reports-earnings-ebay-prepares-launch-of-international-shipping-program-flexport-is-missing-the-infrastructure-to-compete-with-large-players-and-amazon-gives-incentives\"},\"hash\":\"lHmzRinFoyhH42jFV27WEGH5WtmSoeMU03/0fSqyUUM=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"25bfd32d-0767-47de-95ab-febd5726928d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"a8KmJ1midYDo3pfGfRjivQDFSXip05jWTaPj2pUR1vI=\"}},\"text\":\"So

Third Story\\nFlexport is Missing the Infrastructure to Compete with Large Players\\nWell, the dust has settled on the sale of Deliverr to Flexport, and I’m not so certain that this sale looks so great in the light of day for the acquirer.Yes, this extends Flexport's addressable market, but is it healthy?How is this anything but shuffling a few deck chairs around?A few days after the deal is done, a few questions remain.First, where is the infrastructure?The simple reality is that Deliverr does not operate its own facilities and does not control its own volume, so where will the volume come from?The biggest logistics players are investing in fixed assets.Dave Clark's assertion that shipping will happen for your eCommerce site, and your stores – I can't think of any math here that makes this equation work.Do you think eCommerce is a tough market to crack?Try store distribution.It's a 50+ year entrenched business with even slimmer margins.What is the size of the margin prize here?Forget the technology – if you pitched a VC on disrupting how people ship to a store, you would get laughed out of the room (if you could even get through the door).The only people who have innovated in shipping to stores in the past 10 years is Target, and it's because Target controls all sides of the network: the distribution center, the store, and the downstream sort facility.Long term, the only way this works is if Flexport can aggregate enough volume to afford to vertically integrate logistics, rather than push work to partners.Otherwise you are simply just another middleman: what are you operating?At some point, I expect an asset merger to pair with Flexport's technology.Perhaps private equity could make the tie-up.More must be coming.There is really only one path forward: Flexport needs to find a source of virtually guaranteed volume like signing all the global marketplaces as customers.The only challenge is many of them are logistics companies themselves.Again, more must be coming.Second, I’m left wondering what the terms of the deal between Shopify and Flexport are.I am expecting that other third-party logistics providers can still connect to Shopify, so this doesn't limit existing players.Re-reading Tobi's note about the sale of Deliverr to Flexport, he referred to Flexport as the preferred provider of logistics for Shopify.Preferred does not mean exclusive.Wouldn't it be in Shopify's best interest to shop this capability around to the best fulfillment provider for consumers, rather than simply the company that took Deliverr off its hands?Maybe Shopify still has this flexibility.It's also possible that Shopify now views Flexport in a similar way for logistics that it views Stripe for payments.Where does that leave the future merchant experience for brands that don't use the preferred provider?There is more to be revealed here, also.[References:]\\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/ecommercestrategyconsulting_flexport-shopify-activity-7061311207101603841-zIX1/\\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/shopify-tried-failed-to-challenge-amazon-in-logistics-2023-5\\n[PAUSE]\\nAnd

Our Last Story\\nAmazon Gives Shoppers Incentives to Pick Up Their Orders\\nApparently Amazon is testing a new service in the wild which was discovered by some customers.IIf you are willing to pick up your order from an Amazon pick-up location like Whole Foods or Kohl’s, then Amazon will give you a $10 incentive.An Amazon spokesperson said it's been testing for some time.This follows other Amazon incentives for changing your delivery activity.One of the most popular Amazon Prime incentives is a digital services credit for shipping items to you on a Friday.Another (dis)incentive that Amazon recently announced was that it will start charging the customer $1 when shipping a return back through a UPS store instead of a Whole Foods, if the Whole Foods is closer to the customer’s house.This program is a little different, however.This new incentive feels like a way to reduce shipping costs, except when you realize that losing $10 per order gets pretty expensive pretty fast.That is almost certainly higher than what it costs Amazon to ship an order end-to-end, so why such a high incentive?Here are two ideas for you.First, what if this is about reducing the company’s risk to Delivery Service Providers?What does this encourage?Larger B2B moves which could be handled by fuller truckloads, and avoiding the use of DSPs or Delivery Service Providers.What is the biggest flashpoint in supply chain these days?It’s labor.Costs are rising, and there is increasing risk that workers will unionize which will increase Amazon’s costs and reduce Amazon’s bargaining power, or Federal regulators will change their stance on Delivery Service Partners.To me that $10 could be seen as a risk reduction payment to reduce the company’s exposure to its Delivery Service Partner network if ever happens.It’s also not lost on me that most carriers are consolidating routes this year.If enough volume moves that it can cut back on routes, it could help win in other areas.Second, another thought would be that Amazon is testing the consumer response to its owned network, and how many customers would be willing to get out of their house to pick an order rather than have it delivered?From there, it can run all sorts of sensitivity analysis to learn if there is some correlation between distance from the customer’s home to the pickup facility, item value or type, or some other correlation that might help them determine how to optimize their network further — including when to open a new facility.While this isn’t a widespread program now, I might consider picking up $10 if it were offered to me in the future, or at least it might make me think twice if there was an Amazon pickup point nearby.It could also be a solution for porch pirates in certain areas in the United States.[References:]\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-offers-shoppers-10-pick-up-purchases-it-targets-delivery-costs-2023-05-08/\\n\\n[PAUSE]\\nWe’ll be right back after a word from

solutions provider EquipmentShare completed a $290 million funding round.ConstructionShare provides contractors visibility into all their operations on the job site.This includes things like bottlenecks in their fleets, machines that have gone offline, and job and equipment utilization reports.Although I am skeptical that there will be so many winners in this kind of visibility market, it is likely that there could be one winner for the industry given that customers tend to follow each other's solutions.Link:

a CEO.It’s really unclear to me how these connected fitness companies keep getting funding.Here are the details: A new $130 million raise from L Catterton.This is on top of a $250 million Series E the company raised in 2021, and the company now says it is REALLY CLOSE to profitability.Which I’m sure is exactly why they raised over $100 million, because they are so close to cash-flow breakeven.Link:

like it ripped off Shopify’s Shop Pay flow; it then even has a payment solution called Rallypay.But it is bringing this checkout to other platforms.At this point, it will go head-on with solutions like Bolt and Bold.It’s a tough market to crack as many people think that the eCommerce platform itself should provide a checkout solution.checkout/\\nFourth\\nAI-based computer vision company Groundlight raised a seed round.The company is solving an interesting problem – how to meld AI chatbot interfaces and the large amount of video and imagery that are inside of corporations.The goal would be for operators to be able to query what is happening in video streams using text, and receive answers to those queries with verification.Kind of a clever idea.Link:

platform Localz.Localz looks like a startup that was acquired for $6.2 million from Descartes, which is a large player in SaaS supply chain technology solutions for B2B applications.It seems to me this fills a gap in its offerings, which allows its customers to reschedule and be notified in real-time about a shipment’s progress.Link:

is one of the largest brand licensing firms in the world and it’s owned by Jamie Salter.Vince sold this for $76 million dollars to ABG, but still holds a 25% interest in the new entity.While Vince will pay an ongoing royalty fee to the new IP owner, it will also receive 25% of the cash generated by the business.If you’ve ever watched Shark Tank, this is one of those deals that Mr.Wonderful

software is doing and the magic is in the software, right?And so that's number one.Number two, we connect to software or robotic software is basically automating and making things faster and it doesn't necessarily need to involve a machine.It doesn't have to have an articulated arm robot.It can just be a mechanical system, right?So really what it's about is unlocking sensor data and putting it into this, what we see is us being the central nervous system.\\\"<br />[00:16:39] \\\"So the first thing I think a lot of people misunderstand is.Now we're connected.What's the next challenge we have to think about?We're going to maintain that system's health, right?Because now we're running an automation facility and you were talking about 120, 140 picks an hour from your baseline.Okay.Now I have that ROI, that clock's ticking.I need to make sure that we're at that 100 to 200, 124 picks all day long.And a lot of automation systems, it's making sure that silent failures aren't happening in your system.So a lot of times maybe you're a bad data from a wrong order structure or something like that.One system doesn't like the data that's being exchanged.A lot of times that's happened.That's silently failing in the background.\\\"</p><p><strong>Find out more about A.K.Schultz and Nick Leonard in the links below.</strong></p><p>A.K.Schultz’s LinkedIn Profile: <a

magic is in the software, right?And so that's number one.Number two, we connect to software or robotic software is basically automating and making things faster and it doesn't necessarily need to involve a machine.It doesn't have to have an articulated arm robot.It can just be a mechanical system, right?So really what it's about is unlocking sensor data and putting it into this, what we see is

health, right?Because now we're running an automation facility and you were talking about 120, 140 picks an hour from your baseline.Okay.Now I have that ROI, that clock's ticking.I need to make sure that we're at that 100 to 200, 124 picks all day long.And a lot of automation systems, it's making sure that silent failures aren't happening in your system.So a lot of times maybe you're a bad data from a wrong order structure or something like that.One system doesn't like the data that's being exchanged.A lot of times that's happened.That's silently failing in the background.\\\"</p><p><strong>Find out more about A.K.Schultz and Nick Leonard in the links below.</strong></p><p>A.K.Schultz’s LinkedIn Profile: <a

this episode, Simon Kalouche, founder and CEO of Nimble, joins the hosts to discuss the future of ecommerce logistics and the role of automation and robotics.Simon emphasizes the importance of automating core warehouse processes while acknowledging the challenges of handling edge cases.He shares his background in robotics and the application of deep learning in the field.Simon also highlights the potential of gecko adhesive technology for gripping and handling objects in logistics.The conversation explores the need for warehouses designed for robots and the vision of creating fully autonomous warehouses.Simon concludes by emphasizing the value of human involvement in the evolving landscape of ecommerce logistics.ABOUT SIMON Simon founded Nimble in 2017 after dropping out of his PhD at Stanford.He's spent the last 5 years inventing and scaling intelligent next-gen autonomous logistics systems.Previously Simon led development of dynamic legged robots for the Department of Defense while completing his masters in robotics at Carnegie Mellon, International Space Station robots for NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab and autonomous off-road vehicles for the Air Force Research Lab.HIGHLIGHTS If you try to automate all the one-offs, your warehouse will end up costing way too much.There's always edge cases and one-off things you have to solve for in logistics.Deep Imitation Learning allows robots to learn tasks through human demonstration.Designing warehouses conducive to robots opens up new possibilities for automation.The future of ecommerce logistics lies in a balance between automation and human involvement.QUOTES Real-World Automation Strategist, Variability Management Specialist.Simon: “I saw an opportunity to deploy this in the real world.There are so many monotonous, repetitive tasks out in the real world that are, you know, that are very repetitive, but yet too hard to automate because there's a lot of variability involved.And eCommerce to film is a classic example, right?If you think about a warehouse.You know, all day long is picking and packing and picking and packing.Uh, but the part that makes that task hard to automate is that you could be picking and packing 10 million or 20 million different objects, right?And every object has a different size and shape and weight and texture and stiffness and something you're fragile.”Labor Optimization, Warehouse Automation.Simon: “Running a warehouse today is very hard because of the labor problem, right?The, it's, it's very hard to find, to recruit, to train and to retain hundreds or

<p>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Sucharita Kodali, Vice President and Principal Analyst at Forrester Research.Today, she shares a wealth of knowledge on retail and the consumer goods space.We go through topics including trends in the ecommerce and retail world today, strategies for retention and improvement, and the potential of technology in the space.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT SUCHARITA</strong></p><p>Sucharita serves digital business strategy professionals.She is an expert in e-commerce, omnichannel commerce, consumer behavior, and trends in the retail and consumer goods space.She is also an authority on technology developments that affect the online commerce industry and vendors that facilitate online marketing and merchandising.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In her research, Sucharita covers areas such as e-commerce trends and global, regulatory, and technology issues shaping commerce.She is the author of Forrester’s “The World’s Most Future-Proofed Brands” report, which reviews global consumer-facing brand manufacturers.She is often the keynote speaker at retailer conferences around the world and is frequently featured in national media such as NPR, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Bloomberg Businessweek, The Information, and more.</p><p><br /> </p><p>Prior to Forrester, Sucharita was the director of marketing at Saks Fifth Avenue, where she managed the customer acquisition, retention, and market research efforts for the $2 billion luxury retailer's online channel.Prior to Saks, she held management positions at Toys R Us, where she was a merchant in the Babies R Us division and a store manager in one of the company's largest toy stores.She also worked for the Walt Disney Company, where she was part of the strategic planning team.</p><p> </p><p>Sucharita holds a BA in economics from Harvard University and an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p><p><br /> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>02:18 How Sucharita's journey in retail started</li><li>09:10 The boom in online commerce during the pandemic</li><li>14:51 The bullwhip effect in retail supply chain recently</li><li>21:05 Can we expect more automation and robotics in warehousing?</li><li>27:07 Don't try to match what Amazon is doing</li><li>34:24 Will there be conflict in CPG when working with consumers and being a direct-to-consumer brand?</li></ul><p><br /> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p>16:58 <strong>Don't diversify only when there are issues</strong> - Sucharita: \\\"One of the things we learned from the pandemic was that maybe we are too concentrated with our supply chains in Asia, particularly in China, then you add on some of the geopolitical issues.I think companies are gradually recognizing that maybe they do need to diversify their supply chains.But it's a painful decision to have to make because then you have to increase the costs of your inputs.\\\"</p><p><br /> </p><p>27:07 <strong>Look inward instead of trying to compete with top players like Amazon</strong> - Sucharita: \\\"I think that the companies that created a lot of the frenzy around shipping were the ones that fundamentally didn't really have differentiated offerings.They were selling the same things Amazon is selling and net-net all being equal, if you are slower

Director of the Distribution Center in a unionized environment and successfully led 200+ members to the best-engaged building in the country.This was when Prashant tasted the success of being a leader in the distribution and logistics role and found his real passion in the supply chain world.From this moment, the sky was the limit and he worked in Bed Bath and Beyond, Drive Medical and Lasership as Head of Supply Chain.In his current role in SwagUp, his vision while it aligns with CEO and Founder of SwagUp, Michael Martocci, is to become a $1Billon company within 5

form different cultures, backgrounds, ethnicities, and so for.That really preps them for the camaraderie piece because you're literally having your life put in somebody's hands and you have each other's back.\\\"Going from zero to ninety-nine is tremendous, especially with personnel - Prashant: \\\"If we want to get to 99-100%, then I will need additional individuals.But who is going to volunteer to go to Afghanistan and stay with me for 6 months?So getting to the preparation, we need to be 100% so that way we don't need additional personnel so they can be used somewhere else.The mindset is we don't have anybody, that's all you have.Whatever you see, that's it.\\\"Find out more about Prashant in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/prashant-shah-mba/ Website:

price.And one of the main ones is supply.And if you can't get supply, no matter how much it costs, it does you no good because you're not gonna have anything to manufacture.\\\"30:54 Use niche tools to prevent supplier misses - Sarah: \\\"When a company is issuing a purchase order, 52% of the time, our research has shown from the usage of our platform that line items change.So if I'm issuing a purchase order with a hundred line items, we're saying that on average, 52 of those hundred line items are going to have have changes, and that means then, significant back and forth via email and

this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Brittain Ladd, Strategy Advisor Shatranj Capital Partners.Brittain's no-holds-barred insights on management and logistics have not only captured people's attention, but they have also even proven to be accurate given how many of his predictions have come true.</p><p>He discusses some of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, Twitter, and TikTok, and gives hot takes on what they are doing wrong and how they can make it right.He comments on the recent layoffs at Amazon and how he believes it is only the beginning and a symptom of a much larger shift that will affect entire industries worldwide.</p><p>Brittain then digs into how partnerships can change e-commerce by providing social commerce platforms the established fulfillment infrastructure they need to deliver goods to the consumer.He also discusses in great detail the flaws of the quick commerce model and how fulfillment should be a question of accurate delivery versus quick delivery.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT BRITTAIN</strong></p><p>Brittain has 20 years of experience in supply chain management and logistics.He has lived and worked in China, India, Africa, Saudi Arabia, Europe, and the United States.Brittain is a global strategy and supply chain consultant and a writer for Forbes and his own website, brittainladd.com.Brittain is also recognized as being one of the most accurate analysts in business.</p><p>He successfully predicted multiple major acquisitions more than a year in advance of them occurring, including Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods, Microsoft and Walmart partnering to bid on TikTok, and most recently, Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.Brittain is frequently quoted in the press and often appears on major news networks like CNN, Fox Business, and the BBC.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><p>- 01:37 Posting thought-provoking ideas and predictions on social media</p><p>- 08:52 Amazon's mistake and getting down to its optimal fighting weight </p><p>- 18:47 Twitter can change e-commerce with shoppable videos</p><p>- 25:43 Instead of creating their own fulfillment, TiktTok should partner with Amazon/Walmart/Target/Shopify </p><p>- 35:42 Quick commerce is a failure: Fast delivery vs accurate delivery </p><p> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p>23:51 Shoppable videos can save Twitter - Brittain: \\\"I believe the way that Elon Musk saves Twitter and makes Twitter completely different is through shoppable videos and, I think, absolutely, that what Elon Musk should be doing is we need short-form videos, shoppable videos, and for every shoppable video we put on Twitter, we take 12% of all sales, and I think the goal should be for every shoppable video that Elon Musk puts on Twitter, that it generates 100 to 250 million in sales.\\\"\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ku9kL44ZWZsvexX1fOdelgOu/RsxJDKG/M6rz5LMlcI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9fb222b8-d9f6-440f-9e17-a49bbb0ea7c5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9fb222b8-d9f6-440f-9e17-a49bbb0ea7c5\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/8VMlhZbS\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"4c7f28c5-7177-40c2-9984-b7881510c7fe\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/8VMlhZbS\"},\"hash\":\"Ou2PMRlSW3rWzt3Fb6NqVKmn/9AgeqfcxztDerHPCqo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"3502bdb1-09f9-44d2-a1a4-e05d9ff3a608\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/8VMlhZbS\"},\"hash\":\"13sY4aT55/AO9KtLmiAz3hxobQyAW5MQzGgr9fhgonA=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"2af23458-cee6-4489-8ba0-617daa325538\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"3tbw8Zc4A6F4h2mf+/CVZoQzjHIKcGKC3hfs6mGbwwE=\"}},\"text\":\"</p><p>25:50 TikTok should acquire Shopify for its fulfillment infrastructure - Brittain: \\\"I think, number one, TikTok needs to do something above and beyond than just opening up their own fulfillment centers.I think what TikTok needs to do is, again, change how commerce is done on the platform.So I think what would be very interesting is if TikTok acquires Shopify, so where now I have Shopify, I have a Shopify storefront on TikTok, and so then what happens is I immediately see a video come across but it's a video from a storefront, and without having to go to a website, I see it, I buy it.And that's how I refer to what I think is the next big thing in commerce.I say see, buy.I see it, I buy it.I'm not going to websites.\\\"</p><p> </p><p>Find out more about <strong>Brittain</strong> in the links

https://sourcingjournal.com/</itunes:summary>\\n<itunes:subtitle>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Edward Hertzman, Executive Vice President of Fairchild Media and Founder and President of Sourcing Journal.Edward shares the trends in supply chain he is observing today post-COVID and beyond.From the way Amazon changed logistics forever and its effects in consumer expectations as a result, to the importance of remaining agile and how to do it, Edward takes a deep dive into how global supply chains will look like in the near future and how to maintain inventory to scale.ABOUT EDWARD Edward Hertzman received a degree in economics from NYU and spent more than a decade working as a top executive for major sourcing companies all over the world, including Synergies Worldwide and Pearl Global.Hertzman sits on the Board for Delivering Good, a charitable organization that channels the resources of the fashion industry to those in need.In 2009, in response to a need in the industry, he founded Sourcing Journal Online.With more than 75,000 subscribers, Sourcing Journal Online is the largest trade journal devoted to the sourcing apparel and textile industry supply chain in the world.In August 2020, he was promoted to executive vice president of Fairchild Media, tasked with growing the businesses of all Fairchild Media titles in his new position, while continuing to lead the day-to-day operations at Sourcing Journal.He will also oversee the growth of Fairchild Media’s strategic content studio, bolstering the creation of engaging, interactive content to help industry partners stand out in an increasingly competitive landscape.HIGHLIGHTS 07:07 DTC is dying and mergers are set to happen 13:08 Surviving devaluation and managing inventory for what's to come 20:23 Keeping sourcing lean and agile in fashion 25:23 Nearshoring and diversifying manufacturing and sourcing capabilities 30:22 Regulations and sharing the responsibility of sustainability in supply chain management QUOTES 14:27 On pushing back on the growth-at-all-costs mindset, Edward says, \\\"Just don't acquire customers saying, Oh, the lifetime value is X and never really realize that.Don't buy inventory without testing the product.Find retail partners that are gonna support you, not just be transactional.\\\"31:09 As regulations will push for tangible sustainability measures from retail, Edward says, \\\"I think there's only two ways to incentivize people or two ways to get people to change.One is through incentive and one is through repercussions.And what I mean by that is either you're gonna pay me more to do something or you're gonna punish me for not doing it.\\\"39:48 To survive the recession, Edward suggests, \\\"I think

this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Chad Rubin, Founder and CEO of Profasee.As one of the pioneering Amazon sellers, Chad has kept up with the updates over the years and now offers a dynamic pricing platform to enable Amazon brands to predict the perfect price at each precise moment.Chad dives into how data science is the competitive advantage brands need to profit on Amazon.He highlights that brands should embrace Amazon as it simply is the best place to meet buyers where they are buying.Finally, Chad discusses how Shopify and Amazon can coexist and how AWD is changing the 3PL game.HIGHLIGHTS 04:08 Solving problems: Find friction first then refine the solution 10:40 Selling on Amazon is profitable with data science as a competitive advantage 24:31 Brands should meet buyers where they buy, which is Amazon 30:39 Fix the pricing of AWD and it will dominate the market 40:34 Shopify and Amazon can coexist in the same space QUOTES 19:35 Data science is the competitive advantage for selling on Amazon - Chad: “The strong will survive and one of the ways of being strong is actually getting an edge.And that edge right now, the only edge that they're gonna be able to get, because if Thrasio has 20,000 SKUs to manage, they need data science.”26:53 Offer Amazon exclusives for social proof - Chad: “People go on Amazon, a lot of times they never leave Amazon.So perhaps it's important you have your exclusives, let's just say your Caraway and you're selling pots and pans in Shopify.”“And you have some really beautiful, elegant product.Well, put your hero SKU or your economy SKU on Amazon because then you get social proof and you have your other color variations maybe off Amazon.”45:20 Shopify and Amazon can coexist to address different segments of the market - Chad: \\\"I believe that you can coexist in the world and be on Amazon and have your own storefront simultaneously and add different value.And, certainly, you can do a lot more experimentation with your own Shopify site.But I don't think that they're mutually exclusive anymore.\\\"Find out more about Chad in the links below: LinkedIn:

got to be able to have the hook in 30 seconds.And that's one.”\\\"Two, it's not just the story.There's also the substance which is a proof-point of success.I've got a lot of decks and, generally speaking, the ones that I'm the most interested in are ones where the deck shows a simple statement of what's the problem, what's their solution, customer case study, and clear results.\\\"Find out
