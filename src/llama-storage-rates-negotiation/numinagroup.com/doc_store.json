Small parcel shipping refers to the delivery service of small, lightweight parcels or packages that typically weigh less than 70 pounds but, depending upon the carrier’s service offerings, may weigh up to 150 pounds.\\nSmall parcel shipping comprises a large percentage of e-commerce and omnichannel B2B and B2C deliveries. The process of picking, packing, and shipping parcel shipments can be labor-intensive in manual fulfillment operations but can be efficiently managed by an automated warehouse system.\\nParcel Shipment Packaging\\nParcel shipment packaging types include cardboard boxes, envelopes, and soft pouches. The shipper usually provides the packaging for small parcel shipping, although the carrier may offer it. For example, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) provides a range of small USPS-branded boxes and pouches in multiple sizes to shippers at no cost. If the shipper provides the packaging, it must meet specific requirements, such as weight and size limits and other requirements defined by each carrier.\\nBlog: How to Automate Pack and Ship Labeling Operations\\nParcel Shipping Services\\nSmall parcel shipping services are offered by a range of global, national, regional, and local carriers, including the United States Postal Service) UPS, FedEx, or DHL. Parcel delivery services include a broad range of service levels, such as standard ground, two-day, next, and same-day delivery.\\nAdditional services include insurance, package tracking, and other accessorial services. The cost of shipping a parcel depends on factors such as the dimensions and weight of the parcel, the distance it needs to travel from the origin point to the delivery point, the required delivery date, etc.\\nParcel shipments are not typically palletized, although in cases where a company is shipping large enough volumes of identical goods to a single destination, it may be possible to consolidate them onto a pallet and them via freight for a more economical cost.\\nParcel Shipping Compared to Freight Shipping\\nPackage delivery differs from freight shipping in the following ways.\\nParcel Shipping\\nParcel shipping is a service offered by numerous commercial carriers such as USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DHL. Small packages, such as parcels, are the main contents of a package truck, which may contain anywhere between 50 and 100 parcels, depending on the average package size. Examples include direct-to-consumer orders, e-commerce shipments, and documents.\\nA parcel delivery truck follows a delivery route that includes multiple daily stops, delivering orders to residential and business locations.\\nRates are based on package weight dimensions, delivery requirements, and additional services.\\nThe orders carried are typically less than 150 pounds.\\nThe trucks are usually no longer than 28 feet.\\nFreight Shipping\\nFreight shipments are delivered by numerous commercial freight carriers such as Yellow, ABF, and Pilot.\\nFreight shipments may be a single stop, from point A to point B, or as part of a multi-stop shipment.\\nFreight shipments are generally large loads, such as multiple products or orders consolidated and palletized on freight pallets. Examples include large industrial products, wholesale deliveries such as consolidated large furniture shipments to a retail store, and bulk products such as chemicals.\\nFreight shipments may be less-than-truckload (LTL) or full-truckload (TL) orders.\\nLTL freight rates are based on weight, dimensions, distance traveled, and additional services. TL rates are based on mileage.\\nA typical large haul freight shipment can weigh from 5,000 to 70,000 pounds.\\nOversized loads can weigh well over 110,000 pounds.\\nParcel and freight-based shipping modes are important for omnichannel order fulfillment operations companies. One best practice to maximize pick, pack, and ship efficiency and ensure lowest cost shipping on all orders is to integrate a multi-modal shipping system into your overall automated warehouse platform.\\nLearn More\\nNumina Group’s RDS™ is a modular and scalable software suite for warehouse automation software solutions optimized to streamline the entire pick, pack, and ship order fulfillment operation.

Small parcel shipping refers to the delivery service of small, lightweight parcels or packages that typically weigh less than 70 pounds but, depending upon the carrier’s service offerings, may weigh up to 150 pounds.\\nSmall parcel shipping comprises a large percentage of e-commerce and omnichannel B2B and B2C deliveries. The process of picking, packing, and shipping parcel shipments can be labor-intensive in manual fulfillment operations but can be efficiently managed by an automated warehouse system.\\nParcel Shipment Packaging\\nParcel shipment packaging types include cardboard boxes, envelopes, and soft pouches. The shipper usually provides the packaging for small parcel shipping, although the carrier may offer it. For example, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) provides a range of small USPS-branded boxes and pouches in multiple sizes to shippers at no cost. If the shipper provides the packaging, it must meet specific requirements, such as weight and size limits and other requirements defined by each carrier.\\nBlog: How to Automate Pack and Ship Labeling Operations\\nParcel Shipping Services\\nSmall parcel shipping services are offered by a range of global, national, regional, and local carriers, including the United States Postal Service) UPS, FedEx, or DHL. Parcel delivery services include a broad range of service levels, such as standard ground, two-day, next, and same-day delivery.\\nAdditional services include insurance, package tracking, and other accessorial services. The cost of shipping a parcel depends on factors such as the dimensions and weight of the parcel, the distance it needs to travel from the origin point to the delivery point, the required delivery date, etc.\\nParcel shipments are not typically palletized, although in cases where a company is shipping large enough volumes of identical goods to a single destination, it may be possible to consolidate them onto a pallet and them via freight for a more economical cost.\\nParcel Shipping Compared to Freight Shipping\\nPackage delivery differs from freight shipping in the following ways.\\nParcel Shipping\\nParcel shipping is a service offered by numerous commercial carriers such as USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DHL. Small packages, such as parcels, are the main contents of a package truck, which may contain anywhere between 50 and 100 parcels, depending on the average package size. Examples include direct-to-consumer orders, e-commerce shipments, and documents.\\nA parcel delivery truck follows a delivery route that includes multiple daily stops, delivering orders to residential and business locations.\\nRates are based on package weight dimensions, delivery requirements, and additional services.\\nThe orders carried are typically less than 150 pounds.\\nThe trucks are usually no longer than 28 feet.\\nFreight Shipping\\nFreight shipments are delivered by numerous commercial freight carriers such as Yellow, ABF, and Pilot.\\nFreight shipments may be a single stop, from point A to point B, or as part of a multi-stop shipment.\\nFreight shipments are generally large loads, such as multiple products or orders consolidated and palletized on freight pallets. Examples include large industrial products, wholesale deliveries such as consolidated large furniture shipments to a retail store, and bulk products such as chemicals.\\nFreight shipments may be less-than-truckload (LTL) or full-truckload (TL) orders.\\nLTL freight rates are based on weight, dimensions, distance traveled, and additional services. TL rates are based on mileage.\\nA typical large haul freight shipment can weigh from 5,000 to 70,000 pounds.\\nOversized loads can weigh well over 110,000 pounds.\\nParcel and freight-based shipping modes are important for omnichannel order fulfillment operations companies. One best practice to maximize pick, pack, and ship efficiency and ensure lowest cost shipping on all orders is to integrate a multi-modal shipping system into your overall automated warehouse platform.\\nLearn More\\nNumina Group’s RDS™ is a modular and scalable software suite for warehouse automation software solutions optimized to streamline the entire pick, pack, and ship order fulfillment operation.

PROVIDED BY\\nThe Numina Group\\nAug 06, 2015, 06:00 ET\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\\nDan Hanrahan\\n\\nWoodridge, IL (PRWEB) August 06, 2015 -- The Numina Group today announced that it has released advanced cartonization software that delivers enhanced order fulfillment efficiencies and operational cost savings over many of today’s existing solutions.The new software includes an advanced algorithm to determine the optimal shipping carton size for the greatest packing efficiency and lowest shipping costs.The software also works well as an audit tool to detect discrepancies in planned versus actual dimensions on outbound shipments, a common source of expensive carrier charge backs.“One company with a large retail distribution operation estimates they will save over $300,000 in shipping costs by using our new cartonization software.”Post this\\nSELECT THE RIGHT CARTON UPFRONT -- Before order release, Numina’s cartonization software analyzes order data and calculates the optimal shipping carton size before orders are picked, making it possible for warehouse staff to pick directly into the final shipping carton rather than an interim picking tote.“This is the leanest pick method for the majority of picking applications,” said Dan Hanrahan, Numina Group’s CEO.“When shippers can eliminate the use of totes and the redundant repacking of orders, the efficiency gains and cost savings are tremendous.”Numina’s intelligent carton cubing software can also verify full case pick to conveyor applications to validate picking and reduce shipping costs.According to Hanrahan, “One company with a large retail distribution operation estimates they will save over $300,000 in shipping costs by using our new cartonization software.”BIN MODELING VS FLUID MODELING CARTONIZATION LOGIC -- Most legacy cartonization software is based on the fluid model, which simply adds up the item volumes and compares the sum to the total volume of the carton.“This software model typically requires specific rules for some SKUs so it requires higher software support and customization to produce reasonable results,” said Hanrahan.“For example, setting the fill factor too high will yield inaccurate cartonization results and expensive extra steps in the pick-and-pack process.”Numina’s new cartonization software is based instead on an advanced bin modeling algorithm that eliminates these limitations.It produces only SKU selection results that can truly fit into the selected carton size.It also much more closely achieves 100% fill ratios than fluid modeling solutions.The software can perform cartonization over any set of available containers and will optimize the total number and size of cartons to minimize shipping costs.BUILT-IN REAL-TIME ORDER And SHIPMENT VALIDATION -- In addition to its “pick to carton” capabilities with built-in SKU and count validation, Numina’s software also works well to monitor planned versus actual dimensional weights on outbound shipments, and detect discrepancies due to pick errors or SKU changes.The software can be integrated with an in-line weighing and dimensioning system to verify expected carton size and weight as shipping cartons travel to the pack lines for document insertion, void fill and taping.This method can be used for split case picks and is extremely valuable for verifying full case picking.ACCURATE SHIPPING COSTS PRE-SHIPMENT -- Numina’s cartonization software, when integrated with an order fulfillment system, delivers real-time order inspection and results in more accurate LTL and parcel shipping costs.Shipping cost calculations are based on actual dimensional weight measurements, eliminating the risk of expensive charge backs or lost revenue.The Numina Group is one of a handful of suppliers with both cartonization software for pick to carton and carton cube/weight measurement combined with real-time control and conveyor sorting decisions.“Our software, integrated with existing ERP and/or WMS systems, can improve accuracy and reduce labor and shipping costs in existing or new DC operations,” said Hanrahan.FULL CASE PICK VALIDATION CATCHES MISS-PICKS -- Companies that ship a high percentage of full-case SKUs can use the software’s “learn mode” to on-line capture and learn full case SKU cube and weight.This eliminates the labor-intensive tasks of manual dimensional weight data collection.Additionally, once the SKU characteristics are learned, the software performs pick validation and can catch miss-picks in orders.This data can also be used to manage print and apply labeling of carrier or retail compliance shipping labels and improve other operations such as staging, storage space planning and cubing trailers for LTL or full truckload
