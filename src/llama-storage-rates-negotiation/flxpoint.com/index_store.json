on\nEmail\nLast updated on October 7th, 2024 at 05:39 am\nAutomated order routing uses advanced algorithms to figure out the best fulfillment center to process and ship orders.This technology brings together real-time data on inventory amounts, shipping costs, and delivery times to make smart choices.The result?Major cuts in shipping expenses and faster delivery speeds – key benefits for growing e-commerce companies.Understanding Automated Order Routing in E-commerce\nYou’re probably not new to the idea of order routing, but you might not know much about automated order routing.This technology uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to change how you manage your order distribution, leading to big cuts in shipping costs and faster delivery times.What is Automated Order Routing?Automated order routing refers to the use of technology to determine the best fulfillment center for processing and shipping an order.Unlike manual routing processes, which often rely on static rules or human decision-making, automated order routing uses real-time data and complex algorithms to make quick, smart, and cost-effective decisions.The system integrates seamlessly with several key parts:\nOrder management systems (OMS): These serve as the central hub for order intake, processing, and tracking, ensuring all orders are properly accounted for and directed.Inventory Tracking: This part provides real-time visibility into stock levels across multiple fulfillment centers, enabling the system to route orders to locations with available inventory, thereby minimizing stockouts and backorders.Carrier Integration: By comparing rates and transit times from various shipping carriers, the system selects the most efficient and economical shipping options, optimizing both cost and delivery speed.At its core, automated order routing employs sophisticated algorithms and machine learning models to analyze numerous factors and make the best routing decisions.These factors include distance, shipping zones, carrier transit times, and warehouse capacity.A primary strategy used in automated order routing is proximity-based routing.This approach prioritizes fulfilling orders from the nearest available facility to the customer, thereby reducing shipping distances, minimizing costs, and shortening delivery times.Proximity-based routing algorithms consider several important factors:\nDistance: The physical distance between the fulfillment center and the customer’s location is a key consideration in the routing decision.Shipping Zones: Different regions may have varying shipping costs and transit times, which the system takes into account when making routing decisions.Carrier Transit Times: The system considers the time it takes for a carrier to deliver a package from the fulfillment center to the customer’s location, ensuring quick delivery.Geolocation and mapping technologies enhance these routing decisions by providing accurate and real-time data on distances and transit times.Moreover, the system balances proximity with other factors like stock availability and shipping costs, ensuring that orders are not only routed efficiently but also cost-effectively.Real-time inventory visibility across multiple fulfillment centers is crucial in this process.By continuously monitoring stock levels, the system can dynamically adjust routing decisions to prevent stockouts and backorders, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.For instance, consider an e-commerce retailer with fulfillment centers in both Los Angeles and New York.An order placed by a customer in Chicago would typically be routed to the Los Angeles center based on proximity.However, if the Los Angeles center is experiencing a stockout of the requested item, the system would swiftly reroute the order to the New York center, despite the slightly longer transit time, ensuring quick delivery and maintaining customer satisfaction.The Mechanics of Automated Order Routing\nAutomated order routing is a process that helps businesses decide where to send their orders for the fastest and cheapest delivery.It uses advanced technology and data to make smart decisions about which fulfillment center should handle each order.Proximity-Based Routing: Sending from the Nearest Location\nProximity-based routing is the main part of automated order routing.It looks at how far apart places are, which shipping areas they’re in, and how long it takes to get things from one place to another.Special tools like geolocation and maps help figure out the best route.But it’s not just about how far away things are.The system also knows in real-time how much inventory is available in each fulfillment center.It helps the system make sure that orders go to places where the products are available, so customers don’t have to wait.Order Bundling and Consolidation Strategies\nBundling and consolidating orders is important for automated order routing.By putting multiple orders together, businesses can cut down on shipping costs and make packaging more efficient.But how do you decide which orders to put together?That’s where computer algorithms come in.These advanced algorithms look at order data and find ways to group orders together.They look at things like when the orders were placed, where they’re going, and what kind of products they have.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qNVo/DgSOmZfRxKfdolo0FclD56jrL5tdaxtPwlM358="},"002caa9c-75fd-4060-a749-a5a7ec08a3ba":{"id_":"002caa9c-75fd-4060-a749-a5a7ec08a3ba","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/smart-order-routing-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9af3931d-35c0-487e-b76f-e37862ed8183","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/smart-order-routing-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"bo7t0bnyVrQPSWj0sJqSyvdNp7OWYvxJUzNs3FuBtVQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2c87b400-74fe-4c04-a4ea-dcb5746dcc20","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/smart-order-routing-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"qNVo/DgSOmZfRxKfdolo0FclD56jrL5tdaxtPwlM358="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"13f87f18-39aa-42e1-8e09-683797b3654c","metadata":{},"hash":"t1GQx7/ai0MwQ9OjtNHI8N9ogNCErnts9iAMYMI6klY="}},"text":"It

at the same time and putting them together.Destination-based bundling: Putting orders together that are going to the same place or nearby.Product category-based bundling: Grouping similar products together to make packaging and handling easier.Bundling also helps the environment by cutting down on the number of shipments, which means less waste and a smaller carbon footprint.Smart Carrier Selection\nThe final component of intelligent order distribution is smart carrier selection.It means connecting with lots of different shipping companies to compare their prices and services in real-time, so each order goes with the cheapest and fastest carrier.When choosing a carrier, the system looks at things like what kind of service they offer, how long they take, and their track record.It balances cost with how fast they can deliver, so customer expectations are met while still saving money.The system also handles special shipping needs, like big or dangerous items.It knows which carriers can handle those kinds of shipments and makes sure they get there safely.Quantifying the Benefits of Automated Order Routing\nYou face many challenges in improving your shipping operations.One important challenge is quantifying the benefits of automated order routing.To do this effectively, you need to consider several key factors that contribute to better efficiency, cost

that fast shipping has become a standard expectation rather than a unique differentiator.Environmental Impact and Benefits\nAutomated order routing also offers substantial environmental benefits.By optimizing routes and consolidating shipments, you can lower your carbon footprint.Improved packaging consolidation results in less packaging waste, aligning with corporate environmental goals and consumer values focused on responsibility.By optimizing routes and reducing the number of shipments, you can make a significant impact on reducing your carbon footprint.Moreover, by aligning with consumer values on environmental responsibility, you can improve your brand reputation and attract environmentally conscious customers.Implementing Automated Order Routing in Your Business\nWhen you’re setting up automated order routing, there are a few important things to think about.First, you need to choose the right system for your business.Selecting the Right Automated Routing System\nTo choose the right system, you need to consider a few key things.You want a system that shows you your inventory in real-time across all locations.This helps you keep track of what you have in stock and prevents you from running out or having too much.Being able to work with many different carriers and compare their rates is also important.This helps you pick the best shipping option for each order, both in terms of cost and speed.Having good analytics and reporting tools is also crucial.These help you keep track of how well the system is working and where you can improve.You also want a system that lets you set your own rules and parameters.This allows you to tailor the system to fit your specific business needs.It’s also important that the system can work well with your existing e-commerce platforms and enterprise resource planning systems.When you’re choosing a system, think about how well it will scale with your business.As you grow, the system should be able to handle more orders and adapt to new situations without causing problems.Will it work well if you open new locations or expand into new markets?Will it handle new types of products or services easily?Decide between a cloud-based system or one you run on your own hardware.Cloud-based systems are easier to grow with and don’t need a lot of IT work, but you pay a fee every month.Systems you run yourself give you more control but cost more upfront and need regular maintenance.Navigating Implementation Challenges\nSetting up automated order routing can be tricky.One of the biggest challenges is moving data from old systems to the new one and making sure it’s clean.This can be complex.You need a good plan for moving data and cleaning it up so it’s accurate and doesn’t cause any problems in the new system.Training your staff and helping them adapt to the new system is also important.Introducing new systems means you need to train everyone thoroughly.You should have a good training plan and ways to handle any resistance or changes.Making sure the new system works well with what you already have is another challenge.The new system needs to be able to connect with your existing systems through what’s called an “API” (application programming interface).This helps everything work together smoothly.Getting your inventory just right is also key.You need to be sure your data is accurate so orders are processed correctly.You should do a thorough inventory check and get everything in sync when you start.To make the transition smoother, try starting with a small test group first.This helps you find and fix any problems before you expand.Have a person in charge of the whole process and get all the important people involved along the way.Set realistic times for getting everything up and running.It usually takes a few months to fully get started and really make the most of the new system.Make a timeline with clear milestones to check your progress.Be clear and honest about costs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"uPpcAQwQUSeP/aCY7VxcCOVRVHZ1O4dcxV32s1vawVM="},"91bdedb3-71b0-441c-9cc5-358e6a39ceca":{"id_":"91bdedb3-71b0-441c-9cc5-358e6a39ceca","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/smart-order-routing-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9af3931d-35c0-487e-b76f-e37862ed8183","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/smart-order-routing-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"bo7t0bnyVrQPSWj0sJqSyvdNp7OWYvxJUzNs3FuBtVQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"13f87f18-39aa-42e1-8e09-683797b3654c","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/smart-order-routing-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"t1GQx7/ai0MwQ9OjtNHI8N9ogNCErnts9iAMYMI6klY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"70acfeb4-2323-45a9-a6a5-abe476f4bb88","metadata":{},"hash":"CQkG6+Cg2hA7EYk0OLGCXdZ4+2K0ewJJ9bGKPVoF+Pw="}},"text":"You

Cases\nPricing\nResources\nLog In\n\nWhat is Kitting & Bundling?\nKitting and bundling is the process of grouping items together and selling them as a single, bundled product.\nWhere they differ is the products. Grouping usually-separate items creates a product kit, while combining multiple identical items creates a product bundling.\nCreating product kits allows you to create additional listings for those products. When you also sell each product individually, you double your listing exposure. More exposure = more sales.\nOne potential downside to the product kitting and bundling process is the complexity it adds to your warehouse management, fulfillment center, and inventory and stock level management — but you can kit and bundle worry-free with Flxpoint.\nExample Bundled Product:\nWhy Kit & Bundle?\nThe benefits of kitting and bundling can be advantageous to both B2C and B2B businesses for various reasons, including:\n✓ Boost your average purchase order value\nRaise your average order value by bundling relevant single product items into a kit or offering bulk deals leading to larger sales.\n✓ Encourage potential customers to try new products\nSell more by bundling popular products together and create unique product offerings on your website.\n✓ Stand out on marketplaces\nBuild thoughtful bundles consisting of complementary products to expand your product mix and stand out from the crowd.\n✓ Simplify your product marketing strategy\nMerge multiple product SKUs into a single SKU to combine various marketing campaigns into one.\n✓ Reduce shipping costs\nEnable customers to buy complementary items as a single unit with a product kit, rather than purchasing individual items, lowering both your shipping and fulfillment cost.\nHow Flxpoint Supports Kitting & Bundling\nKitting and bundling with Flxpoint allows you to sell bundles and individual products simultaneously.\nNever worry about not having the ability to fulfill a bundle order due to stockouts — Flxpoint automatically looks at the available quantity for each SKU and chooses the lowest quantity to determine the number of available bundles. This ensures all items of the bundle can be fulfilled.\nSimply create a bundle within Flxpoint using your current products and let the software do the work for you, allowing you to meet your inventory management goals and maximize your profits by not losing out on vital sales.\nTo create a bundle in Flxpoint:\n1. First, click “Create New Bundle” from the drop-down menu on your Virtual Variants page.\n2. Create a unique SKU number and title for your bundle.\n3. Choose your options and components.\n4. Review and approve your new product variants to create the bundle.\n5. Edit your product content (if desired), then build and publish your listing on your sales channel.\nWhen a customer places an order...\nWhen a customer places an order for a bundled variant, your purchase order will show the bundled items split into component SKUs (each single item).\nFlxpoint uses the lowest quantity to determine available inventory. For example, if you’re selling a camping bundle and have 10 tents available, but only two sleeping bags, you would have two bundles available for purchase.\nIt’s that easy. If you’re not convinced, check out the video at the top of the page for an in-depth look at Kitting and Bundling in the Flxpoint app.\nPlatform\nDistributed InventoryDistributed Order

on\nTwitter\nShare on\nEmail\nLast updated on May 17th, 2022 at 04:41 pm\nThe holidays are quickly approaching.Whether you’re ready or not, shoppers are curating their wish lists and preparing to uncover the best deals online.Black Friday and Cyber Monday are just around the corner, and retailers are double-checking their product listings to ensure their product information is optimized well for the holiday season.But what does an optimized product listing look like?What information are customers looking for?How can you help your products show up in search engine results?Last year, November ecommerce sales reached $100 billion for the first time.This year, that number could be even higher.Now is the time to make last-minute changes to your product listing strategy so that you can take advantage of these record-breaking numbers and see an increase in web traffic and cart conversions this holiday season.Tips for Optimizing Ecommerce Product Information for Better Listings\nPoint-blank: You can’t sell what your customers can’t find.Whether you’re building a product listing on your ecommerce store, Google marketplace, Amazon, or elsewhere, you must ensure your listings are optimized for search engine results and compel buyers to take action.Keep reading as we go over some product information fundamentals and best practices for creating an irresistible product catalog.Choose the Right Marketplaces and Platforms for Your Business\nWhile hundreds of thousands of ecommerce retailers sell products on Amazon, it doesn’t mean it’s right for everyone.Yes, Amazon is an ecommerce giant that provides online sellers with vast opportunities, but this comes with ferocious competition and high listing fees.Amazon is great, but the most successful businesses diversify their selling opportunities to niche marketplaces such as Etsy, NewEgg, Uncommon Goods, and others.These options have more seller-friendly policies, they’re less competitive, and they’re less focused on discounting.Selling on unique marketplaces can help you build a customer base without surrendering as much on your margins.Once you’ve decided which marketplaces make sense for your business, it’s time to do your research.Your listings should be as detailed as they are on your own website, but keep in mind that each platform has its own product listing requirements.Depending on the size of your catalog, optimizing listings per platform may require a lot of man-hours.If you’re selling on multiple platforms and marketplaces, you should consider a product information management platform that allows you to automate this workload.Experiment With Descriptive Product Titles\nRegardless of where you’re listing products, your titles should always be detailed.You can spend hours crafting the perfect product description, but people don’t always read them.They read the product title before deciding whether they’re interested in learning more.You must also consider search engine optimization.Be it Google, Amazon, Etsy, or something else, every platform has specific SEO and ranking principles.It’s your job to identify keywords, analyze what works best, and adjust your product information and titles accordingly.In some cases, short and sweet titles are your best bet.On other platforms, titles stuffed with long-tail keywords perform better.Figuring out what works best on your preferred platforms and for your brand is an art, so you’ll have to test your titles cleverly and see what generates the most interest.There are a few things you’ll always want to mention in the title:\nBrand\nModel\nOther vital information such as color, size, etc. \nYou’ll need to experiment with which piece of information goes first.And keep in mind that titles have character limits, so use your characters wisely.Finally, remember about half of all shoppers are on their mobile devices and viewing your titles from a smaller display.Provide Value Statements\nNext, don’t forget to provide valuable information in your product descriptions so that your customers can tell whether your product is the one they’re looking for.Your product information should be complete.Think about your product description as your sales pitch to your buyer—this is your one chance to get it right.They should find everything they’re looking for in your description and not have to look elsewhere.If the platform you’re using will allow, use bullet points in addition to a paragraph description to present your products.To ensure that your products are more discoverable on search, always include use cases and relevant keywords when applicable.Use High-Quality Photos and Other Rich Media\nWhile most marketplaces and platforms will limit the number of product images you can upload, you should always include as many as you can.Make sure the images you include are high-resolution lifestyle images in addition to use-case images.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"OqLhAvq7GdqtGWkjSR2gG9uY9Pwx3xKCEOl5rz+cakM="},"c7c0ba96-03e4-4951-8b60-2f22dab8d5dc":{"id_":"c7c0ba96-03e4-4951-8b60-2f22dab8d5dc","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/optimizing-ecommerce-product-information-holiday-sales/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"de83eb71-7923-4481-ba60-42f750446981","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/optimizing-ecommerce-product-information-holiday-sales/"},"hash":"ECRjITiw+pA6BKYEXNde5cRpimDuhznHuZCzKjHI/bY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e9162a9f-fb17-4d66-aee4-371b86ca7ea3","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/optimizing-ecommerce-product-information-holiday-sales/"},"hash":"OqLhAvq7GdqtGWkjSR2gG9uY9Pwx3xKCEOl5rz+cakM="}},"text":"Provide

product images you can upload, you should always include as many as you can.Make sure the images you include are high-resolution lifestyle images in addition to use-case images.Your main image should be the best photo and each secondary photo should show all angles and details of the product.If your platform allows you to include other rich media, definitely do that as well.Things like short videos and 360-degree photography help customers make informed decisions and reinforce your brand value.A customer is more likely to buy when you inspire confidence so they know exactly what they’re getting.Get Creative With Shipping Pricing and Bundles\nFree shipping has become a market standard.If possible, always include shipping in your product pricing to give the impression that you’re providing free shipping.However, if you’re struggling to get good shipping prices from your suppliers and manufacturers and your margin is smaller, this may be impossible.If this is the boat you find yourself in, experiment with kitting and bundling your products together with accessories.By bundling products, you’re able to spread your margin, giving you a larger percentage to work with.For example, if you sell tea, offer some filters, diffusers, distilled water, or other accessories that appeal to tea lovers.While the shipping will cost the same, you get a bigger profit.Optimizing Product Information: The Main Takeaways \nThis holiday season, avoid putting all of your eggs into one basket and try selling on multiple platforms instead.Just make sure you’re optimizing your product listings across channels so that you get your products in front of a bigger audience.The main takeaways here are:\nDiversify to platforms and marketplaces that best resonate with your brand \nExplore what works specifically on each marketplace and platform\nUse as many photographs and rich content as the platform allows\nContinually experiment with product titles and descriptions\nFind ways to reduce shipping costs and maximize your margins\nStrengthen Your Product Information and Listings With Flxpoint\nWhen you’re managing a catalog of thousands of products that you source from

streamline operations, and make customers happier.You’ll learn how to use social proof, efficiently manage inventory, and optimize order fulfillment.These tactics and tools will help you take your e-commerce business to the next level.Skyrocket Your Shopify Sales: Proven Strategies and Must-Have Apps\nIn today’s competitive e-commerce landscape, simply having a Shopify store is not enough to guarantee success.Sellers face unique challenges in optimizing their stores for conversions and average order value (AOV), two critical metrics that directly impact revenue growth and profitability.To thrive in an increasingly crowded online marketplace, you must leverage proven strategies and must-have apps to skyrocket your sales, improve customer lifetime value, and gain a competitive edge in your industry.Strategies for Boosting Sales on Shopify\nOne of the most effective ways to boost sales on Shopify is by implementing strategic promotions and discounts.Such as Buy One Get One Free (BOGO) deals, volume discounts, and free gifts.These tactics tap into the psychology of consumer behavior, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging customers to take action.By carefully planning and executing these promotions, you can drive sales, clear out inventory, and provide value to your customers, all while positively impacting your bottom line.A powerful strategy for increasing AOV is upselling and cross-selling.By recommending complementary or higher-value products, you can entice customers to spend more per transaction.For example, if a customer is purchasing a smartphone, you could suggest a protective case, screen protector, or extended warranty.Implementing product bundling, where related items are grouped together at a discounted price, is another effective way to drive sales and increase AOV.By making it easy for customers to purchase multiple items at once, you not only boost your revenue but also enhance the shopping experience by providing convenience and value.The success of your sales optimization efforts doesn’t solely rely on the tactics you employ; the quality of your product content plays a crucial role in driving conversions.Compelling product descriptions, high-quality images, and engaging videos can significantly impact your conversion rates.Ensure that your product pages are informative, visually appealing, and optimized for search engines.Use clear, concise language to highlight the key features and benefits of each product, and include multiple high-resolution images that showcase the item from various angles.Consider incorporating product videos to provide customers with a more immersive experience and help them visualize how the product can fit into their lives.By crafting comprehensive and persuasive product content, you can build trust with potential customers, address their concerns, and increase the likelihood of a sale.Must-Have Sales Apps for Shopify\nTo streamline your sales optimization efforts and take your Shopify store to the next level, consider integrating these must-have apps into your e-commerce strategy:\n1.ReConvert Upsell & Cross-Sell:\nThis powerful app enables you to create

continually monitor and adjust your approach based on performance metrics and customer feedback.By staying agile and adapting to the ever-changing e-commerce landscape, you can ensure long-term success and growth.Driving Quality Traffic: SEO Strategies and Top Apps for Shopify Success\nOptimizing your Shopify store for sales, driving quality traffic is crucial for long-term success.Search engine optimization (SEO) plays a critical role in attracting organic traffic, enabling potential customers to find your products and services through search engines like Google.By using effective SEO strategies and top-performing apps, you can greatly improve your store’s visibility, drive targeted traffic, and ultimately increase your sales.Driving Quality Traffic to Your Shopify Store\nTo drive quality traffic to your Shopify store, you must concentrate on both website optimization and external promotion tactics.While SEO is not the only factor in driving traffic, it is a crucial part of a comprehensive digital marketing strategy.On-page SEO involves optimizing your website’s content, structure, and HTML elements to make it more search engine-friendly.This includes doing thorough keyword research and strategically using relevant keywords in your product titles, descriptions, and meta tags, while ensuring that your site’s design is clear and easy to navigate.If you sell industrial equipment, you’ll want to target keywords like “heavy-duty machinery”, “industrial tools”, or “manufacturing equipment”.By strategically incorporating these keywords into your product names, item descriptions, and metadata, you can boost your store’s search engine rankings for these terms and drive more qualified traffic.Additionally, filtering keyword ideas by volume, intent, language, and difficulty levels can help you identify the most valuable opportunities to optimize your content for search engines.Off-page SEO, on the other hand, focuses on building high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites.Backlinks act as a vote of confidence, signaling to search engines that your site is valuable and trustworthy.To get valuable backlinks, consider creating compelling content that other websites will want to link to, such as informative blog posts, industry reports, or helpful resources.You could create a comprehensive guide on “How to Choose the Right Industrial Equipment for Your Business” and reach out to relevant industry websites or blogs to see if they are interested in linking to your content.By building a strong backlink profile from reputable sources that shows authority and relevance, you can elevate your store’s search ranking and attract more organic traffic.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"J+32A81aXStvrFcOTe79leZbN4li1c56sBfmtS7iIOU="},"d0fee3af-2a1f-4f1a-a67d-8e4fb923d6ef":{"id_":"d0fee3af-2a1f-4f1a-a67d-8e4fb923d6ef","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/advanced-shopify-integrations-apps-for-growth/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"3f6cbd3b-bdb4-4ce2-b3c7-0ce9c604da2b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/advanced-shopify-integrations-apps-for-growth/"},"hash":"y74uiXgZ936yJVmHhRTCt+2d426gUkuhr/IiZ2Hm8Us="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f524980a-a1cd-45b7-84c9-5f07a84f8bd0","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/advanced-shopify-integrations-apps-for-growth/"},"hash":"WeHnuQ7GxTphcc3JvynLOrBcGxnsYjF4X03W0y5T1uI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"41631acb-e1d5-42e2-b6b9-c119085253f3","metadata":{},"hash":"wzqOtRnIwjFpN8cp21LlRq0rdbeNuKVmUeoGolL/7Po="}},"text":"Additionally,

speed, mobile-friendliness, and user experience are crucial factors for SEO and conversions.With a significant portion of online traffic coming from mobile devices, it’s essential that your Shopify store is optimized for mobile users.This means having a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, fast loading times, and intuitive navigation.By ensuring a seamless browsing journey irrespective of the device, and improving mobile page speed and friendliness, you can enhance your search engine rankings and encourage visitors to stay on your site longer, increasing the chance of conversions.To optimize your site speed, consider compressing images, minimizing the use of third-party scripts, and using browser caching.According to Google, 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load, highlighting the importance of fast loading times for user experience and SEO.Tools like Google’s PageSpeed Insights can help you pinpoint optimization opportunities and provide recommendations to improve your site’s performance.Top Traffic and SEO Apps for Shopify\nTo streamline your SEO efforts and channel a steady influx of targeted visitors to your Shopify store, consider incorporating these top apps into your online business approach:\n1.Sherpas: Smart SEO: This powerful app offers automated SEO audits, personalized recommendations, and

well-designed loyalty program that rewards customers for their repeat purchases and ongoing engagement.By offering compelling incentives like points, exclusive discounts, or tiered benefits based on

optimizing your inventory processes and harnessing the capabilities of Shopify’s app ecosystem, you set the stage for streamlined operations and exceptional customer service.Optimizing Order Fulfillment: Must-Have Apps for Seamless Shopify Operations\nBuilding on the base of efficient inventory management, the next crucial step in optimizing your Shopify store’s operations is streamlining your order fulfillment process.Inefficient order management can lead to delayed shipments, increased operating costs, and ultimately, unhappy customers, all of which can negatively impact your brand’s reputation and profitability.By focusing on automation, batch processing, and real-time tracking, you can significantly improve your order fulfillment efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance the overall customer experience.Optimizing Order Processing and Fulfillment\nThe order fulfillment process involves several critical steps, from order routing to picking, packing, and shipping.To streamline this process, consider implementing automated workflows, batch order processing, and real-time order tracking.By automating order routing, you can ensure that orders are sent to the correct fulfillment center or warehouse based on factors like inventory availability and shipping destination.This not only reduces the risk of errors but also frees up your team’s time and resources.Consider this scenario: you have a customer in Texas who orders a product that’s in stock at your California warehouse.Without automated order routing, the order might get shipped from your Florida warehouse instead, leading to slower delivery and increased shipping expenses.By using an app like Flxpoint, you can create smart order routing rules to automatically direct the order to the nearest warehouse that has the item in stock.This enhances the customer experience while allowing you to streamline your shipping processes and costs.Batch processing is another powerful strategy for optimizing order fulfillment.By grouping similar orders together, you can significantly reduce the time and effort required for picking and packing.For example, if you have multiple orders for the same product, you can pick and pack them in a single batch, rather than handling each order individually.This approach can dramatically improve efficiency and minimize the likelihood of mistakes.Real-time tracking is also essential for streamlining order fulfillment.By providing visibility into the status of each order, you can proactively address any issues that may arise, such as delays or shipping errors.This not only improves customer satisfaction but also helps you identify areas for improvement in your fulfillment process.With live order monitoring, you can keep your customers informed every step of the way, reducing the number of “Where’s my order?”inquiries and building trust in your brand.Must-Have Order Management Apps for Shopify\nTo propel your order fulfillment process forward, it’s advisable

figured out.If not, we’ve got the presentation so we should be good there.Really, the quick background, so Nicholas and myself got together and want to talk more about this movement in drop shipping and distributor order management, and kind of how our solution helps this progression towards this new supply chain, approach to the supply chain really, and in this evolving retail world.And Eric is one of our mutual customers that is both on Flxpoint and using ShipHero, and he’s going to talk a little bit about his experience, how he has it configured, and really giving you an idea of what that looks like.So with that, we’ll see if we can get video figured out.And if not, I’ll go ahead and get jumped right into this presentation.Oh, there we go Nicholas.Who needs video?You’re right there.Nicholas:\nI apologize, that was one of my worst moments.Travis:\nSo yeah, myself like I mentioned, Travis, CEO of Flxpoint.We’re a distributor order management system.Nicholas, I’ll go ahead and let you kind of give a quick background.Nicholas:\nSure.I’m Nicholas, co-founder and troublemaker at ShipHero.Travis:\nAll right.I got the word we should be able to start video now.So let’s see if it allows us.No.Nicholas:\nNo.It says you can’t start your video because gingers are not allowed.No, it says because the host has stopped it, so whatever that is.I don’t know if I need to reload or whatever.Travis:\nZoom is pretty serious.Nicholas:\nYeah.Travis:\nForbid record is one of the options I have here.Nicholas:\nOh wow, okay.Yeah, I guess that makes sense.Travis:\nOkay, so either way there’s Nicholas.Eric, we’ll have to send out a picture of you to everyone.All right, I’ll go ahead and get jumped into the agenda.So we’re first going to talk really about the rise in distributors.I’m not going to talk too much about this, I’m not going to go into too much in-depth here, because if you’ve seen any of my webinars I do talk a lot about this.You can always go and search Flxpoint on YouTube and talk more about it, and learn more about it.But we will give a quick overview for those who aren’t familiar with distributor fulfillment and distributor order management.Travis:\nEric’s going to jump in and talk about his setup with ShipHero, and how he works with his customers using Flxpoint and ShipHero.And then I’m going to go into a quick demo, like we talked about, a tactical guide actually showing you the features and functionality within Flxpoint that helps you execute on distributed order management.I’ll kick it over to Nicholas there, and we’ll do a ShipHero kind of WMS, and fulfillment services overview, as well as a demo.And then we’ll jump into Q&A from there.So I’ll get started.Travis:\nSo really, we talk about distributor fulfillment and drop shipping becoming popular in this evolving retail landscape, it’s really because we’re in this era of eCommerce and Amazon that’s being accelerated now more than ever.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/DiZIprvGWXcVlvOORoox1RpOjWfCvMVn4Pm2GeixzY="},"1fce90b1-a2fe-4deb-a8ca-fec55cc0a464":{"id_":"1fce90b1-a2fe-4deb-a8ca-fec55cc0a464","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5a93bcec-79fe-43ec-8a79-261d5c4688e6","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"/DiZIprvGWXcVlvOORoox1RpOjWfCvMVn4Pm2GeixzY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4ac9eb7e-22ac-468c-ae45-25187d842219","metadata":{},"hash":"gS0ssXVxOAmsIlZ+SwPKXQlXD/yOZHe4z0GLEx3xKDQ="}},"text":"But

really because we’re in this era of eCommerce and Amazon that’s being accelerated now more than ever.Retailers are really being forced to significantly increase their digital catalog size, more products on their website, on their store, and then really supporting fast, often free shipping.So Amazon has really kind of pushed the bar there, set the bar and pushed the limits really on what you need to be able to do as a retailer to gain consumers on the internet.Travis:\nSo increasing catalog size is one, adding more products to your catalog online is tough to do, and also supporting peak fulfillment across the United States, or even internationally is even tougher to do.And then really, trying to bring on new, smaller trendy brands is definitely a trend we’re seeing, and increases a lot of the difficulties of just onboarding in general.So all of that, those macroeconomic forces have kind of led to distributed fulfillment, or distributed order management.And so what that means is traditionally in the supply chain, what we’ve seen for decades is a large department store, a large online retailer will send a large PO to their supplier, their warehouse of product, and they will get in that large PO of product in their own warehouse or their own brick and mortar store, and they’ll sell it online through their website or they’ll sell it through their brick and mortar store.Travis:\nSo it’s very infrequent orders, monthly, quarterly, whatever it might be.Large risk, large buying of product, and that’s what the original supply chain is set up to do.Distributor fulfillment is more along the lines of having inventory distributed as it sounds, across multiple warehouses.Whether it’s your own internal warehouse, whether it’s also located in your brick and mortar location, your third-party warehouse that you may have partnered with someone like a ShipHero, and are storing your inventory in a third-party warehouse because of international needs, or having another warehouse on the West Coast.Travis:\nAnd then even drop shipping, which is essentially buying the product after the consumer buys it on your website, buying it from your supplier after the fact, and then having them ship it out at one single order on your behalf.So all of those possibilities when it comes to fulfilling a single order, and trying to orchestrate that is kind of the complexity and the benefit of distributor fulfillment.You can kind of see how having the inventory in multiple different locations, as well was having quick access with low risk of inventory can benefit those trends I showed earlier, and those needs as we go more online.Travis:\nSo distributor fulfillment, much more difficult, much more complex, but a lot of upside when you can actually implement something like this.There’s three real main components of distributor fulfillment.Third-party logistics warehousing, so working with a company to warehouse your inventory in their warehouses.The drop shipping fulfillment model, where we saw empowering retailers to sell inventory that they don’t actually have to buy upfront and take on the inventory risk, or keep in their warehouse.And then the ship from the store, or the buy online, pick up in store approach, and more of that happening.So converting your brick and mortar to almost a little bit of a micro fulfillment warehouse to be able to ship those out.Travis:\nSo this really does empower retailers and brands with more efficient shipping allows brands to ship direct, versus having to sell through distributors and cut out margin.Even with the third-party side it allows brands to start drop shipping when they couldn’t have done it themselves because they don’t have the warehouse resources, or team, or capacity, whatever it might be.We talked about the inventory risk, and dropping that with the fulfillment model, but a lot of just benefits to implementing it, and it’s really across these three components that we see it being implemented.Travis:\nSo, there’s challenges with both sides.We’ll start with the retailer side.If the retailer is wanting to increase their catalog, or reduce shipping costs in time they look to distributor fulfillment to implement that to try to achieve these.But now they’re relying on suppliers to drop-ship across stock.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"V7r6IdTnfPfvTwDao/iuuwb7XKHpj6OEUCk+5CDihlQ="},"4ac9eb7e-22ac-468c-ae45-25187d842219":{"id_":"4ac9eb7e-22ac-468c-ae45-25187d842219","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1fce90b1-a2fe-4deb-a8ca-fec55cc0a464","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"pBOjmi983g2CAtfPvNCCJchnVn5W+cro7Osscwj9zmA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6685ea17-99c5-470d-90ec-3e1248ff0cc9","metadata":{},"hash":"DE5BBRZXhywIVNhwMSy8g2slGd+xgHDrbM57dr/x8E4="}},"text":"Travis:\nSo

implement that to try to achieve these.But now they’re relying on suppliers to drop-ship across stock.So a lot of that trust has to go into their suppliers.Not only just relying that they’re actually going to ship it, but can they trust the data, syncing and trusting the inventory quantities is a big piece of that.Travis:\nWhen an order comes in, how do you orchestrate that order between those four different locations I showed in that previous slide, of your own warehouse, your own brick and mortar store, a third-party warehouse, a drop shipper.How do you make sense of that and do it automatically on that scale?And then how do you pay for these POs as they come through?Very high volume, very different from the traditional side of things.Travis:\nAnd then from a brand side, they also face these, and Eric can talk a little bit more about this.But the retail partners are asking for drop ship, they’re asking for cross stocking, so how do you deliver on that?You have your own warehouse now, you’re one of those warehouses in the multi-node step of distributor fulfillment configuration, so how do you start accepting daily POs, both from drop shipping and cross stocking?Travis:\nCross stocking for those who aren’t familiar, it’s basically taking in a single order, consumer order from your retail partner, sending it actually to a retail warehouse, and then the retail warehouse sending it onto the end consumer’s residential address.Make sense for certain scenarios, similar to drop shipping in that way, that is it’s a little bit more of a complex order fulfillment challenge.Travis:\nPricing products and providing inventory.So you’re used to selling wholesale and getting these large POs.How do you start pricing, how do you manage the different pricing for wholesale orders, for drop ship orders?How do you provide inventory, managing that is very difficult.Shipping and branding shipping, and then just branded packing slips.So you now are shipping directly to the consumer’s address.You might not be used to that, you might’ve not started direct to consumer like a lot of brands are today.Travis:\nAnd not only that, even if you are direct to consumers, how do you brand the packing slips specifically for your retail partners?Because they’re going to want to appear like they came from the retailer, versus the actual supplier.Something called blind drop shipping, a big challenge to face.And then invoice payment returns management, same kind of thing.More high-volume, more transactions, a little bit more difficult to implement.Travis:\nSo with that Eric, I’m going to turn it over to you.I’ve kind of got your setup here, as far as how you use it.We want to look at the supplier’s perspective first, so Eric is a B to B, he’s a supplier product.And so Eric I’ll kind of just let you talk through how you’re using ShipHero today, how you’re using Flxpoint, and kind of just how it benefits your flow and how it gives you a competitive advantage?It will be kind of great to hear.Eric:\nSure, I’d love to explain that, Travis.Well we’re mainly finding with a lot of the dealers that are doing the drop shipping, as they were sending us things manually before, and that’s just not scalable.So we were getting all these orders via email, and they were always asking for tracking.So the tracking was not flowing to the dealers, because everything’s coming to us manually.They weren’t having the time to log in and do the high volume orders, they can’t log into our eCommerce website and search easily for tracking, so it was just basically a giant mess, giant cluster.Eric:\nSo we reached out to you for the Flxpoint setup, and it’s been a night and day difference.We’re able to integrate with all of our retail partners that we’re doing drop shipping for, and Flxpoint either integrates with their inventory source, or directly to their websites depending on the situation through the API.And we actually ship through ShipHero as well, so ShipHero is our complete WMS.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"g3XQrgnlaAGnmwC1K7dk9S0g+tVB8m72a2JvCqDsHuQ="},"6685ea17-99c5-470d-90ec-3e1248ff0cc9":{"id_":"6685ea17-99c5-470d-90ec-3e1248ff0cc9","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4ac9eb7e-22ac-468c-ae45-25187d842219","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"gS0ssXVxOAmsIlZ+SwPKXQlXD/yOZHe4z0GLEx3xKDQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cdb51695-cc44-4d58-9d97-5ed321e4ec3d","metadata":{},"hash":"unvr30GaBOWPdZxJHcxredPls42vSFzcsUYM1NAhCBo="}},"text":"Well

their websites depending on the situation through the API.And we actually ship through ShipHero as well, so ShipHero is our complete WMS.So when we ship in ShipHero, it’ll automatically route the tracking back from ShipHero to Flxpoint, which will push to our retailer.Eric:\nAnd that was one of the major pain points, pushing the tracking back.And we are able to do the branded packing slips, like you were speaking about.ShipHero, and Nicholas maybe you can speak to this, and I’ve seen you and meeting you right now, looks like our video finally went live here\nNicholas:\nYes, I’m sorry everybody that has to look at our faces, specifically mine.You guys are beautiful.Eric:\nWell this is my good side, right?So I’m not even sure if ShipHero is even designed for business to business.To me it seems like obviously it has a lot of features that we use for that.But maybe you can speak to that later in the call.But we actually use the warehouse’s feature, the My Warehouses is what we’re doing for the retailers that we drop ship.So we’re able to add basically a virtual warehouse essentially, which allows us to upload the dealer’s logo, the dealer’s address, the dealer’s support email, and the dealer’s phone number.Eric:\nAnd then every time we drop ship for a dealer, that’s a packing slip that gets printed out and we just throw it in the box, and it doesn’t have the dealer’s cost or anything on it.It’s just got the quantity and the SKU.If I was a retail customer receiving a shipment from the ShipHero packing list, packing slip, I would have no idea that it was actually a drop ship.It’s probably next to impossible for them to figure it out.And that’s what our retailers want.Eric:\nBut Flxpoint has been absolutely key with keeping track of the orders as well, that have been coming to us, in addition to pushing the tracking back once it’s fulfilled.So the dealers are sending us these orders through their own Flxpoint, or through inventory source, or from some other way and we’re able to easily manage all those orders, and search, and now able to push that also, into ShipHero too.And that integration is just a seamless integration for us, and allows us to scale.Eric:\nWe’ve seen drop ships increase significantly in our industry, specifically.When you go from a pandemic riots to defunding police, you tend to get a lot of orders in ShipHero, and Flxpoint have allowed us to essentially quadruple our volume with minimal staff increases, in just a matter of two or three months.And I mean, without Flxpoint and ShipHero, there’d be absolutely no way we could even come close to quadrupling our revenue in just that short amount of time.Travis:\nI appreciate that Eric, and I know you guys faced different demands recently, right?You’ve always kind of had people coming through the inventory resource app, and placing orders right into Flxpoint.But recently you’re getting requests for those to just manually have a checkout, so using the dealer portal.I know a big piece as you start working with larger retailers is being EDI compliant, and the ability to just give them an EDI file, things like that.I appreciate you kind of talking about that, because that’s what it’s really about, right?Being able to scale, and not have to hire heads and throw bodies at it as you grow in order volume.Eric:\nExactly.And I mean the only thing I’d like to add too, is even the retailers that we’ve been partnered with, that have been using something like inventory source, like we’re starting to actually see those retailers hungry for more technology, and hungry for a better solution.I mean, I know that one of our main retailers that just recently switched from inventory source to Flxpoint, I know they ship through ShipStation, for example.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ihLTo/ld7G+JxoMpAKdIVqIsPpV3zM/1De/5rkBMIz8="},"cdb51695-cc44-4d58-9d97-5ed321e4ec3d":{"id_":"cdb51695-cc44-4d58-9d97-5ed321e4ec3d","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6685ea17-99c5-470d-90ec-3e1248ff0cc9","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"DE5BBRZXhywIVNhwMSy8g2slGd+xgHDrbM57dr/x8E4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6efcf130-c3ba-4c64-91d2-4aa8b80aea8d","metadata":{},"hash":"vU2at8JfgSrp/eoxGe7Yxsdah7MdBGAaITqH2Vcz6WQ="}},"text":"But

trying to figure out if something’s shipped or not, just by a one function cloud software, if you will.They should really be on something like ShipHero, honestly.So that’ll be in my next talk.Nicholas:\nI’ll pay you later for that one.Eric:\nSounds good.I’ll accept the kickbacks.I’m not going to turn down any kickbacks, I’ll give you that.But it’s not something a lot of companies know they need until they’re told about it, honestly.And once they’re told about it, you can very easily show them that this, like Travis was just saying, eliminates the headcount.Instead of throwing more money and throwing more people at it, why don’t you throw more technology at it?And that’s worked really well for us, and I recommend that to our dealers as well.So hopefully everyone that’s attending this webinar today can learn more about Flxpoint and ShipHero, and if it’s for their company, move forward with that.Travis:\nEric, I really appreciate that man.It’s really good to kind of hear how you have it set up, and how it’s working for you.Eric:\nYou’re welcome.Travis:\nCool, so jumping onto the next slide, that was really the supply side.So as we mentioned, Eric uses the multi warehousing capability, the virtual warehouse capability, ShipHero, and has multiple dealers sending in drop shipments to him.A big part of the retail side is sending those orders and deciding, do I send it to my ShipHero warehouse, my warehouse that’s using ShipHero?Do I send it to a drop ship supplier that might be using whatever technology?Do I send it directly to my brick and mortars?So just to kind of show the diagrams here on the retailer side, an order comes in from a consumer, if you’re an online retailer you know one thing that you need to be doing is delivering and syncing up inventory, specifically to any one of these channels.Travis:\nYou might be selling at a Shopify store, Magenta store.You might also be selling the same products on Amazon, or WalMart, whatever.So the one thing you need to be doing is definitely syncing across these multiple locations.So pulling from your internal warehouse, directly from ShipHero, combining that inventory with maybe the same product from your drop ship supplier, even maybe leveraging the ShipHero fulfillment network where you might have that store for an international purpose, or whatever it might be.Travis:\nSo the first part is really having that inventory synced, so you’re not selling things that are out of stock.Secondly, once you receive an actual order from Shopify, it’s now generating a purchase order, and traditionally a purchase order to your supplier, but it’s going to be that one specific drop ship purchase order.Sent directly from API or EPI, or EDI perspective to your supplier.Maybe it’s sent via email or CSV, whatever they require.We’re going to be placing orders directly into ShipHero for those that you decide make the most sense from a warehouse perspective.And even maybe using the multi-warehouse function to decide if it should go somewhere else.Travis:\nSo let’s see, timing wise I want to make sure we’re good.That’s really kind of the overview here.I really want to get into the demo lead, Nicholas, sometime here.So I’m going to jump right into the demo.But essentially, tracking invoices and going back as well, to really fully automate that whole side thing.The big part of the demo here, I’ll show you in a minute, is making these decisions and making sure to route the orders appropriately.Travis:\nAll right, so jumping right into Flxpoint real quick, I want to kind of show you, we have those warehouses on the left-hand side.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qRY5WrEbic7dol/klyBcgsz3CoqX8gkCVG7MB5I2D58="},"6efcf130-c3ba-4c64-91d2-4aa8b80aea8d":{"id_":"6efcf130-c3ba-4c64-91d2-4aa8b80aea8d","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cdb51695-cc44-4d58-9d97-5ed321e4ec3d","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"unvr30GaBOWPdZxJHcxredPls42vSFzcsUYM1NAhCBo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"338d68f4-3a22-4c03-b3b3-8426f604a50d","metadata":{},"hash":"24RSPIvTZIfO1ICnBN6OpcjNWmD+gMZaFxqyLQ+p+Bs="}},"text":"Maybe

big part of the demo here, I’ll show you in a minute, is making these decisions and making sure to route the orders appropriately.Travis:\nAll right, so jumping right into Flxpoint real quick, I want to kind of show you, we have those warehouses on the left-hand side.I want to show you really what it kind of looks like on the Flxpoint side, looking at the sources that you’re connected to.So I’m a retailer in this scenario, and I’ve got multiple warehouses that I’ve connected via ShipHero, as you can see, to pull inventory, to send purchase orders, to pull shipment tracking.I also have different customers here, I should say supplier partners that I drop ship from, and that I’ve connected via different means, whether it’s a file or some other method like an inventory source connection, whatever it might be.Travis:\nSo the big thing to kind of see here is not only do you have these connected in one way to pull inventory, but also you might need to send purchase orders a different way.It might not all be done via API, depending on who you’re working with.Some might be a file that gets pulled from inventory, but you send orders via API or EDI, so we have it configurable there and flexible enough that you’re able to connect.I’m not going to jump too much into this, but it’s all mapped in and easily set up, whether it’s from our team, or there’s a self-service way to integrate files.I’ll show you real quickly.Travis:\nThe ShipHero API, it’s all integrated, setup, turnkey.You just put in an API key, but for those that you are pulling files from, we’ve got CSV file integrations, easily kind of mapped in, mapping templates, imported stamps, different ways to connect very quickly with any of your drop ship suppliers that you might be working with.Manual upload is one option, but obviously you’re going to want to receive this automatically from your suppliers, so if they’re sending emails or putting it on an FTP location, whatever it might be, easily kind of setting that up, mapping in the files with a mapping template, and running the integration.Travis:\nReally, I know this is big in Eric’s space, running the integration as quickly as every five minutes.So pulling new inventory every five minutes, making sure when they have runs on a product, to get that up to your website as quickly as possible.But then definitely different options as well, on when you want to send POs and things like that, that can all be timed are pretty flexible to set.So you build that integration from Flxpoint, you’re pulling in that inventory, really what you’re getting from there, the net result is to pull in products.Travis:\nSo we’re going to pull in products with full product data when we do have the options to do that.We’re going to build them into a virtual catalog as well, kind of combining those products from multiple locations into one.I’ll show you kind of what that looks like.And the whole idea is that you’re building this one central, virtual catalog with multiple products, what we call source products.So that one product in your virtual catalog can be mapped to your ShipHero location, it can have a certain amount in stock there, it can be mapped to your drop ship suppliers, it can be mapped to your own internal warehouse.All that mapping is done automatically through our UPC and NPN kind of aggregator, what we call the virtual builder.Travis:\nAnd you can really kind of see here real quickly, just looking at one of these backpacks, that it’s one backpack, but I’m going to push to my Shopify store, my Ebay store, website, whatever it might be, with all it’s various structures in place.It’s linked really, to those two sources.As we saw earlier, those diagrams of the warehouses, so it not only exists in the US direct warehouse, but also source and supply.Your own ShipHero warehouse can be here as well, they’ve got different…","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7LjQDs/aIoC2kSbaU9X0GbGCX9FyNgE/czsLj3laAqU="},"338d68f4-3a22-4c03-b3b3-8426f604a50d":{"id_":"338d68f4-3a22-4c03-b3b3-8426f604a50d","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6efcf130-c3ba-4c64-91d2-4aa8b80aea8d","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"vU2at8JfgSrp/eoxGe7Yxsdah7MdBGAaITqH2Vcz6WQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cc773b30-c420-4dc1-8d7b-3ef9dfddb4f3","metadata":{},"hash":"pWhG4Jt+Nt8B6oVrWvJqfW9l52fQHM9c64OMbGu+Vmo="}},"text":"So

here as well, they’ve got different…in this case not so much, but different quantities, costs, things like that, that are all kind of aggregated, and managed in a virtual product kind of way.Travis:\nAnd so these are then easily listed to multiple channels, you’ve got different mapping templates to set pricing.Not going to go into it today, it’s kind of outside the scope of this demo, but that’s kind of how you get the products in, and how you get them pushed up, and mapped across.The big part of this really is kind of showing the orders, so when an order comes in and how that kind of relates to the distributor fulfillment, and drop shipping.It’s not as easy as a traditional order where you might fulfill yourself.Travis:\nYou’ve got an order here, and I’ll kind of walk you through what this looks like and I’ll show you what’s going on in the back-end.But essentially, we’ve got the two different SKUs here that have come in from my Shopify store, big commerce store.I’ve got a channel invoice.For the B to C side of things, it’s simply just a receipt.Whatever the shipping and the fees were, whatever they paid on the website, but in Eric’s case, you can actually leverage this to set different dealer groups to automatically invoice, depending on the dealer, a certain fee, a certain shipping cost, a certain item cost, whatever it might be.Travis:\nYou can dynamically generate this invoice, and have it be deferred, and paid in net terms.It really allows you for that B to B interaction, versus strictly a B to C where we’re just assuming everyone is checking out on a website.That’s not the case.For Eric, he’s receiving automatic inventory if I can go back to this real quick.He’s receiving automated orders from emails, and inventory source platforms, and different manual checkouts where that might be the case that they might want to get a quote on what was their cost, versus what another dealer’s cost is.Travis:\nSo that invoice comes into play from the B to B side of things much more, but if you receive B to C orders and it’s all checkout through your big commerce store, it’s all the same UI.It makes it really easy to run what we call a mixed model of both B to B and B to C.Travis:\nAnd so once you get that order in, you’ve invoiced them appropriately, you then now need to split this order into multiple purchase orders.You can see in this case, it’s going to two different suppliers at two different locations.One to U.S.Direct, one to Sports and Supply.Those are automatically sent, whether it’s via email, or over an API connection.You’re going to get tracking back on your fulfillment here, and lastly, you’re going to get sourced invoices back from your suppliers that have statuses, that have that actual cost of the item.So really, once you get that item cost back from a drop ship perspective, you know how much you sold under your big commerce store, you’re finally going to get a fully reconciled order here, knowing if this is profitable or not, which is a little bit easier said than done when it comes to drop shipping.Travis:\nA lot of times you have your own costs in your warehouse, you’ve got a cost from your drop shipper who won’t tell you how much that loaded cost with shipping and fees, and all of that is, until after you’ve ordered it.So getting that reconciled is definitely something we can help with, and integrate, and really automate just by connecting to the invoices.So that’s an order.What’s going on, the magic behind the scenes on all of that really, is kind of the routing size.So I’ve got three minutes and I’ll kick it over to Nicholas.Travis:\nBut to show you kind of what’s going on in the order side, let me jump to orders, we’ll go to routing.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Dk5fhePb87HMu0C9DtwZzGKraGN2OuPAscadubwVcsc="},"cc773b30-c420-4dc1-8d7b-3ef9dfddb4f3":{"id_":"cc773b30-c420-4dc1-8d7b-3ef9dfddb4f3","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"338d68f4-3a22-4c03-b3b3-8426f604a50d","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"24RSPIvTZIfO1ICnBN6OpcjNWmD+gMZaFxqyLQ+p+Bs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2c35b9c7-1f77-43f4-8f36-42020a9c90f3","metadata":{},"hash":"elpQ4omySh2rV0S4Z0RTOc2EsMUrA7ui0NDi6U8HuaU="}},"text":"Travis:\nA

side, let me jump to orders, we’ll go to routing.You can see there’s different rules you can set for putting orders on hold.You can only automate if you can take care of the edge cases as well, because if you try to automate everything and things don’t go according to plan, so if you take care of the edge cases like international orders, stopping orders over a certain amount, maybe even identifying California orders by tagging the items that are California restricted and looking for those on orders, to stop them before they’re automatically routed.Travis:\nAccounting for these edge cases allows you to truly, fully automate.And then when you do get to the point of automating those orders, you’ve got a couple different routing groups we can create, just to show for the default routing group, for the sake of the demo.When an order comes in from big commerce, you’re going to run through some routing priorities.So I’ve got my ShipHero warehouses over here, and in this case you can configure a couple different ways.We definitely recommend Flxpoint being that center control.Rules engine, because it factors in all these different…your drop ship suppliers, your ShipHero warehouses, so you can really configure it either way.Travis:\nYou can send to ShipHero, and ShipHero can have some rules down the line, downstream to make some decisions.Or, you can just really determine and route to a specific warehouse using our rules engine.It all depends on your setup.Typically, this is the ideal setup here, check out a route to the warehouse through ours.But really what we’re doing here is we’re first looking and saying this order with two items, try to get it to a single source.I’d rather do that first than anything.I’d prefer that, if that can happen great.If it can’t let’s keep moving on either way, but we’re going to prefer that versus require it.Travis:\nSo once it does say that, there’s two different options.I can send the whole item to my warehouse, the whole order with both items to my warehouse, or the whole order with both items to a drop ship supplier.Move onto the next rule.Lowest cost, what is the lowest cost item?That’s going to factor into the drop ship fee that you configured at a warehouse level, if you are charged drop ship fees.If you’re using rate shopping on our Flxpoint pro-plan, it’s going to factor in the actual real-time rates that we pull from UPS, FEDEX, DHL.And factor that in as well.Travis:\nAnd then lastly it’s going to factor in the item cost, which might vary, depending on if you’re going to pay less for a wholesale purchase that you made, and an item that you have in your own warehouse, versus a drop ship item.So that’s factoring in all three of those to determine lowest cost.If it’s not outside of a marginal amount of cost, they’re all about the same cost.It’s going to move onto preferred sources, which rank here.And I always want to ship from my warehouses first, and it’s going to factor in California versus New York here, because of the lowest cost.And then lastly it’s going to look for the shipping policies.Travis:\nSo all of that is kind of the behind the scenes that is making those two POs like I mentioned earlier, split and split appropriately.All the logic behind that is kind of the secret sauce of Flxpoint.And really in the drop ship world, and distributor order management world, that little bit of margin matters each time.Not only from a cost perspective, but also customer experience.If you can ship it to a closer warehouse, you can squeeze some margin out, and add some value to the product in general.It’s going to be better for you.And then lastly, you’ve got the cross stocking ability to override addresses and ship it to your own warehouse.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"uqvimSfZB2qds38MXuX4NUyQNOtw+ofSvJ/NFUwAXPI="},"2c35b9c7-1f77-43f4-8f36-42020a9c90f3":{"id_":"2c35b9c7-1f77-43f4-8f36-42020a9c90f3","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cc773b30-c420-4dc1-8d7b-3ef9dfddb4f3","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"pWhG4Jt+Nt8B6oVrWvJqfW9l52fQHM9c64OMbGu+Vmo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ec66af6d-bce2-48ea-8e25-0d657792744d","metadata":{},"hash":"GODKRPytmnbLV0ofZZNRG4++orJWlauQ8/+QgNreAaU="}},"text":"It’s

typically see in a high level, and how we work with ShipHero, and how you factor in your own warehouses that are on the ShipHero platform.With that, I’ll go ahead and work through these slides for you, if you prefer, Nicholas?Nicholas:\nYeah that works, that’s fine.All right, so hope everybody’s doing okay.It’s fascinating, I like all our different home setups.I imagine if we see other people’s videos we’d see some also home setups too.So I guess first off, I’ve learned a bunch of stuff, by the way lads, so thank you.I would say that there were a couple of things that came up, which we can actually answer and put into context of what we’re focusing on at ShipHero.And to put it into context, logistics and supply chain, and all other buzzwords and terms, it’s a very complicated and deep world.There are lots of different areas of specialization.Nicholas:\nSo for us, we made a conscious decision when we started out seven and a half years ago out of our own frustration with poor software, that we weren’t going to do everything.In fact, there’s a lot of things here that Flxpoint is doing that really work well with what we’re doing, because we simply don’t do it.So it’s awesome to have this system that can help us accomplish what we’re focusing on.So we believe that good software should be simply to use, and things can be complicated, but if you’re paying nerds like us money to provide software, one of the things that we should be solving is the complexity.Nicholas:\nSo some of the stuff that we were looking at, that Travis was just showing, I know of many large, more expensive platforms where that kind of thing involves consultants and lots of dollars being spent, as opposed to a user interface where you can just do it.And that’s how we think in terms of our platforms.Next slide, Travis.That’s weird saying next slide.Nicholas:\nSo the two things that we do, I should note, one is fulfillment as our own offering.This is really for customers, eCommerce brands.They could be just starting out, it’s a side hustle, or they want to outsource their shipping and fulfillment as a service, which is kind of a new thing that’s emerging, as opposed to trying to go down the 3PL route.So typically 3PLs, when you work with a 3PL, not all are like this, but it’s typically been a space where they require contracts, minimums.It’s kind of a black box, they’re not very responsive.They’re not natively technology companies, so that’s one of the things that we’ve been really focused on, is thinking eCommerce merchants first.Nicholas:\nSo that’s taking into account things like speed and accuracy, fulfilling lots of little orders is a very different challenge than taking truckloads of pallets into one side of the building, and out comes truckloads of pallets on the other side.And fulfillment should be an opportunity for actual customer happiness.What I mean by that, is the customer got what they ordered fast, they got the things that they actually ordered, and maybe there’s some special treatment.With a lot of these platforms and how you can actually automate between Flxpoint and ShipHero, you’re going to be able to automate things such as not only where the order is being shipped from, but how the order is handled as well.Maybe different packaging, or a different box.Nicholas:\nSo we have the two things, first off, the software.So our software is used by eCommerce companies to manage their own warehouses, and we also have 3PL software.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"s6zp8/EJrGFVx2+74wXCG/cnegecuruHKFgx/2EfMFs="},"ec66af6d-bce2-48ea-8e25-0d657792744d":{"id_":"ec66af6d-bce2-48ea-8e25-0d657792744d","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2c35b9c7-1f77-43f4-8f36-42020a9c90f3","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"elpQ4omySh2rV0S4Z0RTOc2EsMUrA7ui0NDi6U8HuaU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3f0d20f9-bb7f-4b72-a55d-b74ae4fd6e76","metadata":{},"hash":"/TDXgoCHhXmy4xrcoAnjdI/daJr2c4AlE9MAW4yYfBo="}},"text":"Nicholas:\nSo

software.So our software is used by eCommerce companies to manage their own warehouses, and we also have 3PL software.So one of the things that we set out to do, was to help 3PLs who are not natively technology companies, have awesome tech and be focused on eCommerce customers too.So we’re taking care of a lot, it’s comprehensive, but sort of overall, obviously syncing with the sales channels, and the input points of orders and inventory management.The automation, so talking about how one of the things that you mentioned earlier Eric, as far as ShipStation.So I think ShipStation, another company with the word ship in it, but there are so many of them.Nicholas:\nShipStation is an awesome piece of software.If you’re starting out and you’ve got some stuff and you just want to ship it out, and instead of going onto different websites and trying to figure out cheaper shipping labels you can just print out shipping labels.Obviously, once you start scaling, and I think what they’re all witnessing in various levels, real changes that have been going on over the past few months, due to people shopping from home, not being able to go to a store, you start to run into interesting problems once you start to deal with scale.Nicholas:\nSo one of the things that we’ve really focused on, is we have this laser focus on everything that’s happening in the warehouse.So you’ve got Flxpoint, that’s managing things across the network.And notes, and from disparate data sources, and then you’ve got really, from a software perspective, ShipHero is making sure that the software is streamlined, and really easy for the people that need to get their stuff done in the warehouse.One of the things that we say a lot, is the less thinking the better.So I know exactly where I’ve got to go, I know exactly what I’ve got to pick, I know exactly what I’ve got to put in the box.So we focus on that, part of that is figuring out the cheapest shipping options as well, so we do the cheapest label and all that stuff.Nicholas:\nAnd then finally, the fulfillment, which I mentioned earlier.So we launched a couple of years ago, the Marketplace.Shiphero.Com, and I say that not as a plug, but just to show how uncreative we are when it comes to naming.But it was the idea that there are eCommerce brands that are trying to outsource their fulfillment, they’re looking for 3PLs.Google 3PL and you will see some of the worst websites in the world.So we decided why don’t we just take…we have 160 3PLs using our software, why don’t we put them all in one place so you can search for them, what services they provide, the ratings, and all of that stuff.Nicholas:\nAnd what we found when we launched the site, was the majority of customers coming in were not big enough for a 3PL.So 3PLs typically require volume, at least a couple thousand orders a month, in order to be profitable.So when you are too small, you essentially have no solution.So we launched fulfillment, and a lot of what Travis has been talking about as far as distributed fulfillment models, we’ve really been focusing on that, and one of the reasons why we focused on the distributed model, was actually something that Travis was saying earlier on, and that is shipping.Nicholas:\nSo especially in the U.S., when you think about shipping zones and all of the complexity with that, and then you’re like we’ve got to figure out which warehouse to put things into, if you have multiple warehouses.So we’ve really focused specifically on the fulfillment service of doing a distributed model where we’re forecasting where our inventory needs to be, we’ve cross-stocked, we’ve put that inventory into the different locations.And the whole idea of it, is essentially to localize your products.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+X6rfjVPvm2avPaAb+BlV4ms1K1hzHom9RWp8+BfWQQ="},"3f0d20f9-bb7f-4b72-a55d-b74ae4fd6e76":{"id_":"3f0d20f9-bb7f-4b72-a55d-b74ae4fd6e76","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ec66af6d-bce2-48ea-8e25-0d657792744d","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"GODKRPytmnbLV0ofZZNRG4++orJWlauQ8/+QgNreAaU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"382058ee-31c2-45a2-887f-6b2a2e0556ef","metadata":{},"hash":"z7ifkxzd3HyVAYrwcr/zp2HenxVZ7vSEJj1/HSsCs4E="}},"text":"So

really focused specifically on the fulfillment service of doing a distributed model where we’re forecasting where our inventory needs to be, we’ve cross-stocked, we’ve put that inventory into the different locations.And the whole idea of it, is essentially to localize your products.So when you’re thinking about distributed inventory, it could be because you want to build resiliency, could be because you’re using different services.Nicholas:\nAnother reason, which I think is going to become more prevalent as time goes in, is being carbon conscious when it comes to how your packages are being shipped.So a big thing that you can do, is just not fly things to places.Planes are very carbon costly.I’ve been spending way too much time reading upon this stuff, as we’ve been launching a service.But yeah, that’s another thing to think about when it comes to a distributor fulfillment, is if you are building your own network, or spreading, you’re essentially load balancing across your network, you can actually model it, and Flxpoint does a really good job of this, you could really model it where you’re actually able to bring down the cost of shipping.Imagine that, so you’re not doing zone seven, eight, you’re sort of typically averaging zone four, zone five, which is fascinating.So that’s something that we were really focused on.Travis:\nAnd Nicholas, I wanted to bring up that marketing question, because one thing that we determined when we were talking last week, is we realize that having a ShipHero WMS in your own warehouse is a great, easy, quick connection, but you guys launching into marketplace allows you to now easily connect to any 3PL that is on the ShipHero platform.So we always get people to say do you recommend a 3PL to use?And now because we’ve built this integration, now we’ve gotten used to the 63 different warehouses that you connect to and can easily find here.So I thought that was helpful, because I wasn’t even sure about that when we initially talked, if that was the case, but it seems like it is and it definitely helps with that.If you want to go international, or if you just need a west coast location to decrease that carbon footprint, you’ve got it right there by a quick and easy integration.Nicholas:\nYeah, and I think this is the radical change that we’re seeing.So what we’ve seen over the past several years, is the emergence of SaaS products, but you still have the old school players that are in the space, they’ve been doing it for years, they have their lingo, they have their words.But many of us, we don’t have the comfort of saying we’re going to use this company, and what’s the integration?Let’s figure it out.It takes six months?Great, you just don’t have the time.So you need to be able to move fast, and in some cases it’s also an experiment.There is no done.We’re all trying to figure stuff out that’s flying at us, and we’ve got to be able to rapidly adapt to all the stuff that’s changing.Nicholas:\nSo to your point, we’ve seen a few merchants who have actually used our software, where they do no fulfillment themselves, but they’re using 3PLs that use our software, and they’re building their own fulfillment networks, which definitely when we started this seven years ago, I never imagined that, but it’s amazing where things go.So yeah, it’s a good point.Travis:\nDid you want me to make you the host?Are you able to share-\nNicholas:\nSure.Travis:\nLet me see where this should be.Let me know if it doesn’t allow you.Nicholas:\nLook at that ginger face.Let me see.All right, let me know if you can see that?Travis:\nLook at that, seamless technical transition.Look at that.Nicholas:\nWow, that’s amazing.The internet will break in three seconds.Okay, so yeah, I’ll give a brief overview.So what we’re looking at here is ShipHero SAS, so this is if you’re using software to run your own warehouse.So there’s two sides to our SAS product.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"A04phtgMhA8keyKdapMvnOsVIUThMAauADPX+vBFLG4="},"382058ee-31c2-45a2-887f-6b2a2e0556ef":{"id_":"382058ee-31c2-45a2-887f-6b2a2e0556ef","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3f0d20f9-bb7f-4b72-a55d-b74ae4fd6e76","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"/TDXgoCHhXmy4xrcoAnjdI/daJr2c4AlE9MAW4yYfBo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f5373015-56c1-4cf9-a7aa-8af376cacaec","metadata":{},"hash":"VyJ+0S6G3r/idiRZSks0UiCeesLpHbrpqstwvGbGecg="}},"text":"So

internet will break in three seconds.Okay, so yeah, I’ll give a brief overview.So what we’re looking at here is ShipHero SAS, so this is if you’re using software to run your own warehouse.So there’s two sides to our SAS product.You’ve got access to everything, so your probably an operations manager, or running the warehouse, you need to be able to connect carriers, configure carriers, configure your shipping, all of that stuff.When we were talking earlier about roles, so with ShipHero being so focused on eCommerce, things like B2B have not been our focus.Our focus is you’ve got orders coming into the system, how do they get prioritized, what are we figuring out in the shipping, and they better get picked and packed accurately, and they get out the door.Nicholas:\nThat is our focus, and we can do that in one warehouse or multiple warehouses.So really, when you’re thinking about how the systems work together, we haven’t tried to figure out everything that you guys over at Flxpoint have figured out.Precisely all these things that have happened in the warehouse, and that is enough.There’s so many things that you need to get right in a warehouse, especially when you’re doing volume.So, us trying to take on the world and solve everything else, and do it poorly was never a decision of ours.Nicholas:\nSo the idea here is that I’m in my dashboard.I could, for example, so we talk about the automation or routing that happens at different nodes.Once it gets into a node, you can then do automation within that node, so how the order is treated, prioritized, set a shipping method, send a message, flag an order if you’re detecting something wrong.So you can set those automation rules, but this interface here, is really for someone who’s managing everything.The interface, I’ll show you the warehouse allocation stuff in a minute.The interface that your pickers and packers are going to be seeing, is more like this.So it’s just laser focused.I see the orders, so this is the packing screen.I see my orders, I’m scanning a barcode, and I’m able to…let’s see if I can load one of these up.Nicholas:\nSo I would scan the barcode of the total that’s been picked into.Obviously, my test store has socks because I’m British, besides that Aster Martins.And I’m able to scan those items, it’s figured out, it’s going to Michael Cain, of course.It’s figured out the shipping label, and I’m just using a barcode scanner and I’m scanning an instruction to print the shipping label.That’s going to send that information back to the source store, in the case of it coming through Flxpoint, that’s going to go back to Flxpoint, Flxpoint is going to be communicating that.Nicholas:\nAnd then the final thing I’ll show before everybody falls into a deep coma, is what we call multi-warehouse allocation.So we’re not as fancy as you Travis, we don’t have fancy names, unfortunately.So the multi-warehouse allocation is simply you have multiple warehouses, how are you allocating orders to those warehouses?So me and Travis were talking about this the other day, we’re like there are some areas that both ShipHero and Flxpoint, they both do the same things.So obviously if you’re implementing both systems, one of the things to keep in mind, is the solutions team members on both of our teams are going to be very aware of the overall setup, and how best to utilize both systems for where you should have allocation rules, and routing rules.Nicholas:\nSo in the case of ShipHero, we have these multi-warehouse allocation rules specifically for our customers that they’re connected directly to the store, they’re doing some dynamic allocation between maybe they have two warehouses, or maybe they have their own warehouse and they’re using a warehouse that’s using ShipHero.It’s very ShipHero focused, and it’s very similar in terms of what Flxpoint allows you to do.We probably don’t have as many bells and whistles, but it’s the same sort of rules.You have your conditions, you have your actions, it’s figuring out which warehouse to go to.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1Ml3DO3yeWj++91PlmHx4TfwM5mxcv8pyWoD0aSTESE="},"f5373015-56c1-4cf9-a7aa-8af376cacaec":{"id_":"f5373015-56c1-4cf9-a7aa-8af376cacaec","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"382058ee-31c2-45a2-887f-6b2a2e0556ef","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"z7ifkxzd3HyVAYrwcr/zp2HenxVZ7vSEJj1/HSsCs4E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"58b22f30-4f85-42e5-b048-595dfdf89e23","metadata":{},"hash":"KrW9bXQyEMXfKSzyC7aYJPSZ6/bs+6jCUJqaIW4wBEg="}},"text":"So

your conditions, you have your actions, it’s figuring out which warehouse to go to.Nicholas:\nWith Flxpoint, when we were looking through this and saying if I’m looking at this as a solution, what is the difference?ShipHero is just about ShipHero.So Flxpoint is going way beyond that.So for example, ShipHero does not have a native EDI connector at this point.We have enough customers now with all the pandemic stuff that are demanding that we add EDI, but we don’t have a lot of the things that Flxpoint has outside of the world of ShipHero.So thinking about how the systems work together, you have drop shippers, suppliers, different nodes, different networks.You would use Flxpoint to essentially be the connector, and router, and the logic with what’s happening based on what order came in, or what inventory’s being managed, what store is connected.And ShipHero really is that laser focused, okay the order’s in, we’ve got to get it shipped.And I need to know in real-time when the item, or when the order has shipped and it’s being communicated back to the system as soon as it happens.And yeah, that’s it.Obviously I could talk for 16 more hours, but I’ll stop there.Travis:\nAppreciate it, thanks for kind of clarifying how the two systems set up, and really the big thing to takeaway from that is our team is familiar with ShipHero, ShipHero’s team is familiar with Flxpoint.Our teams will work together to get you guys setup, and there’s a lot of value in having a collaborative team like that, versus picking one solution, picking another solution, and then going from there.Nicholas:\nYeah, and we won’t take six months to do it either.We’re very straight.There’s so many things out there that are made so bloody complicated, and it doesn’t need to be.So the idea is sort of first off, understand the rules, understand infrastructure, where there could be potential opportunity in terms of additional nodes, and then it’s ultimately laying out the let’s create the automation rules and the routing rules, which don’t require coding.It’s kind of refreshing.Travis:\nFor sure.So we do have questions right now, we’ve got about nine minutes left if anyone has questions, feel free to just pop open the Q&A right there in Zoom.We’ll wait for them to come through.The one piece to hit on, that Nicholas you mentioned, we don’t plan on building a WMS.I don’t think ShipHero plans on building a logic engine, like [inaudible 00:51:21] managing system.So we really were excited through showing these two solutions together, how they are plug and play, and they really do focus on us kind of being that central hub, and that routing logic inventory management system, and then ShipHero really doubling down and being the best WMS that they can, as well as now even added value in the fulfillment side.So if I think there’s anything to take away from it, you’re kind of getting the best of both worlds, with a seamless integration, versus bloated ERP or something like that, where it does a little bit of everything, not so great, which we’ve seen traditionally.Nicholas:\nYeah.And I would say something else as well, so we’re noticing more companies that are cross border.I know that’s a whole topic to get into, which we won’t.But we have a lot of customers that are trying to figure out cross border, and thinking about international shipping.So we do see a trend where companies are obviously not going to just go into a different country, or different geographic region and go out and get real estate and set up a warehouse.So you’re going to see more of this play, where it’s like we see companies out there that are using these technologies, or will use these technologies.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"x5YmiSRofGR/UIcLk+zOxEBjnL8VjS7MTK9MnU7GcXI="},"58b22f30-4f85-42e5-b048-595dfdf89e23":{"id_":"58b22f30-4f85-42e5-b048-595dfdf89e23","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f5373015-56c1-4cf9-a7aa-8af376cacaec","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"VyJ+0S6G3r/idiRZSks0UiCeesLpHbrpqstwvGbGecg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9581dfff-325e-4c2b-ae77-f2f72812cce5","metadata":{},"hash":"Bl0pP2hjsuu+sPiQwGnHHOh+wAWx2kWpwZrH4vnQVwk="}},"text":"So

companies out there that are using these technologies, or will use these technologies.Nicholas:\nAnd what we can focus on, instead of thinking about integrations and building a stack, if say you’re a 3PL or an eCommerce company, you can just think about how can I utilize infrastructure that’s out there, this technology that’s really quick to implement, and just have it solving…we see it a lot on the international shipping side where it’s being used, and cross border is a lot more complicated.But we’re seeing customers that are trying to figure out international shipping in the U.S., thinking about Australia, or Australia thinking about Europe.So that’s another area where this system can really come into play.Travis:\nYeah, certainly.All right, we’ve got a couple questions coming through.So one of the first ones is will your platform support a marketplace that hosts multiple vendors?So certainly, that’s definitely the idea of distributed fulfillment, and having multiple vendors that can fulfill on a given order, or are just on your website.We see a lot of that today, where someone wants to build an Amazon type model where they don’t really actually warehouse much, they are basically just a marketplace.So Flxpoint would definitely handle that multi-vendor configuration.And then what we see a lot, is as you start gaining, like Amazon does, really, once you start getting data and understand what’s selling, unlike Amazon you can maybe work well with your partners and say I’d like to buy wholesale from you, versus white labeling or whatever it might be.But you can actually then say I’ve got this marketplace, it’s a quick, easy, cost effective, low risk way to get up and running.I’m gaining some traction, I’m gaining an audience, and now I see that I’ve got a lot of sales in clothing, or in shoes or whatever it might be.Travis:\nAnd then you can go to your vendors in those departments, and you can warehouse them, get more margin, probably get half of what it would cost to get dropped shipped, you can now get your own warehouse.So then that’s where you implement ShipHero.So we definitely do support that, that is part of kind of the Flxpoint standard configuration.For Nicholas, we’ve got one here from Marty.It says if I have my own store platform, how would I integrate marketplace products into it?So from two different people, it looks like similar kinds of questions, but how would I integrate marketplace products into it from their own store platform?Nicholas:\nYeah, there’s an open API, so I think Developer.Shiphero.Com, if you’re looking into what your integration options are with ShipHero.It’s graph QL, and it basically allows you to do everything around inventory orders.You can use routing, and there’s web hooks for when an order status, or an order ships, there’s web hooks that you can find off there as well.Travis:\nOkay, we’ve got another that just came through.So, would you set up everything for us on Flxpoint and ShipHero so that we just run the routine?So yes, this is actually a great question.I know on our side, we have recently rolled out professional services packages where our team, that’s all they do everyday, is help configure merchants with the drop ship capabilities on our Flxpoint platform, which is helping them integrate new drop shippers in general.They’re really just kind of being experts in that, and kind of do it for you type package.Nicholas I’ll let you speak to your guys’ services if you have them, around kind of a setup?Nicholas:\nYeah, so we typically charge a million dollars a day for setup.I’m kidding.And everybody leaves.Setup for us is just part of the process.I think it’s very important, and that’s how our teams work together.It’s very important to focus on making sure we understand what it is you’re trying to do.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"B/bhka1JQsr07LdZGETg4NVFeAWmvk4wMOPj5U1tbW4="},"9581dfff-325e-4c2b-ae77-f2f72812cce5":{"id_":"9581dfff-325e-4c2b-ae77-f2f72812cce5","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"58b22f30-4f85-42e5-b048-595dfdf89e23","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"KrW9bXQyEMXfKSzyC7aYJPSZ6/bs+6jCUJqaIW4wBEg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"45b82c3c-cee9-4844-8c6b-069ac3aed6ad","metadata":{},"hash":"a5XixB1pimeSD9z2q5E+16IRKS8ZjlhYpvzE8Kg8Tu4="}},"text":"So

maybe you’re on this webinar, and you’re trying to solve a problem.You could do that with Flxpoint, you could do that with another system that’s integrated with Flxpoint.It’s not necessarily, do you need ShipHero to do it.So we’re very mindful of making sure we’re a fit, just because no one wins when you’re trying to use something that doesn’t do the things that you need it to do.Travis:\nCertainly.Okay, so we can definitely share the presentation, we’ll be sending out an email with the recording to this.We will also send out, asking for steps on what it takes to get started.We’ve got two domains here, our two website URLs.So Flxpoint.Com/Contact, and then Shiphero.Com.Feel free if you’ve got specific questions to reach out there.We’ve got both our emails up, we can definitely help with any questions you have.I know I’m more than happy to take those emails to get you in touch with the right person.Nicholas as well, I don’t know if I just put his email up there?Nicholas:\nI can recommend good teas.Travis:\nSo yeah, if you have any good tea recommendations or requests, he’s got some for you.Nicholas:\nAnd I just want to add Travis, that I don’t want to put you on the spot or anything, but I feel pretty bad that Eric’s picture is not up here.People are going to have to stare at my ugly face.Travis:\nYou did put me on the spot.Eric:\nI’m just an example.Travis:\nHe’s here in spirit.You guys can shoot us emails, you can shoot Eric an email, I’m going to put his email in right now.And so if you have any questions, we’re good there.You mentioned currency.So we do have a currency, we support Canadian currency, Canadian dollars, things like that.We’re about up, but we can run over if anyone wants to attend past the four o’clock eastern.Nicholas:\nEmbarrassing questions are good as well.Travis:\nYeah, more embarrassing.Now we’re past-\nNicholas:\nNow we’re in after hours.Travis:\nNow we’re in the after hours.Yeah, exactly.We’ll grab that whiskey here in a second.Currency, do you guys have that come up at all?I know we do have the idea of setting yours in a certain currency.We don’t have the conversion yet today.Do you guys ever have to touch on currency at all, Nicholas?Nicholas:\nSo we’re essentially…yes, so we have different currencies.We’re only showing the numbers that come in on orders.We’re not an accounting platform, so we do things such as cost of goods, sales by SKU, dollars spent on shipping.But the currency is something that you set, but it’s not like I think the same as what you’re saying.We’re not doing any conversions.And as far as [inaudible 00:59:59] as well, so there is no French version.Unfortunately at this point, it’s American/English only, so even I get confused at times.Travis:\nSo Zs, no Ss.Nicholas:\nThey say things very weirdly.Travis:\nCool.So the last question we’ve got here as of right now, I’m new to ecommerce, been drop shipping a little bit on Shopify.Really at what order threshold should I adopt this software?So if you’re not warehousing anything, then obviously no need for WMS.From a Flxpoint perspective, we typically say, just internally

the currency is something that you set, but it’s not like I think the same as what you’re saying.We’re not doing any conversions.And as far as [inaudible 00:59:59] as well, so there is no French version.Unfortunately at this point, it’s American/English only, so even I get confused at times.Travis:\nSo Zs, no Ss.Nicholas:\nThey say things very weirdly.Travis:\nCool.So the last question we’ve got here as of right now, I’m new to ecommerce, been drop shipping a little bit on Shopify.Really at what order threshold should I adopt this software?So if you’re not warehousing anything, then obviously no need for WMS.From a Flxpoint perspective, we typically say, just internally if you’re not doing 100 orders a month, it might not make sense.With that said, if you are doing 50 or 60 orders a month, and it’s too much to handle, then there’s the possibility that you could use it.But it really starts adding a ton of value at 100 orders a month.We have customers doing tens of thousands of orders a month, and they get a ton of benefit out of the platform, obviously, in automating those orders.Travis:\nBut I would say don’t pay for anything you don’t need, until you get to the point where really, I think both our software platforms are all about helping you scale, and so when you get to that point, that’s when you’d really want to kind of reach out and get a demo, or whatever it might be.Nicholas:\nYeah, and I would add that ShipHero, it is really comprehensive.So there’s economies of scale, and also it’s not as cheap as ShipStation.So if you’re doing lower volumes, I’d say don’t consider ShipHero as your warehouse management system, if you’re doing typically under 50, 60 orders a day.Just because maybe at that scale, especially if you’re using Flxpoint, there’s a lot of stuff that you’re already figuring out, and automating, and again it can come down to the complexity of the orders, but you may not need the dynamic slotting, and all of the bells and whistles that our WMS provides.And we speak to customers, we speak to people that are trying to figure this out, and we’ll be very honest about it.So feel free to reach out, we can chat.Travis:\nAnd if you’re just starting, like Nicholas said, there’s great platforms like ShipStation.Inventory sources are our sister company, it’s really for the more S to B, just getting started.So inventory source plus ShipStation integration is probably more suitable if you’re in that low order volume.And as you scale, as you get up to these higher order volumes, looking at Flxpoint and Ship Hero kind of configuration, probably makes the most sense.Eric:\nI would just like to chime in too.You guys are correct.However, it really depends on what your goals are as a business owner, too.If you’ve got deep pocketbooks, and you’re hiring employees, and you’re throwing a bunch of money into marketing, if you can afford it, and you think you have the market, and you’re going to be able to get the revenue eventually, you can go for it and see.Because that’s going to give you the best chance of success, and there’s nothing wrong with just trying it out, and seeing if you can get there.And then going back to something less expensive, if it doesn’t pan out.Nicholas:\nAnd so I think the good point that you have there Eric, is if you have employees, so that’s really…We have regular conversations with people that come into this and say what’s your price?Why are you so different than Shipstation?And I always, as a founder of the company, and we’re building all this functionality, and we’re looking at these very expensive platforms, and we think we’re competitively priced.But it’s a good question, but I always had difficulty answering it.It was like I don’t know.The economics of building a team, and building a company.But I think to your point, definitely looking at how much you’re spending in terms of labor, and infrastructure, and sort of general operations.And then looking at these tools, and doing that analysis.And a good example is for 3PLs.Nicholas:\nSo we have a billing functionality software for 3PLs.So because everything is happening digitally, everything gets tracked, and you put fees to everything.That’s how 3PLs work.If you pick something, if you pack and ship, there are fees for that.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"UtrJkhF7/p4o9UBK6WlxwvPNR0Fy9YL6sInz8Nxb72c="},"f9a3bffa-8898-450e-b823-89534bd508df":{"id_":"f9a3bffa-8898-450e-b823-89534bd508df","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5d9423b6-ee6f-4281-9e30-ea88671eda0b","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"rllNykQtMlCm2Dxi0i9/5yF6FVx4Vc3Mi5KoTP0rEtA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"45b82c3c-cee9-4844-8c6b-069ac3aed6ad","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/webinar-shiphero/"},"hash":"a5XixB1pimeSD9z2q5E+16IRKS8ZjlhYpvzE8Kg8Tu4="}},"text":"Why

pick something, if you pack and ship, there are fees for that.One of the most time consuming things for 3PLs that we came across, was you had someone that had to figure out from spreadsheets, and all sorts of different data sources what the bill was going to be, what the invoice was going to be for each one of the customers every month, which we found very fascinating.So, by automating that, you have a person instead of being super slammed for two weeks of the month, now they’re super organized, the system is automated, they’ve got all the invoices out within a few hours, and now their focus is maybe they’re doing relationship management.Nicholas:\nBut you definitely have the ability to look at a cost model and say what am I spending?How much productivity do I have with my employees?If I need to grow, do I just keep adding more employees at the same rate, or can I grow without having to spend over here?That is a good point that you bring up, yeah.Travis:\nCertainly.Well, I appreciate everyone’s time today, for joining the webinar.It will be recorded and sent out if you want to share with any of your team members.Nicholas:\nDid you see that?The question that Jamie has.Sorry Travis.So tax, first off he shouted that, so it sounds more like a statement, and we all have to deal with it.So I know that in ShipHero again, we track all the information on the order that comes in, so it’s a line item, we’re tracking that.If you’re creating purchase orders or anything like that, you can add that information.And if it’s more of a statement, yeah tax, bloody hell.Travis:\nYeah, same here.We’re going to pull in the tax from the sales channel and pass it on through.And it can be converted through a rule at any point, if necessary, to pass it on to the WMS.Okay, great, we got tax in.Nicholas:\nYes!Travis:\nWe hit our goals.Well hey, thanks again Nicholas, Eric, I really appreciate it.Nicholas:\nYou’re welcome, thank you Travis.Travis:\nThis was great.We’ll send it out.And thanks again to everyone else, y’all have a great day.Nicholas:\nYeah, thank you everybody.Eric:\nThanks.Thanks for having me.Share on\nFacebook\nShare on\nLinkedIn\nShare on\nTwitter\nShare

Data\nAutomotive Aftermarket Sales and Marketing\nScaling your Auto Parts Business\nThe Auto Parts Dropshipping Market\nIn the world of ecommerce, Dropshipping is evolving at an incredible pace.It’s a model where retailers don’t need to stock inventory; instead, they partner with suppliers who directly ship products to customers.This model’s effectiveness becomes particularly evident in niche markets, such as auto parts.To succeed in the auto parts dropshipping industry, one must have a good understanding of automotive parts and not just of cars or other types of vehicles in the broad sense.Auto parts knowledge is crucial for curating a selection of in-demand parts that meet the specific needs of vehicle owners.It extends to cross-referencing multiple databases to guarantee a perfect match between the ordered part and the customer’s vehicle specifications.The global automotive ecommerce market is expected to reach a staggering $213.081 billion by 2029, and the U.S.market alone is projected to hit $182.482 billion by 2026.Several factors contribute to the immense market potential of auto parts dropshipping.The large and growing number of vehicles on the road: As of 2022, there are about 290.8 millions3 cars in the US market.The average car has roughly 30,000 parts, counting everything down to the nuts and bolts.All of these parts need to be regularly maintained and repaired, which creates a massive market for auto parts dropshippers.The high markup and margins on auto parts: Automotive experts suggest4 doubling the prices of car parts to achieve a profit margin of 50-55%, resulting in a net profit of 30-35%.However, it’s important to recognize that this pricing strategy tends to be more applicable for lower-cost items such as external accessories like windshield wipers, etc.\nIn the case of higher-priced products, like wheels, etc. the effectiveness of the pricing strategy lies in the regular margins which are better compared to other industries.The Players in the Auto Parts Dropshipping Ecosystem\nIn this dynamic ecosystem, various key players collaborate to leverage the immense opportunities within auto parts dropshipping.These players include aftermarket manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.Types of Manufacturers:\n1) OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer): Manufacturers who produce parts for specific car makes and models, meeting the car manufacturer’s standards.Example5 : Bosch supplying fuel injectors to BMW.2) Independent Aftermarket Manufacturer: These manufacturers produce auto parts and accessories that are not sourced from the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).Example: Dorman Products6\n3) Niche Auto Parts Manufacturer: These manufacturers create unique parts tailored to specific needs, like performance parts for car enthusiasts, offering specialized solutions to the market.E.g.Skunk2 Racing7\nTypes of Suppliers/distributors:\n1) OEM Suppliers: OEM suppliers are companies that provide specific components or sub-assemblies to the OEM manufacturer who are captive suppliers for Car makers.2) Aftermarket Suppliers/distributors: Offer Parts not made by OEMs, usually as replacements or upgrades.E.g.Turn14\n3) Refurbished auto parts suppliers/distributors: Offers alternative aftermarket, specialty salvage, and recycled automotive components, catering to the repair and enhancement of vehicles.E.g.LKQ corporation\n4) Specialty Suppliers/distributors: Focus on specific types of Parts, like performance parts, accessories, or certain vehicle systems (e.g., exhaust, suspension).E.g.Western Power Sports\nTypes of Retailers:\n1) Dropshipping Auto Parts Retailers: Retailers, whether on online marketplaces or their websites or on both, utilize Dropshipping to fulfill orders, streamlining the process and offering a wide range of auto parts to customers.2) OEM Parts Retailers: These retailers, often found in traditional dealerships associated with one brand, typically focus on selling solely that brand’s OEM parts, maintaining a specialized and exclusive product range.3) Specialty Auto Parts Retailers: These retailers focus on niche markets, such as performance parts, catering to specific car enthusiasts.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hRyliCxte0cBwJz9Br9BnXg+lDJf+C3EmcbaZ62ACeI="},"6bf4d710-3a02-482e-9e93-e73476150d7a":{"id_":"6bf4d710-3a02-482e-9e93-e73476150d7a","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-dropshipping-auto-parts-2024/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"33e39362-390e-4388-8655-647ec015f31e","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-dropshipping-auto-parts-2024/"},"hash":"EFj3e+BDR0TvlihP9C2lbWnlh4QZ2yX7xeo2dX742ys="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"11334ca3-5aab-477a-b725-7f4733c2dcdb","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-dropshipping-auto-parts-2024/"},"hash":"hRyliCxte0cBwJz9Br9BnXg+lDJf+C3EmcbaZ62ACeI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e337831c-d2a9-4098-89a5-8e68d7673b89","metadata":{},"hash":"lQktdlbVoqZraQKeikF3BsRvp4YPYVgDFQHe9kdg/1I="}},"text":"E.g.LKQ

specific car enthusiasts.Having understood the key players in the auto parts dropshipping ecosystem, let’s now delve into the types of auto parts available, specifically focusing on OEM and Independent Aftermarket parts.Auto Parts: OEM Parts vs. Aftermarket Automotive Parts\nOEM parts are like the precision tools of the automotive world, tailored to fit specific car makes and models.Their quality and reliability are top-notch, but this precision comes at a premium cost.Why the high cost?Well, it’s because OEMs allocate significant funds to R&D, manufacturing parts that uphold their rigorous quality benchmarks.This helps them offer warranties and build an esteemed brand image.Customers recognize this value, appreciating the assurance of compatibility and optimal performance that aligns with their vehicle’s specific engineering.On the other hand, Independent Aftermarket companies focus on creating versatile components that fit a range of vehicle makes and models, providing a cost-effective alternative to OEM parts.Without the same scale of investment in brand-specific R&D and without the added cost of maintaining a premium brand image, these manufacturers can offer quality parts at more competitive prices.They offer an adaptable solution for dropshippers and retailers who prioritize affordability alongside quality.Here’s why:\nWider Selection: Independent Aftermarket parts provide a broader inventory range, allowing dropshippers and retailers to cater to various customer needs without being tied to specific vehicle brands, which can significantly expand market reach.Higher Margins: With generally lower acquisition costs, Independent Aftermarket parts can offer better profit margins.This pricing flexibility can be leveraged for competitive pricing strategies in the ecommerce space.Faster Inventory Turnover: Due to their affordability and compatibility with multiple models, these parts often have a quicker turnover rate, ensuring retailers maintain a dynamic inventory with reduced holding costs.In-demand Aftermarket Auto Parts for Dropshipping\nTo find hot-selling aftermarket auto parts for dropshipping, delve into niche forums, such as enthusiast communities or automotive repair groups.Seek out user-generated content to identify trending products and read through discussions to gauge interest.Analyze keyword trends on search engines and e-commerce platforms to pinpoint popular items.Stay ahead of the curve by monitoring auto industry news and emerging technologies, offering your customers the latest innovations.For your convenience, here are some high-demand products to consider:\nElectronics Maintenance Performance Exterior Parts and Accessories\nCar charger Brake pads and rotors Air filters and

your target market.Shipping Details: Review the supplier’s shipping policies, including shipping times, methods, and costs.A reliable supplier should provide reasonable shipping options to meet

details.A) Creating Your Auto Parts Online Store with BigCommerce and Shopify\nWhen setting up your online auto parts store, choosing the right platform is pivotal.BigCommerce and Shopify are both

detailed view of how parts would look and fit in their vehicles.C) Leveraging Marketplaces: eBay Motors, Amazon Garage\nWhen it comes to expanding your auto parts business, both eBay Motors and Amazon Automotive offer distinct advantages and challenges.Amazon Automotive10: It’s important to note that Amazon Automotive primarily focuses on new auto parts and accessories11, making it suitable for accessories rather than replacement parts.This makes it an ideal platform for accessories rather than replacement parts.Amazon maintains strict approval requirements for auto parts sellers, ensuring quality and trust for customers.Additionally, Amazon mainly collaborates with OEMs to enhance the overall selection available to customers online.eBay Motors: Like Amazon, eBay is a marketplace platform where multiple sellers compete.eBay has a lower barrier of entry, making it more accessible for auto parts sellers.It introduced eBay Guaranteed Fit12, marked by a green “Fits” compatibility checkmark on select listings, aiding customers in determining if a part suits their specific vehicle.eBay Motors also boasts a robust fitment system and even offers opportunities for actual car sales.Online Auto Parts Store Product Data\nWith an immense inventory of auto parts for diverse vehicle models, maintaining precision in customer deliveries poses a significant challenge, especially for online vendors.Dependable, current product data and parts fitment are the backbone of auto parts e-commerce operations.However, without standardized data, it can be difficult to match parts to vehicles, track inventory levels, and provide accurate product information to customers.This can lead to errors, returns, and lost revenue.Therefore, to effectively tackle this challenge, it’s crucial to adopt and implement industry-recognized data standards—specifically, the ACES (Aftermarket Catalog Exchange Standard) and PIES (Product Information Exchange Standard).These standards are the key to streamlining online auto parts sales.Understanding ACES and PIES Data Standards\nACES data are used to identify the vehicle compatibility of aftermarket parts.This data includes information such as the year, make, model, bed, engine, and drivetrain of the vehicles that a particular part is compatible with.PIES data are used to describe the features and attributes of aftermarket parts.This data13 includes information such as the popularity of the part, its dimensions, country of origin, weight, brand, UPC, product number, price, materials, marketing content, interchanges, and warranty information.Both ACES and PIES data are available in electronic databases.The ACES Vehicle Configuration Database (VCdb) contains fitment data for vehicles going back as far as 1896.The ACES Parts Configuration Database (PCdb) contains Parts data.The PIES database contains information on over 20,000 product types and 25 categories.Leveraging Data Standards for Enhanced Auto Parts E-commerce\nYou can leverage powerful tools that offer ACES and PIES data via integrations, enhancing your auto parts business.These tools provide a comprehensive Year-Make-Model lookup tool compatible with various e-commerce platforms, essential features like VIN search, garage integration, and fitment verification, tailored to the aftermarket auto parts industry.Integrating with PIES data can also be used to improve SEO and create attractive listings that drive sales on non-marketplace channels.Automotive Aftermarket Sales and Marketing\nIn the fiercely competitive world of aftermarket automotive sales, understanding the significance of marketing and sales cannot be overstated.To excel in this niche, here’s how you can boost your game:\n1.Niche Market Specialization\nFocus on specialized auto parts to differentiate from competitors and cater to specific market segments.Develop expertise in emerging automotive niches, such as maintenance components or high-performance parts.2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"BoRf1zM62ANJ62MO3MIfq0O53Sqfy33Rz1Q1H8sOQCY="},"008b37dd-16be-4566-ab3f-582348bc65c5":{"id_":"008b37dd-16be-4566-ab3f-582348bc65c5","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-dropshipping-auto-parts-2024/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"33e39362-390e-4388-8655-647ec015f31e","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-dropshipping-auto-parts-2024/"},"hash":"EFj3e+BDR0TvlihP9C2lbWnlh4QZ2yX7xeo2dX742ys="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"155ae0b7-54c5-41b4-8acc-3c741e7f5aeb","metadata":{"url":"https://flxpoint.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-dropshipping-auto-parts-2024/"},"hash":"nMRWU1TVTIkJ4eJ/gYUKbxBMk7i8dvL4Pu32dcSB6a8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c1c3a8cb-3f6b-4838-9809-a01283c7c652","metadata":{},"hash":"y9O15K8hFN/ucDcsb6VSPE6TMpD6iRx5Q2KxhZfnYvE="}},"text":"Leveraging
