In this post, we share a real-life example of how data and analytics helped a customer reduce shipping costs and solve their problem of paying carriers on time.\\nThe first step in reducing shipping costs is to understand what influences the cost. Shipping costs are always determined by the same four characteristics: distance, density, shipment size, and speed. When a shipper has a clear picture of their four characteristics, they now have a way to understand their costs. This is when they can see that there are some profit leaks, most generally due to outdated rules and the use of the incorrect carrier on some lanes.\\nAnalytics Reveal Faulty Logic\\nAfter the data reveals profit leaks, how can shippers determine if they are spending too much in the first place? The answer is analytics. Analytics makes the data actionable. Analytics exposes the number of excuses or justification statements a shipper uses when explaining their shipping rules. Statements like “I have to use this carrier because they’re the only one that knows how to haul in this lane correctly” or “I’ve tried other carriers and they just didn’t get it right” oftentimes reflect rules that were put in place many years ago. As these excuses pass down from person to person without question, the faulty logic persists.\\nAnalytics Untangles Tactical Problems\\nMany times, a company will become a customer of RateLinx because there is a tactical problem they can’t solve. For example, one of our customers was having an issue paying their carriers on time. To the customer, it appeared that they had hundreds of problems that were preventing them from paying freight bills. Sometimes, the dollar amount on the invoice for a given carrier would match their contracted rate and other times not. Sometimes they would get invoices from a carrier and their system didn’t have a rate for the carrier. With all these seemingly unrelated variables, they didn’t know where to begin to solve the problems.\\nIn this situation, we started with PayLinx Intelligent Invoice Management (IIM). This is how we were able to quickly and easily diagnose the issue. We contacted the carriers and had the freight invoice (EDI 210) transmitted to IIM. IIM then standardized and cleansed the data, and transmitted a clean freight invoice (EDI 210) back to the customer for payment. We receive the data needed to diagnose the problem, with no internal IT resources needed from the customer. Once the data was flowing, we turned on analytics, enabling collaboration with the customer and the carrier for a solution.\\nDefine the Problem Correctly, then Solve\\nTo find the correct solution, you must first define the problem correctly. We wrote about the consequences of solving the wrong problem here. Through analytics, we found three problems to address:\\nMiles calculated incorrectly by the carrier,\\nTender passed to the carrier was incomplete, and\\nOut-of-date addresses used by both the carrier and shipper.\\nOnce we understood the root cause of the problems, we developed and deployed strategies to solve them.\\nThe first issue was solved by talking to the carriers and tell them the exact setting they had wrong on their mileage calculation.\\nSecond, the solution was to update the tender record (EDI 204) that was being transmitted from the TMS to the carrier so it had complete instructions for the given shipment.\\nThe solution to the third issue was to have the master data in the TMS, and the carrier’s system updated with the right addresses.\\nAnalytics Reveals Unknown Problems too\\nWith the analytics turned on, we also found a fourth issue that the customer didn’t know they had: incorrect routings. There were certain customer locations that were using an outdated routing guide for some lanes. By having all the locations use the latest routing guide, the customer prevented freight invoices from entering their system that did not have a rate which meant they were able to leverage the right carrier with a lower cost.\\nOverall, the solution saved the customer about 5% on freight costs with zero internal IT resources required. Now the company has standardized and cleansed data they can leverage to diagnose the next issue, develop a strategy, and deploy it for the next round of freight savings.\\nWe hope you enjoy this series: Solving Logistics Problems with Data.

As a logistics and supply chain professional, you know the importance of data collection. Now you have it, but what to do with it?\\nSHARE\\nBy RateLinx\\nData is king, and if you are a logistics and supply chain professional, you understand the importance of clean, accurate data. You’ve told your leaders you need better insights to more effectively run your business. And you advocated for resources to help you collect big data, or sought outside help to pull it together. The good news is—you now have more data than you can handle! The bad news is—you now have more than you can handle. Now that you have all this logistics data, how do you leverage it?\\nStep 1: Define The Goal.\\nOne of my favorite supply chain management and business book, “The Goal,” by Eliyahu M. Goldratt. It’s an allegory about a man whose manufacturing plant is struggling, and he has so many problems he doesn’t know where to start. While many people praise this book for inventing the Theory of Constraints, it also addresses the best four words any leader can ask—“What is The Goal?”\\n“Data can tell you nearly anything you want to hear. The challenge is to let it drive your decision, and be careful not to use it to justify a decision.”\\nAs a logistics professional, what is your goal? Are you trying to reduce freight costs? Improve speed? Improve reliable deliveries to your customers? And how does your goal support your company’s broader goal? The goal will tell you where to start: analyzing freight spend by mode, evaluating transit times, or investigating track-and-trace delivery times.\\nStep 2: Trust the data, then the experience—in that order.\\nData can tell you nearly anything you want to hear. The challenge is to let it drive your decision, and be careful not to use it to justify a decision.\\nFirst, your analysis will highlight interesting insights, sometimes the opposite of what you expect. Second, use your experience to understand why those results are occurring. Is your parcel spend higher than you expected? It may be your system is not optimized for the right mode of transport. Or it may be a process issue resulting in a need to expedite late shipments to customers. The worst answer to why these results are occurring is: “Oh, it’s probably an issue with the data.” A data-first approach helps you uncover hard truths in your logistics business.\\nYou may also be interested in…\\nRetailers Improve Supply Chain By Integrating Data Streams\\nSolving Logistics Problems with Data Series: How to Reduce Shipping Costs\\nBut how do you know if it is a data quality issue, where your data is not as clean as you assumed? Again, the data will tell you. Did your monthly freight spend come in higher than you expected, yet your analysis shows you have more invoices than delivery statuses? The issue may be your budget, not your actuals. On the other hand, if you’re receiving high compliance charges from your customer for late deliveries and your carrier data says you delivered on-time, there are definite gaps in one (or both) sources that need addressing.\\nStep 3: Take Action.\\nSome of the best data analysts and logistics analysts see the patterns and know where the issues are but don’t have the authority or support to take action to make the necessary improvements. There is no success if you know The Goal, identify the hard truths, and yet don’t take action to improve your business results. Share a summary of your data findings with your leaders. Be sure to include your recommendations on how to solve the problem to better deliver on The Goal. You may also need help from upstream or downstream partners in the supply chain, so present those requests in a way that will show how they may also benefit from these actions.\\nAfter all, clean, timely, and accurate data doesn’t only benefit logistics professionals; it helps finance, warehousing—and your customers, too.\\nRateLinx\\nA leading supply chain software and data services company with the only integrated Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) technology platform.

PACKING AND PACKAGING\\nDiagnostic solution for packaging systems: Schneider Packaging Equipment Co., a packaging solutions manufacturer, has introduced Intelligent Illumination, an end-of-line packaging system designed to change the way operators maintain their machines.\\nThe concept is simple: Blue light is good, red is bad. But this basic spectrum could save manufacturers thousands of hours in wasted productivity, the company says.\\nIntelligent Illumination alerts end-user personnel on the floor of issues, then allows them to pinpoint and fix the problem(s) without even consulting the human machine interface.\\nThe machine detects when attention is needed and immediately causes the LEDs at that specific location to illuminate in a particular color. This alerts the operator to the machine’s condition.\\nIf the machine is running smoothly and requires no immediate attention, the LED lighting will glow with a soothing blue. In the event operator intervention is required, the LED lighting will switch from blue to amber, red, or other colors, depending on the action needed.\\nOnce the operator has opened the guard door where the problem exists, the lighting within the machine turns to white task lighting, which provides proper visibility for the operator. (Schneider Packaging Equipment Co. Inc., www.schneiderpackaging.com)\\nLithium-ion battery packaging: Labelmaster, a company specializing in dangerous goods transport, and Procyon-Alpha Squared, a technology provider focused on aerospace applications, have teamed up to develop and manufacture Obexion, a complete line of protective packaging solutions engineered specifically for shipping and storing lithium batteries and devices that contain them. According to Labelmaster, this new brand of packaging uses passive technology to achieve capabilities ranging from fire resistance to thermal, flame, and gas management to full ballistic and pressure management that will mitigate risks by reducing the potential for thermal runaways.\\nThis packaging is available in multiple formats: a multi-use metal design for larger-sized batteries and large quantities of batteries, and a lightweight fiberboard box for single-use and reverse logistics needs.\\nTo facilitate assembly and reduce shipping costs, the Obexion line of packaging does not contain heavy inner packing components, such as gel-packs or heavy liners, and does not contain additional pellets, other voluminous fill items, or outer packaging. (Labelmaster, www.labelmaster.com/obexion)\\nPackaging robot: Bagging systems specialist Automated Packaging Systems has partnered with robotics manufacturer ABB to integrate the Autobag 500 bagging system with ABB’s YuMi robot. According to the company, YuMi is the first collaborative dualarmed robot designed to work side by side with humans.\\nThe YuMi can assist with assembling and packaging small parts and kits on the Autobag 500. Using motion control and camera-based parts location, the YuMi can pick and place products into pre-opened bags, which are then automatically sealed and dispensed by the Autobag 500.\\nYuMi has two magnesium arms that flex on seven axes to mimic human movements with spatial efficiency. The robot takes up no more space than a human operator does and is extremely precise, with 0.02 mm accuracy and speeds of 59 inches per second. This robot includes built-in sensors that instantly halt all motion if the unit bumps into a person or other object, which eliminates the need for cages and safety zones. There are no pinch points on the YuMi robot.\\nThe Autobag 500 bagger is an automatic filling and sealing machine capable of cycling at rates of up to 100 bags per minute. Genuine Autobag pre-opened bags-on-a-roll are available in a wide range of sizes and styles that are system-matched for optimum performance. (Automated Packaging Systems, www.autobag.com)\\nWood-fiber packaging material: BillerudKorsnäs, a maker of paperboard and packaging technologies, has introduced BillerudKorsnäs White, a packaging material designed to help companies achieve greater visual and tactile appeal while using less packaging material.\\nBillerudKorsnäs White is made of primary wood fibers that are engineered to make the cartonboard exceptionally strong. The company explains that the product’s construction and mix of Nordic spruce and pine fibers differ from other boards available in North America.\\nThe company also offers consultation and sustainable design ideas through its Carton Solutions team. The design team provides pre-studies, prototype development, and evaluations, and can help brand owners create special shapes, latticework designs, windows, and other unique designs. (BillerudKorsnäs, www.billerudkorsnas.com)\\nBox-making machine: In response to the needs of retailers that ship e-commerce orders from brick-and-mortar stores, Packsize has introduced the iQ3 on-demand packaging machine. This next-generation custom box-making machine occupies only 62 square feet of space, including the z-Fold corrugated bale(s) from which the boxes are made.\\nThe portable iQ3 offers flexibility and speed, allowing 250 to 500 cartons to be shipped a day, the company says. Options include an onboard air compressor to eliminate the need for air drop connections as well as the GL3, an operator-friendly box-sealing device. (Packsize, www.packsize.com)\\nEdge wrapping: Orbis Corp., a manufacturer of reusable packaging, has added edge wrapping to its ORBIShield capabilities. The company says this technology provides custom-designed protective dunnage that can be installed in handheld totes or bulk containers, protecting parts and components as they move through the automotive supply chain.\\nThe edge-wrapping technology uses a heated or nonheated application method to apply Class A material to the edge of plastic corrugated dunnage. In automotive supply chains, parts and components move quickly and often across long distances. Wrapped edges are designed to reduce snags, punctures, and scrapes, and to help protect workers as they pack out parts or pull parts at the assembly line, while keeping operations running efficiently. (Orbis Corp., www.orbiscorporation.com)\\nCarton flow configurator: Unex Manufacturing Inc., a provider of order picking solutions, has introduced the Unex Configurator, a design tool that generates a 3-D image and bill of materials for users’ custom carton flow solutions. The online tool lets users configure a Span-Track solution from the ground up by themselves, accelerating the turnaround time for custom-fit material handling equipment.\\nUsers begin to create their designs with the Unex Configurator by entering the dimensions to match their existing racks, along with the name of the pallet rack beam manufacturer and type of upright needed. Next, they add the number of levels, types of rack, and end style. Users then simply click on \\\"send me my design\\\" to receive their free 3-D image with a bill of materials included. Unex can generate a quote based on the design. Although the tool is currently limited to Span-Track systems, the company says it will add other products to the Configurator in the future.\\nUnex Span-Track is a carton flow solution for full-case and split-case (each) order picking. According to the company, Span-Track also easily drops into existing structures and creates a carton flow rack roller system, keeping product at the pick point for the worker. Unex says Span-Track increases throughput by up to 150 percent when compared with order picking from pallets. (Unex Manufacturing Inc., www.unex.com)\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nTrailer heating unit: Engineered to protect temperature-sensitive products transported by trailer or rail through subfreezing ambient conditions, Carrier Transicold’s Solara heating unit features the APX control system, providing improved functionality, the company says.\\nUsing a Z482 two-cylinder diesel engine, compliant with the Environmental Protection Agency’s Tier 4 standard, the Solara unit can generate 50,000 BTU/hour of heating at 0 degrees Fahrenheit ambient to protect against the freezing of sensitive commodities such as produce, beverages, flowers, plants, paints and chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\\nThe APX controller has an easy-to-read, full-information dashboard-style display and is preloaded with Carrier Transicold’s programmable IntelliSet software to create heating parameters for different commodities. With the APX controller, the DataLink data recorder is now integral to the Solara unit, and a USB port makes for easy data downloading and uploading of information to the controller. Built-in diagnostics simplify service and troubleshooting for technicians.\\nOptions for the Solara unit include DataTrak software, which enables remote communications via telematics; flush-mount and surface-mount control panels, providing optional control placement on the outside or inside of the trailer; fuel-level sensors; an open-door indicator; and shutdown switches.\\nUsers can choose from fuel tank options that range from 30 gallons up to 120 gallons. (Carrier Transicold, www.transicold.carrier.com)\\nLithium-ion battery: Exide Technologies has launched its GNB LiFTForce LPX lithium-ion battery in the U.S. The company says the LiFTForce LPX can charge in just 15 minutes, up to eight times faster than a traditional lead-acid battery can, and provides increased cycle life and lower maintenance requirements for Class I, II, and III forklifts and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The battery is ideal for large distribution centers and companies that run heavy-duty or multiple shifts, the company says.\\nThe LiFTForce LPX was first introduced in Europe in 2013 under the brand name GNB Sonnenschein Lithium. According to the company, the overall benefits of the LiFTForce LPX are streamlined operations, reduced downtime, and lower total cost of ownership compared with traditional lead-acid batteries. (Exide Technologies, www.exide.com)\\nFreight service: Dayton Freight Lines Inc., a provider of regional less-than-truckload (LTL) transportation, has introduced Dayton Freight Truckload (DFT) in response to customers’ needs for a more efficient truckload solution. DFT now coordinates truckload transportation across North America. Paired with the company’s less-than-truckload and expedited service, DFT offers shippers multimodal service.\\nDayton Freight works with pre-certified, CSA-compliant carriers. In addition to on-time and intact deliveries, customers can expect same-day quotes and competitive pricing, the company says. (Dayton Freight, www.daytonfreight.com)\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nImport/export modeling: Logistix Solutions now offers simulation modeling, import/export tariff modeling, and sourcing optimization in its latest version of Logix, an on-demand supply chain optimization application. Logix enables logistics and supply chain professionals to model their operations to evaluate various distribution network strategies and sourcing alternatives.\\nWith a monthly subscription, Logix addresses the need for retail, food and beverage, manufacturing, and high-tech companies to handle complex supply chain and distribution problems that used to require ERP-class distribution network modeling tools, the company says. (Logistix Solutions, www.logistixsolutions.com)\\nEnhanced TMS: Manhattan Associates Inc. has updated its transportation management system (TMS) to help customers manage their transportation operations more efficiently in a capacity-constrained and increasingly regulated environment. The cloud-based solution focuses on enriching carrier collaboration and connectivity, and improving in-transit visibility, including management of temperature tracking requirements. Manhattan says its TMS 2018 also enhances driver safety and adds several user experience improvements.\\nThe combination of a driver shortage, decreased timelines, and increased regulations during a period of economic expansion and increased volume is stressing transportation industry resources. Manhattan has partnered with FreightRover, a digital freight marketplace, to give shippers the ability to find capacity matches for their specific freight needs. Manhattan TMS users can now utilize FreightRover’s Digital Freight Matching platform to locate and contract with dependable, cost-effective alternative carriers; reduce turndown rates; track freight; and expedite payment.\\nManhattan has also improved its TMS Mobile application to increase carrier collaboration, connectivity, and visibility.

(Signode, www.signode.com)\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nInbound freight program: Transportation management software provider Kuebix has introduced SupplierMax, a comprehensive program designed to increase the efficiency of inbound freight operations. According to Kuebix, inbound freight management has been an often-overlooked area in the supply chain because inbound shipping is complex, and many companies lack the internal resources and technology to put a comprehensive inbound strategy in place. SupplierMax leverages Kuebix’s technology and the Kuebix team of freight experts to implement an inbound freight management program that increases efficiency and reduces costs, the company says.\\nWith SupplierMax, companies can manage all or a portion of their inbound freight program. SupplierMax incorporates a series of comprehensive strategies to improve inbound operations. These strategies include building a plan with suppliers to reduce the number of inbound deliveries and associated costs by consolidating less-than-truckload shipments into full truckloads. (Kuebix, www.kuebix.com)\\nData intelligence platform: RateLinx, a company specializing in customized supply chain data services and consulting, has introduced its new Integrated Data Intelligence platform to help shippers extract supply chain insights from their multiple data sources. Using the company’s end-to-end DaaS (data as a service) approach from order through delivery, cash, and payment, RateLinx integrates data from multiple data streams in real time to create an integrated data foundation.\\nRateLinx integrates data from multiple sources, including supplier, forwarder, customs broker, third-party logistics service provider (3PL), carrier, and customer, into one integrated ecosystem. Applying RateLinx advanced analytics, customers then have access to a complete picture of what is happening in their supply chain at any time.

RateLinx, real life example on how data and analytics helped customer reduce shipping costs and pay carriers on time\\nSHARE\\nBy Shannon Vaillancourt\\nWelcome to our series on solving logistics problems with data.In this post, we share a real-life example of how data and analytics helped a customer reduce shipping costs and solve their problem of paying carriers on time.The first step in reducing shipping costs is to understand what influences the cost.Shipping costs are always determined by the same four characteristics: distance, density, shipment size, and speed.When a shipper has a clear picture of their four characteristics, they now have a way to understand their costs.This is when they can see that there are some profit leaks, most generally due to outdated rules and the use of the incorrect carrier on some lanes.Analytics Reveal Faulty Logic\\nAfter the data reveals profit leaks, how can shippers determine if they are spending too much in the first place?The answer is analytics.Analytics makes the data actionable.Analytics exposes the number of excuses or justification statements a shipper uses when explaining their shipping rules.Statements like “I have to use this carrier because they’re the only one that knows how to haul in this lane correctly” or “I’ve tried other carriers and they just didn’t get it right” oftentimes reflect rules that were put in place many years ago.As these excuses pass down from person to person without question, the faulty logic persists.Analytics Untangles Tactical Problems\\nMany times, a company will become a customer of RateLinx because there is a tactical problem they can’t solve.For example, one of our customers was having an issue paying their carriers on time.To the customer, it appeared that they had hundreds of problems that were preventing them from paying freight bills.Sometimes, the dollar amount on the invoice for a given carrier would match their contracted rate and other times not.Sometimes they would get invoices from a carrier and their system didn’t have a rate for the carrier.With all these seemingly unrelated variables, they didn’t know where to begin to solve the problems.In this situation, we started with PayLinx Intelligent Invoice Management (IIM).This is how we were able to quickly and easily diagnose the issue.We contacted the carriers and had the freight invoice (EDI 210) transmitted to IIM.IIM then standardized and cleansed the data, and transmitted a clean freight invoice (EDI 210) back to the customer for payment.We receive the data needed to diagnose the problem, with no internal IT resources needed from the customer.Once the data was flowing, we turned on analytics, enabling collaboration with the customer and the carrier for a solution.Define the Problem Correctly, then Solve\\nTo find the correct solution, you must first define the problem correctly.We wrote about the consequences of solving the wrong problem here.Through analytics, we found three problems to address:\\nMiles calculated incorrectly by the carrier,\\nTender passed to the carrier was incomplete, and\\nOut-of-date addresses used by both the carrier and shipper.Once we understood the root cause of the problems, we developed and deployed strategies to solve them.The first issue was solved by talking to the carriers and tell them the exact setting they had wrong on their mileage calculation.Second, the solution was to update the tender record (EDI 204) that was being transmitted from the TMS to the carrier so it had complete instructions for the given shipment.The solution to the third issue was to have the master data in the TMS, and the carrier’s system updated with the right addresses.Analytics Reveals Unknown Problems too\\nWith the analytics turned on, we also found a fourth issue that the customer didn’t know they had: incorrect routings.There were certain customer locations that were using an outdated routing guide for some lanes.By having all the locations use the latest routing guide, the customer prevented freight invoices from entering their system that did not have a rate which meant they were able to leverage the right carrier with a lower cost.Overall, the solution saved the customer about 5% on freight costs with zero internal IT resources required.Now the company has standardized and cleansed data they can leverage to diagnose the next issue, develop a strategy, and deploy it for the next round of freight savings.We hope you enjoy this series: Solving Logistics Problems with Data.A few weeks ago, we discussed solving noncompliance and business rules logistics problems with data, another common logistics problem we solve through our analytics.If you would like to have our blogs articles delivered

Logistics & Supply Chain Data\\nData is king.As a logistics and supply chain professional, you know the importance of data collection.Now you have it, but what to do with it?SHARE\\nBy RateLinx\\nData is king, and if you are a logistics and supply chain professional, you understand the importance of clean, accurate data.You’ve told your leaders you need better insights to more effectively run your business.And you advocated for resources to help you collect big data, or sought outside help to pull it together.The good news is—you now have more data than you can handle!The bad news is—you now have more than you can handle.Now that you have all this logistics data, how do you leverage it?Step 1: Define The Goal.One of my favorite supply chain management and business book, “The Goal,” by Eliyahu M.Goldratt.It’s an allegory about a man whose manufacturing plant is struggling, and he has so many problems he doesn’t know where to start.While many people praise this book for inventing the Theory of Constraints, it also addresses the best four words any leader can ask—“What is The Goal?”“Data can tell you nearly anything you want to hear.The challenge is to let it drive your decision, and be careful not to use it to justify a decision.”As a logistics professional, what is your goal?Are you trying to reduce freight costs?Improve speed?Improve reliable deliveries to your customers?And how does your goal support your company’s broader goal?The goal will tell you where to start: analyzing freight spend by mode, evaluating transit times, or investigating track-and-trace delivery times.Step 2: Trust the data, then the experience—in that order.Data can tell you nearly anything you want to hear.The challenge is to let it drive your decision, and be careful not to use it to justify a decision.First, your analysis will highlight interesting insights, sometimes the opposite of what you expect.Second, use your experience to understand why those results are occurring.Is your parcel spend higher than you expected?It may be your system is not optimized for the right mode of transport.Or it may be a process issue resulting in a need to expedite late shipments to customers.The worst answer to why these results are occurring is: “Oh, it’s probably an issue with the data.”A data-first approach helps you uncover hard truths in your logistics business.You may also be interested in…Retailers Improve Supply Chain By Integrating Data Streams\\nSolving Logistics Problems with Data Series: How to Reduce Shipping Costs\\nBut how do you know if it is a data quality issue, where your data is not as clean as you assumed?Again, the data will tell you.Did your monthly freight spend come in higher than you expected, yet your analysis shows you have more invoices than delivery statuses?The issue may be your budget, not your actuals.On the other hand, if you’re receiving high compliance charges from your customer for late deliveries and your carrier data says you delivered on-time, there are definite gaps in one (or both) sources that need addressing.Step 3: Take Action.Some of the best data analysts and logistics analysts see the patterns and know where the issues are but don’t have the authority or support to take action to make the necessary improvements.There is no success if you know The Goal, identify the hard truths, and yet don’t take action to

Library\\nShare\\nNEW LOGISTICS PRODUCTS & SERVICES\\nrollouts\\nEDITED BY DIANE RAND\\nSPOTLIGHT ON ….PACKING AND PACKAGING\\nDiagnostic solution for packaging systems: Schneider Packaging Equipment Co., a packaging solutions manufacturer, has introduced Intelligent Illumination, an end-of-line packaging system designed to change the way operators maintain their machines.The concept is simple: Blue light is good, red is bad.But this basic spectrum could save manufacturers thousands of hours in wasted productivity, the company says.Intelligent Illumination alerts end-user personnel on the floor of issues, then allows them to pinpoint and fix the problem(s) without even consulting the human machine interface.The machine detects when attention is needed and immediately causes the LEDs at that specific location to illuminate in a particular color.This alerts the operator to the machine’s condition.If the machine is running smoothly and requires no immediate attention, the LED lighting will glow with a soothing blue.In the event operator intervention is required, the LED lighting will switch from blue to amber, red, or other colors, depending on the action needed.Once the operator has opened the guard door where the problem exists, the lighting within the machine turns to white task lighting, which provides proper visibility for the operator.(Schneider Packaging Equipment Co.Inc., www.schneiderpackaging.com)\\nLithium-ion battery packaging: Labelmaster, a company specializing in dangerous goods transport, and Procyon-Alpha Squared, a technology provider focused on aerospace applications, have teamed up to develop and manufacture Obexion, a complete line of protective packaging solutions engineered specifically for shipping and storing lithium batteries and devices that contain them.According to Labelmaster, this new brand of packaging uses passive technology to achieve capabilities ranging from fire resistance to thermal, flame, and gas management to full ballistic and pressure management that will mitigate risks by reducing the potential for thermal runaways.This packaging is available in multiple formats: a multi-use metal design for larger-sized batteries and large quantities of batteries, and a lightweight fiberboard box for single-use and reverse logistics needs.To facilitate assembly and reduce shipping costs, the Obexion line of packaging does not contain heavy inner packing components, such as gel-packs or heavy liners, and does not contain additional pellets, other voluminous fill items, or outer packaging.(Labelmaster, www.labelmaster.com/obexion)\\nPackaging robot: Bagging systems specialist Automated Packaging Systems has partnered with robotics manufacturer ABB to integrate the Autobag 500 bagging system with ABB’s YuMi robot.According to the company, YuMi is the first collaborative dualarmed robot designed to work side by side with humans.The YuMi can assist with assembling and packaging small parts and kits on the Autobag 500.Using motion control and camera-based parts location, the YuMi can pick and place products into pre-opened bags, which are then automatically sealed and dispensed by the Autobag 500.YuMi has two magnesium arms that flex on seven axes to mimic human movements with spatial efficiency.The robot takes up no more space than a human operator does and is extremely precise, with 0.02 mm accuracy and speeds of 59 inches per second.This robot includes built-in sensors that instantly halt all motion if the unit bumps into a person or other object, which eliminates the need for cages and safety zones.There are no pinch points on the YuMi robot.The Autobag 500 bagger is an automatic filling and sealing machine capable of cycling at rates of up to 100 bags per minute.Genuine Autobag pre-opened bags-on-a-roll are available in a wide range of sizes and styles that are system-matched for optimum performance.(Automated Packaging Systems, www.autobag.com)\\nWood-fiber packaging material: BillerudKorsnäs, a maker of paperboard and packaging technologies, has introduced BillerudKorsnäs White, a packaging material designed to help
