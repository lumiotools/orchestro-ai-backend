Of course, it’s all fun and games until they get to the payment button and review the shipping costs.\\nIf your shipping costs are too high, 43% of shoppers will abandon their carts, according to a study conducted by Comscore. That’s too much revenue potential going down the drain. To avoid such pitfalls, you must find ways to reduce shipping costs to gain and retain e-shoppers in the hyper-competitive eCommerce space.\\nHere are six tips you can apply to save on shipping costs.\\nHow to Enhance Your Shipping Costs\\nWhile you can’t avoid eCommerce shipping costs altogether, you can cut back on your order delivery costs by following these tips:\\n1. Fit Your Items Into the Right-Sized Packages\\nUsing the right-sized packages has multiple benefits. Firstly, it reduces the cost and hassle of securing the product inside the box with cushioning material such as bubble wrap or styrofoam.\\nWhen an item fits precisely in the package box, you’ll use less filler material to cushion it from impact and restrict it from shuffling inside the box while in transit. This reduces your overall cost of packaging. You can use these cost savings to lower your shipping charges.\\nSecondly, right-sized packages keep the dimensional weight of your packages at a minimum. For instance, if you sell smartphones but package them in TV-sized boxes, the dimensional weight will be higher even when the weight of the product is lower. In that case, you would pay unnecessarily high shipping rates.\\nConversely, using the right-sized packages keeps your shipping charges at a fair minimum.\\n2. Reduce Package Weight as Much as You Can\\nThe heavier your packages are, the more shipping costs you or your customers will pay. Package weight is a significant price determinant, especially when you choose air freight because of weight limits. Because you can’t reduce the actual weight of your products, your only solution is to use lightweight packaging materials.\\nFortunately, there are many lightweight packaging materials to choose from, depending on the size and fragility of your items. These materials include:\\nWater-activated tape (WAT)\\nFoam inserts\\nCorrugated boxes\\nAstro foam\\nAluminum composite panel\\nBubble envelopes\\nEco-Range Boxes\\nWhen shipping heavy items such as gym equipment, you may want to disassemble them and place them in multiple packages for easier shipping. While that may not reduce your fulfillment costs, it’ll ease handling and reduce the chances of freight damage.\\n3. Calculate the Cost of Shipping Within Product Price\\nAccording to Convey, 36% of eCommerce businesses are concerned about shipping costs and the growing consumer expectations about low-cost shipping or free delivery. Today’s shoppers expect affordable shipping and will quickly exit your online store if you charge higher shipping rates.  \\nThis becomes a dilemma for ecommerce retailers. On the one hand, you can’t escape the rising shipping costs. On the other hand, you want to entice customers with free or low-cost shipping options and increase your Average Order Value (AOV) in the process. The best way to address this dilemma is by tweaking your pricing to include the shipping costs as part of the product price.\\nThis way, your customers won’t feel they are paying an extra premium for shipping. More importantly, it’ll allow you to capitalize on the decoy effect brought about by the psychological appeal of free shipping.\\n  4. Use a Flat-Rate Shipping Method Whenever You Can\\nFlat-rate shipping is an excellent shipping strategy you can use to standardize your order delivery costs. With flat-rate shipping, your shipping charges are determined solely by the size of your package, not the dimensional weight of the product you’re shipping. Additionally, flat-rate shipping saves you from peak season surcharges (PSS) that can eat into your profit margins when shipping during the holidays.\\nOverall, flat rate shipping shields you from the cost variations caused by changes in dimensional weight, peak season surcharges, and shipping distance. In turn, you can protect your online shoppers from unexpected shipping costs.\\n5. Compare Different Shipping Carrier Prices\\nWith the many shipping carriers operating today, you have the liberty to compare shipping rates and choose the most affordable ones. You can leverage shipping comparison sites or an online shipping calculator to compare carrier prices and get the best deal. With the most affordable shipping solutions, you’ll be better placed to pass down the cost benefits to your customers.\\n6. Keep Track of Inflation, Freight Costs, and Other Variables\\nLike any other economic activity, external factors affect shipping costs. These include:\\nCustoms and duties\\nTracking and insurance\\nHandling costs\\nEconomic factors such as inflation\\nSocial factors such as insecurity or political instability in delivery locations\\nYou must account for these and other relevant variables influencing shipping charges. Doing so shields you from unexpected losses. For instance, if you’re shipping to customers in locations likely to experience violence, you may want to increase your tracking and insurance covers.\\n7. Offer Local or Regional Delivery Services\\nToday, 57% of Americans say they shop locally to support local businesses and keep money in their community. With local shopping, consumers expect expedited delivery time. You must optimize domestic shipping to satisfy consumer expectations and earn local customer loyalty.\\nFortunately, local delivery isn’t hard to execute successfully. You can hire a local fulfillment company to handle your order deliveries for a small fee or use in-house fulfillment by leveraging your existing staff.  If you have local supply chains, regional delivery can be super-convenient thanks to dropshipping.\\nExceeding your customer’s expectations with domestic shipping is efficient and resource-effective, so, as a savvy ecommerce retailer, you should hone in on your local delivery services to capitalize on the buy-local trend and expand your revenue margins.\\nSave on Shipping Rates With Cart.com's Fulfillment Services\\nAt Cart.com, we know firsthand the plight of online retailers losing chunks of their revenues to shipping costs.

They like a product, and the price is right – and then what? Conversion is also often dependent on shipping time and cost. A recent shipping survey found that shoppers overwhelmingly prefer free shipping to fast shipping but that 41% of consumers will pay shipping for a product they want, and 32% will proceed with an order if the cost is reasonable. Shipping costs require strategy – and the ability to calculate and estimate. If you don’t optimize shipping costs for you and the customer, it can affect profits and growth. In this article, we’ll walk you through the shipping process, strategies and how to calculate ecommerce shipping costs so you can make decisions that improve customer satisfaction without affecting your bottom line. \\nFrom order to doorstep: What influences shipping costs\\nShipping is a complex process with many components. Orders come in, are processed, picked and packed, labeled and shipped. Each of those steps precedes the actual shipping and shipping cost per order.\\nSeveral factors influence the full cost of shipping a product:\\nPackage dimensions and weight\\nMajor carriers use a pricing calculation method called dimensional weight (DIM weight). It uses the size of your product – length x width x height – of the package or box size and divides it by a DIM divisor. However, if your package is heavy, weight will determine shipping. In other words, your package is evaluated by weight or dimensions, whichever affects the price more.\\nDestination\\nShipping zones are the geographical areas that carriers use to calculate shipping rates. They are used to determine shipping costs and delivery timeframes based on distance. A package traveling coast to coast will cost more than one traveling to the next zip code.\\nDelivery timeframe\\nCurrent customer demands for short (even same-day) deliveries add a layer of complexity for ecommerce businesses. Shipping costs are based on delivery timeframes as well. Something sent 2- or 3-day shipping versus economy will cost more. And yet, expedited shipping has become an expectation, with 62% of shoppers expecting orders to arrive in less than three business days.\\nShipping insurance and package contents\\nIf your product is high value, you might add insurance. Other types of content also affect pricing, such as if an item is fragile. Insurance protects these items against loss, theft and damage.\\nUnexpected issues\\nPackages in transit can be affected by things outside your control. Weather, accidents and other random occurrences can delay or prevent a delivery. Brands must budget for potential shipping issues to ensure the customer experience is positive by resolving any problems swiftly.\\nHow to charge for shipping\\nShipping expenses are something brands should monitor constantly. Keeping track allows you to assess losses incurred by shipping costs and make strategic, informed decisions to offset them, especially when offering free shipping or running shipping promotions.\\nToday’s retailers must offer affordable shipping rates and provide seamless shipping experiences to satisfy their customers – and there are ways to determine shipping costs strategically. You can:\\n  Decide on a shipping price strategy. Will you:\\nOffer free shipping?\\nCharge flat rates?\\nCharge case by case?\\nOffer free shipping after a certain order amount?\\nShip economy for free and charge for expedited?\\nGive free shipping to loyalty members?\\nHave shipping promotions during peak periods?\\nCharge a customized rate for items with high DIM weights?\\n  Determine speed and carrier. Will you:\\nShip economy or expedited? Will you charge more for expedited?\\nUse ground or air?\\nUse a 3PL service for fulfillment and shipping?\\n  Ways to reduce shipping costs\\nFree shipping for all is a fantastic idea – but it’s not reasonable for every ecommerce brand. Instead, look for ways to reduce shipping costs so you can pass on those savings to your customers. Some of the best places to find savings are:\\nDecrease shipping distances\\nYou instantly lower shipping costs when reducing the number of zones packages travel. You can do this using a multi-node fulfillment strategy, which allows you to distribute inventory nearer to customers. Multiple nodes can also shorten delivery timeframes, further improving the customer experience.\\nOffer flat-rate shipping\\nFlat-rate shipping charges a fixed shipping fee for the service if the item fits into the package dimensions provided. In addition, packing materials are often part of the shipping rate, making it a cost-effective option. A flat-rate shipping strategy can help you standardize costs, but it’s crucial to assess whether it’s a good fit given your current volume and product characteristics.\\nReduce the weight and dimensions of your package\\nAnalyzing your current packaging can help you find ways to reduce current dimensions and weight. For example, look for ways to rearrange, fold, flatten, vacuum seal or use custom-shaped packaging that minimizes the size. You can also reduce weight by using lighter-weight packing materials.\\nConsolidate shipments\\nAnytime you consolidate shipments or multiple orders, it may save you money. Sending an order in multiple shipments can cost more than just the shipping fee. You may also need to buy extra packaging materials for each shipment, which adds additional expenses. Customers often feel frustrated with split shipments, meaning you boost satisfaction when you consolidate as well.\\nGet discounted shipping rates\\nOften, there are perks to sending a high volume of packages. You can receive discounts by negotiating with carriers or utilizing their business solutions. Talking to different carriers is beneficial as well. Gathering information will allow you to make the best decision, even if it means moving to a competitor to save money.\\nPartner with a 3PL\\nFor many ecommerce brands, looking at fulfillment and shipping as symbiotic is beneficial. At a certain point, your inventory is offsite and you’re have to manage a high volume of orders while shipping, tracking and replenishing stock.\\nMany 3PL services have access to wholesale rates. This is an instant save on shipping costs. Additionally, a 3PL partner with multiple fulfillment centers offers shorter transit times, giving you the ability to reduce shipping timeframes.\\nOptimize your shipping strategy with Cart.com\\nShipping has become a critical part of the overall retail customer experience.

In this edition, we welcome Remington Tonar, Co-Founder and Chief Growth Officer at Cart.com. Join us as Remington discusses starting a company during the pandemic, building trust with customers, and reaching the lofty unicorn status. \\nCompany Snapshot\\nName: Cart.com\\nHeadquarters: Houston\\nYear founded: 2020\\nNumber of Employees: 1,500\\nCan you provide some basic information on your company?\\nCart.com is a unified commerce and logistics company that leverages software, AI, and our network of fulfillment centers to solve the inventory, supply chain, and fulfillment challenges facing various industries.\\nFor merchants, Cart.com offers commerce solutions that help efficiently manage, list, advertise, sell, and distribute products across channels. These solutions include software and software-enabled services, which include channel, order & inventory management software, marketplace services, and software-enabled fulfillment services.\\nRemington Tonar\\nWe support more than 6,000 D2C, B2C, and B2B companies and more than 75 million orders per year. Our customers include retailers like TOMS, PacSun, Draper James, and Janie and Jack as well as a range of public sector agencies and large enterprises requiring software-enabled inventory and order management, as well as logistics and fulfillment services.\\nWhat inspired you to start this business, and what gap in the market are you trying to fill?\\nAs e-commerce continued to grow in popularity, we saw a challenge that was increasingly difficult for retailers to solve: the operating environment for sellers was becoming more and more fragmented. It was becoming harder for brands to meet customers’ demands across a growing number of digital and physical touchpoints.\\nThis problem was particularly salient for our Founder and CEO, Omair Tariq, who was an executive at D2C retailer Blinds.com, which was acquired by The Home Depot where he went on to be a key member of the HomeDepot.com leadership team.  We set out to solve this commerce complexity by unifying the capabilities required to sell across channels seamlessly at scale. Cart.com’s initial vision was to build a unified cart that enables customers to buy across channels seamlessly and allows sellers to cart products wherever they need to go efficiently. Following several strategic acquisitions, the company now offers a comprehensive set of pre and post-purchase software and services that allow merchants to unify, manage, and automate marketing, sales, and distribution channels to meet their customers wherever they are while scaling more profitably.\\nCan you share your experience in obtaining funding for your venture?\\nWhen we founded the company in late 2020, e-commerce was experiencing an incredible acceleration due to the pandemic. By the end of 2021, e-commerce sales were still pacing at 50% greater than the same period in 2019. So we saw incredible excitement from investors in our vision and the larger opportunity.\\nIn the following years, the growth rate of e-commerce largely normalized and capital became more expensive. With that, we saw most investors shift their north star metric to profitability over growth. What makes Cart.com unique in this environment is that we’ve been focused on delivering both since our inception.\\nRelated News: Modex 2024 StartUp Award Winners Announced | Cart.com Unveils New AI-Powered Platform\\nIn mid-2023, we announced a successful Series C fundraiser and reached unicorn status. By the end of the year, we not only grew revenue by 50%, but we also achieved sustainable profitability.  Still, the cautious capital environment has generally meant it is harder and takes longer to fundraise, even as a financially sound and growing company.\\nCan you share any challenges that you had to overcome in building your business?\\nLike any new startup entering a fairly established industry, we anticipated building trust with potential customers – particularly established, mature brands and large enterprises – would be a challenge.  We came to market with the big idea of connecting the entire commerce value chain, enabling retailers and enterprises to better connect their data and operations, consolidate vendors, and save money. The surprise was how quickly we were able to establish trust with some of the largest global brands and enterprises and scale our growth.\\n“We came to market with the big idea of connecting the entire commerce value chain, enabling retailers and enterprises to better connect their data and operations, consolidate vendors, and save money. The surprise was how quickly we were able to establish trust with some of the largest global brands and enterprises and scale our growth.”  \\n  Our customers tell us this is a combination of both the strength of our innovation and technology as well as the strength of our leadership team, which includes a wide range of industry veterans and top operators with decades of experience in e-commerce and logistics. By bringing in that talent, we gained a global perspective on the key areas where technology could solve supply chain challenges, enabling us to build out an offering that delivers the performance and results our customers require to compete in a fiercely competitive and complex e-commerce landscape. As we’ve built out our own track record of reliability and innovation, we’ve been able to compete for and win bigger and bigger deals and are now proud to work with some of the most beloved retailers and most trusted enterprises in the industry. \\nWhat's your approach to building a team and company culture?\\nWe founded Cart.com during the pandemic, which meant that the company was remote-first from the beginning. So our first challenge was simply to build a sense of purpose and culture across an all-remote workforce. As we moved into 2021 and 2022, we acquired several companies that added hundreds of employees based all around the world. These companies all had their pre-existing histories and cultures that we then had to integrate and unite into one larger company.\\nAt the same time, Cart.com was growing organically, which meant that we were hiring new employees across teams at an incredibly rapid pace. We believe all of these elements – intentional or not – helped us build the incredibly diverse workforce we have today. As a company working to unify the disparate and fragmented pieces of the commerce value chain for customers, having this diversity across backgrounds, skill sets, industries, functions,  and locations, helps us bring in different perspectives that ultimately help us serve our customers better.\\nHow do you differentiate your product from competitors in the market?\\nCart.com is the only major player unifying commerce across sales and distribution channels as well as across digital and physical capabilities. On the front end, our software helps merchants automate and manage listings across 2,000+ social and shopping channels as well as across all major marketplaces. We also offer white-glove services like growth marketing, marketplace optimization, and customer support for brands. On the back end, we operate 14 tech-enabled omnichannel fulfillment centers, helping brands pick, pack, ship, and store products for any channel. Our goal is to make it easier for brands to sell and fulfill products wherever their customers are while helping them drive more efficient growth.\\nWhat does the future hold for Cart.com? \\nWe're continuing to invest in software and capabilities that provide our customers with a robust, interconnected infrastructure that optimizes and orchestrates the digital and physical aspects of selling and fulfilling in a scalable and profitable way.\\n“Our goal is to make it easier for brands to sell and fulfill products wherever their customers are while helping them drive more efficient growth.”\\n  Last month, we announced the expanded availability of our proprietary AI-powered Order Management System, Constellation OMS, to customers outside our fulfillment network. Constellation OMS was built to help retailers unify order and inventory management, solve supply chain and fulfillment challenges, improve cost efficiency and drive growth.\\nInventory and channel orchestration challenges have cost enterprises billions and slowed growth rates in recent years. We believe a unified order management system is key to winning in the omnichannel world and AI is the most powerful tool for navigating the current environment successfully - as long as it’s connected across every touchpoint in a retailer's commerce value chain.\\nAs we layer in more and more of these AI-backed capabilities, including Inventory and Demand Forecasting, we’ll be able to take much of the guesswork out of product marketing and inventory management. We’ve already seen that connecting marketing and order data can improve traditional forecasting by up to 55%. Our model takes a look at online and offline campaign metrics, social media trends, and ad spend efficiency to calculate the direct impact of marketing efforts on demand spikes and customer purchasing patterns down to the SKU level. We then combine that with historical order data to forecast future demand, which can better predict where you might have excess inventory or a stock out issue. Overall, this helps retailers increase advertising efficiency while also helping 3PLs have better insights for labor demand planning, which drives cost savings on both the pre-purchase and post-purchase sides of the business.\\nWhat trends or changes do you foresee impacting your industry in the coming years?\\nThere are two key trends – both of which point to a more unified commerce experience for merchants and customers – that we believe will have major impacts on the industry in the coming years. In the short term, consolidation is a big focus. We’ve already seen the beginning of some M&A activity, but we are also hearing from companies looking to streamline the number of vendors they work with to drive cost savings and overall efficiency.\\nDuring the pandemic, when capital was cheaper and growth was easier, you saw many brands follow a single-channel strategy. Post-pandemic, however, any brand (or vendor) that was overly reliant on any one channel has likely struggled to deliver growth and control their margins given competitive dynamics, pricing, advertising costs, and constantly evolving consumer shopping habits. Brands that will win in this environment understand that they have to diversify their channel mix to improve sales and margin, streamline the number of vendors they have supporting each channel to reduce costs and unify their data and operations across channels to achieve a complete picture of their business.\\nIn the long term, the application of artificial intelligence across the commerce value chain will bring some exciting capabilities that enable merchants to work more efficiently and more accurately predict demand and in turn reduce costs. Among the things we’re already working on at Cart.com: leveraging generative AI and LLMs to optimize and automate merchandising across thousands of direct and marketplace channels, applying machine learning to automate and synchronize repricing in real-time and using AI-powered demand forecasting that ingests data like marketing and sales history, seasonality, current ecommerce performance and projected marketing campaign activity to deliver a more accurate picture of demand down to the SKU level. \\nBy focusing on unifying data and operations across these disparate channels and systems, brands ultimately benefit from better intelligence and more control – all while running a more efficient operation.\\n  Get Supply Chain News Delivered\\nGet supply chain, ware­house and trans­port­ation news de­livered direct to your in-box and learn about new tech­nol­ogies and tech­niques for improving your op­er­ations.

read\\nAuthor\\nProShip Shipping Experts\\nIf DIM weight surcharges and the like are increasing your parcel costs, here are the steps you can take to mitigate their effects.\\nWhile shipping may seem simple to customers (or even company executives), shipping managers know that it’s anything but. Much more goes into shipping than simply getting the order from the warehouse to the customer’s home. Shippers must take into account when the customer wants to receive their order, the packaging and, of course, the shipping costs. They must also keep up with the latest technologies and regulations in the constantly changing shipping industry. Case in point: dimensional (DIM) weight.\\nA Closer Look at Dimensional (DIM) Weight\\nIt’s hard to believe, but DIM weight was first introduced to ground shipments only four years ago. Before then, shippers were simply charged for the weight of their shipment, no matter the size of the parcel. All of that changed when two of the largest carriers, FedEx and UPS, introduced DIM weight pricing for all ground shipments.\\nAs many know, DIM weight is normally calculated for ground shipments by the length, width, and height of each parcel that is over three cubic feet, regardless of the shipment’s weight. This was a big change for shippers in 2015, especially since many of them experienced significantly higher shipping costs – some as high as 30%. Unfortunately, these DIM weight rates are only continuing to increase each year, forcing many shippers to continue to find new ways to combat these higher shipping charges as to avoid impacting their bottom line.\\nDownload eBook\\nStrategies for Reducing Shipping Costs While Still Meeting Customer Demands\\nFor this reason, shippers are constantly reviewing their shipping procedures and turning to different solutions and shipping strategies. By leveraging the following strategies, companies can exponentially reduce shipping costs while still meeting customer demands.\\nRenegotiate shipping contracts with multiple carriers.\\nBefore reaching out to your main shipping carriers to negotiate better rates and update contracts, obtain rates from all viable carriers. It may seem obvious, but knowing what company offers the lowest rate can help you negotiate with your current carriers, as well as update your contract. Your carrier is able to review the number of parcels your company shipped per day/month/year and the average parcel size so they can create a unique contract designed just for your business. This will dramatically save on shipping costs and help boost business.\\nConsider a variety of carriers, including both regional and local.\\nMany companies may not realize local couriers can transport shipments 80 to 100 miles within a specified zone. This is an excellent mode of transportation for last-mile delivery as it can provide a personalized, caring service for customers. Regional carriers also offer longer time schedules for pick-up and delivery, and they can even provide next-day delivery options to meet customer expectations. These carriers are especially beneficial for shippers as these services are oftentimes more cost-effective than large carriers, and not all utilize DIM weight surcharges.\\nDesign packaging with DIM weight in mind.\\nIt’s no surprise DIM weight charges impact large lightweight items the most. However, all oversized parcels are losing shippers money. This is why it’s critical shippers design packaging that better fits these items in order to create the smallest parcel possible.\\nTo do this, shippers can begin stocking many different types of parcel sizes in order to create these custom-fit packages. However, some shippers have found this strategy is not always feasible due to warehouse space. In these cases, shippers incorporate automated packaging solutions into the order fulfillment process. These systems measure, construct, tape, weigh, and label each order while creating a fit-to-size package. These parcels can be created in as little as seven seconds using only one operator, which allows for better efficiencies. These systems can also auto-box thousands of single- or multi-item orders per day, creating fit-to-size parcels with the lowest DIM weight.\\nRate shop carriers and services using multi-carrier shipping software.\\nMany shippers turn to shipping software that automatically rate shops their carriers and services to identify the best shipping option for every order, no matter the DIM weight. These shippers have found they can save a minimum of six percent in shipping costs and have increased savings with many different regional carriers and services, even without established contracts. Rate shopping also provides shippers with increased negotiating powers when the time comes to renegotiate with their current carrier contracts.\\nWhile DIM weight surcharges are a constant pain point for shippers, there are many strategies and solutions that can be incorporated into the fulfillment process that alleviate increased shipping costs. From updating contracts to utilizing multiple shipping carriers to new technologies, these solutions are easy to incorporate and can save you thousands. In the end, when the only constant in the shipping industry is change, shippers need to incorporate the best strategies and solutions into the warehouse in order to keep up with regulations and boost business.\\nJustin Cramer is Head of Sales & Marketing and Co-Founder at ProShip, Inc, the global provider of today’s #1 multi-carrier shipping software.

Anderson\\nCustomers love the ecommerce experience, particularly the add-to-cart button.Of course, it’s all fun and games until they get to the payment button and review the shipping costs.If your shipping costs are too high, 43% of shoppers will abandon their carts, according to a study conducted by Comscore.That’s too much revenue potential going down the drain.To avoid such pitfalls, you must find ways to reduce shipping costs to gain and retain e-shoppers in the hyper-competitive eCommerce space.Here are six tips you can apply to save on shipping costs.How to Enhance Your Shipping Costs\\nWhile you can’t avoid eCommerce shipping costs altogether, you can cut back on your order delivery costs by following these tips:\\n1.Fit Your Items Into the Right-Sized Packages\\nUsing the right-sized packages has multiple benefits.Firstly, it reduces the cost and hassle of securing the product inside the box with cushioning material such as bubble wrap or styrofoam.When an item fits precisely in the package box, you’ll use less filler material to cushion it from impact and restrict it from shuffling inside the box while in transit.This reduces your overall cost of packaging.You can use these cost savings to lower your shipping charges.Secondly, right-sized packages keep the dimensional weight of your packages at a minimum.For instance, if you sell smartphones but package them in TV-sized boxes, the dimensional weight will be higher even when the weight of the product is lower.In that case, you would pay unnecessarily high shipping rates.Conversely, using the right-sized packages keeps your shipping charges at a fair minimum.2.Reduce Package Weight as Much as You Can\\nThe heavier your packages are, the more shipping costs you or your customers will pay.Package weight is a significant price determinant, especially when you choose air freight because of weight limits.Because you can’t reduce the actual weight of your products, your only solution is to use lightweight packaging materials.Fortunately, there are many lightweight packaging materials to choose from, depending on the size and fragility of your items.These materials include:\\nWater-activated tape (WAT)\\nFoam inserts\\nCorrugated boxes\\nAstro foam\\nAluminum composite panel\\nBubble envelopes\\nEco-Range Boxes\\nWhen shipping heavy items such as gym equipment, you may want to disassemble them and place them in multiple packages for easier shipping.While that may not reduce your fulfillment costs, it’ll ease handling and reduce the chances of freight damage.3.Calculate the Cost of Shipping Within Product Price\\nAccording to Convey, 36% of eCommerce businesses are concerned about shipping costs and the growing consumer expectations about low-cost shipping or free delivery.Today’s shoppers expect affordable shipping and will quickly exit your online store if you charge higher shipping rates.This becomes a dilemma for ecommerce retailers.On the one hand, you can’t escape the rising shipping costs.On the other hand, you want to entice customers with free or low-cost shipping options and increase your Average Order Value (AOV) in the process.The best way to address this dilemma is by tweaking your pricing to include the shipping costs as part of the product price.This way, your customers won’t feel they are paying an extra premium for shipping.More importantly, it’ll allow you to capitalize on the decoy effect brought about by the psychological appeal of free shipping.4.Use a Flat-Rate Shipping Method Whenever You Can\\nFlat-rate shipping is an excellent shipping strategy you can use to standardize your order delivery costs.With flat-rate shipping, your shipping charges are determined solely by the size of your package, not the dimensional weight of the product you’re shipping.Additionally, flat-rate shipping saves you from peak season surcharges (PSS) that can eat into your profit margins when shipping during the holidays.Overall, flat rate shipping shields you from the cost variations caused by changes in dimensional weight, peak season surcharges, and shipping distance.In turn, you can protect your online shoppers from unexpected shipping costs.5.Compare Different Shipping Carrier Prices\\nWith the many shipping carriers operating today, you have the liberty to compare shipping rates and choose the most affordable ones.You can leverage shipping comparison sites or an online shipping calculator to compare carrier prices and get the best deal.With the most affordable shipping solutions, you’ll be better placed to pass down the cost benefits to your customers.6.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"+QP++fizppci8rokvlY/mpny21FtkuKoPN46FieYALo=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0480dc8a-b2dc-40e9-aece-94af71b41a93":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0480dc8a-b2dc-40e9-aece-94af71b41a93\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cart.com/blog/seven-tips-for-optimizing-shipping-costs\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"043d55cb-7c4c-4a9a-b714-af18ba866211\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cart.com/blog/seven-tips-for-optimizing-shipping-costs\"},\"hash\":\"CoJxH+YlqJAx/nRqriVEc7m95JiSfhZze0eVHu22ilc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"948634cb-e049-41a2-b409-c75e5055af50\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cart.com/blog/seven-tips-for-optimizing-shipping-costs\"},\"hash\":\"+QP++fizppci8rokvlY/mpny21FtkuKoPN46FieYALo=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"3f40a98c-07ee-471c-b251-c70bd6b61c5c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"RyE0VvsrQ/PkdF4OfBBW1W6fIbCfUh1yJe0MyVFLO6E=\"}},\"text\":\"With

Other Variables\\nLike any other economic activity, external factors affect shipping costs.These include:\\nCustoms and duties\\nTracking and insurance\\nHandling costs\\nEconomic factors such as inflation\\nSocial factors such as insecurity or political instability in delivery locations\\nYou must account for these and other relevant variables influencing shipping charges.Doing so shields you from unexpected losses.For instance, if you’re shipping to customers in locations likely to experience violence, you may want to increase your tracking and insurance covers.7.Offer Local or Regional Delivery Services\\nToday, 57% of Americans say they shop locally to support local businesses and keep money in their community.With local shopping, consumers expect expedited delivery time.You must optimize domestic shipping to satisfy consumer expectations and earn local customer loyalty.Fortunately, local delivery isn’t hard to execute successfully.You can hire a local fulfillment company to handle your order deliveries for a small fee or use in-house fulfillment by leveraging your existing staff.If you have local supply chains, regional delivery can be super-convenient thanks to dropshipping.Exceeding your customer’s expectations with domestic shipping is efficient and resource-effective, so, as a savvy ecommerce retailer, you should hone in on your local delivery services to capitalize on the buy-local trend and expand your revenue margins.Save on Shipping Rates With Cart.com's Fulfillment Services\\nAt Cart.com, we know firsthand the plight of online retailers losing

Wolfe\\nEcommerce customers move through the buyer’s journey based on a series of information they receive.They like a product, and the price is right – and then what?Conversion is also often dependent on shipping time and cost.A recent shipping survey found that shoppers overwhelmingly prefer free shipping to fast shipping but that 41% of consumers will pay shipping for a product they want, and 32% will proceed with an order if the cost is reasonable.Shipping costs require strategy – and the ability to calculate and estimate.If you don’t optimize shipping costs for you and the customer, it can affect profits and growth.In this article, we’ll walk you through the shipping process, strategies and how to calculate ecommerce shipping costs so you can make decisions that improve customer satisfaction without affecting your bottom line.From order to doorstep: What influences shipping costs\\nShipping is a complex process with many components.Orders come in, are processed, picked and packed, labeled and shipped.Each of those steps precedes the actual shipping and shipping cost per order.Several factors influence the full cost of shipping a product:\\nPackage dimensions and weight\\nMajor carriers use a pricing calculation method called dimensional weight (DIM weight).It uses the size of your product – length x width x height – of the package or box size and divides it by a DIM divisor.However, if your package is heavy, weight will determine shipping.In other words, your package is evaluated by weight or dimensions, whichever affects the price more.Destination\\nShipping zones are the geographical areas that carriers use to calculate shipping rates.They are used to determine shipping costs and delivery timeframes based on distance.A package traveling coast to coast will cost more than one traveling to the next zip code.Delivery timeframe\\nCurrent customer demands for short (even same-day) deliveries add a layer of complexity for ecommerce businesses.Shipping costs are based on delivery timeframes as well.Something sent 2- or 3-day shipping versus economy will cost more.And yet, expedited shipping has become an expectation, with 62% of shoppers expecting orders to arrive in less than three business days.Shipping insurance and package contents\\nIf your product is high value, you might add insurance.Other types of content also affect pricing, such as if an item is fragile.Insurance protects these items against loss, theft and damage.Unexpected issues\\nPackages in transit can be affected by things outside your control.Weather, accidents and other random occurrences can delay or prevent a delivery.Brands must budget for potential shipping issues to ensure the customer experience is positive by resolving any problems swiftly.How to charge for shipping\\nShipping expenses are something brands should monitor constantly.Keeping track allows you to assess losses incurred by shipping costs and make strategic, informed decisions to offset them, especially when offering free shipping or running shipping promotions.Today’s retailers must offer affordable shipping rates and provide seamless shipping experiences to satisfy their customers – and there are ways to determine shipping costs strategically.You can:\\n  Decide on a shipping price strategy.Will you:\\nOffer free shipping?Charge flat rates?Charge case by case?Offer free shipping after a certain order amount?Ship economy for free and charge for expedited?Give free shipping to loyalty members?Have shipping promotions during peak periods?Charge a customized rate for items with high DIM weights?Determine speed and carrier.Will you:\\nShip economy or expedited?Will you charge more for expedited?Use ground or air?Use a 3PL service for fulfillment and shipping?Ways to reduce shipping costs\\nFree shipping for all is a fantastic idea – but it’s not reasonable for every ecommerce brand.Instead, look for ways to reduce shipping costs so you can pass on those savings to your customers.Some of the best places to find savings are:\\nDecrease shipping distances\\nYou instantly lower shipping costs when reducing the number of zones packages travel.You can do this using a multi-node fulfillment strategy, which allows you to distribute inventory nearer to customers.Multiple nodes can also shorten delivery timeframes, further improving the customer experience.Offer flat-rate shipping\\nFlat-rate shipping charges a fixed shipping fee for the service if the item fits into the package dimensions provided.In addition, packing materials are often part of the shipping rate, making it a cost-effective option.A flat-rate shipping strategy can help you standardize costs, but it’s crucial to assess whether it’s a good fit given your current volume and product characteristics.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"9WtfyT+nH+eNga7n1h+dTNUBn8T2vczI/JSDgc1N/18=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"436f0d57-1b0b-499f-871b-15213c3b3a06":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"436f0d57-1b0b-499f-871b-15213c3b3a06\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cart.com/blog/cost-ecommerce-shipping-strategy\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ff2e80ab-b313-493d-afe1-69120cda2620\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cart.com/blog/cost-ecommerce-shipping-strategy\"},\"hash\":\"nIWOT2K7RIbaYAesIW3VW/q/VpbWX45Qvujo1f25lxk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"db3a6200-adeb-450a-8a31-8fd9b3fbc2e0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cart.com/blog/cost-ecommerce-shipping-strategy\"},\"hash\":\"9WtfyT+nH+eNga7n1h+dTNUBn8T2vczI/JSDgc1N/18=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"99c5b1f7-2f01-4bec-bcc1-20d25fa2f10e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"FVbbDizdBpzkR+1Ba5nCBMeQAA/uZyd5ZHbN21TFfXA=\"}},\"text\":\"Use

lighter-weight packing materials.Consolidate shipments\\nAnytime you consolidate shipments or multiple orders, it may save you money.Sending an order in multiple shipments can cost more than just the shipping fee.You may also need to buy extra packaging materials for each shipment, which adds additional expenses.Customers often feel frustrated with split shipments, meaning you boost satisfaction when you consolidate as well.Get discounted shipping rates\\nOften, there are perks to sending a high volume of packages.You can receive discounts by negotiating with carriers or utilizing their business solutions.Talking to different carriers is beneficial as well.Gathering information will allow you to make the best decision, even if it means moving to a competitor to save money.Partner with a 3PL\\nFor many ecommerce brands, looking at fulfillment and shipping as symbiotic is beneficial.At a certain point, your inventory is offsite and you’re have to manage a high volume of orders while shipping, tracking and replenishing stock.Many 3PL services have access to wholesale rates.This is an instant save on shipping costs.Additionally, a 3PL partner with multiple fulfillment centers offers shorter transit times, giving you the ability to reduce shipping timeframes.Optimize your shipping strategy with Cart.com\\nShipping has become a critical part of the overall retail customer

unicorn status.By Andy Gray April 17, 2024\\n\\nWelcome to Startup Spotlight, where we shine a light on innovative companies transforming the supply chain industry.In this edition, we welcome Remington Tonar, Co-Founder and Chief Growth Officer at Cart.com.Join us as Remington discusses starting a company during the pandemic, building trust with customers, and reaching the lofty unicorn status.Company Snapshot\\nName: Cart.com\\nHeadquarters: Houston\\nYear founded: 2020\\nNumber of Employees: 1,500\\nCan you provide some basic information on your company?Cart.com is a unified commerce and logistics company that leverages software, AI, and our network of fulfillment centers to solve the inventory, supply chain, and fulfillment challenges facing various industries.For merchants, Cart.com offers commerce solutions that help efficiently manage, list, advertise, sell, and distribute products across channels.These solutions include software and software-enabled services, which include channel, order & inventory management software, marketplace services, and software-enabled fulfillment services.Remington Tonar\\nWe support more than 6,000 D2C, B2C, and B2B companies and more than 75 million orders per year.Our customers include retailers like TOMS, PacSun, Draper James, and Janie and Jack as well as a range of public sector agencies and large enterprises requiring software-enabled inventory and order management, as well as logistics and fulfillment services.What inspired you to start this business, and what gap in the market are you trying to fill?As e-commerce continued to grow in popularity, we saw a challenge that was increasingly difficult for retailers to solve: the operating environment for sellers was becoming more and more fragmented.It was becoming harder for brands to meet customers’ demands across a growing number of digital and physical touchpoints.This problem was particularly salient for our Founder and CEO, Omair Tariq, who was an executive at D2C retailer Blinds.com, which was acquired by The Home Depot where he went on to be a key member of the HomeDepot.com leadership team.We set out to solve this commerce complexity by unifying the capabilities required to sell across channels seamlessly at scale.Cart.com’s initial vision was to build a unified cart that enables customers to buy across channels seamlessly and allows sellers to cart products wherever they need to go efficiently.Following several strategic acquisitions, the company now offers a comprehensive set of pre and post-purchase software and services that allow merchants to unify, manage, and automate marketing, sales, and distribution channels to meet their customers wherever they are while scaling more profitably.Can you share your experience in obtaining funding for your venture?When we founded the company in late 2020, e-commerce was experiencing an incredible acceleration due to the pandemic.By the end of 2021, e-commerce sales were still pacing at 50% greater than the same period in 2019.So we saw incredible excitement from investors in our vision and the larger opportunity.In the following years, the growth rate of e-commerce largely normalized and capital became more expensive.With that, we saw most investors shift their north star metric to profitability over growth.What makes Cart.com unique in this environment is that we’ve been focused on delivering both since our inception.Related News: Modex 2024 StartUp Award Winners Announced | Cart.com Unveils New AI-Powered Platform\\nIn mid-2023, we announced a successful Series C fundraiser and reached unicorn status.By the end of the year, we not only grew revenue by 50%, but we also achieved sustainable profitability.Still, the cautious capital environment has generally meant it is harder and takes longer to fundraise, even as a financially sound and growing company.Can you share any challenges that you had to overcome in building your business?Like any new startup entering a fairly established industry, we anticipated building trust with potential customers – particularly established, mature brands and large enterprises – would be a challenge.We came to market with the big idea of connecting the entire commerce value chain, enabling retailers and enterprises to better connect their data and operations, consolidate vendors, and save money.The surprise was how quickly we were able to establish trust with some of the largest global brands and enterprises and scale our growth.“We came to market with the big idea of

scale our growth.”Our customers tell us this is a combination of both the strength of our innovation and technology as well as the strength of our leadership team, which includes a wide range of industry veterans and top operators with decades of experience in e-commerce and logistics.By bringing in that talent, we gained a global perspective on the key areas where technology could solve supply chain challenges, enabling us to build out an offering that delivers the performance and results our customers require to compete in a fiercely competitive and complex e-commerce landscape.As we’ve built out our own track record of reliability and innovation, we’ve been able to compete for and win bigger and bigger deals and are now proud to work with some of the most beloved retailers and most trusted enterprises in the industry.What's your approach to building a team and company culture?We founded Cart.com during the pandemic, which meant that the company was remote-first from the beginning.So our first challenge was simply to build a sense of purpose and culture across an all-remote workforce.As we moved into 2021 and 2022, we acquired several companies that added hundreds of employees based all around the world.These companies all had their pre-existing histories and cultures that we then had to integrate and unite into one larger company.At the same time, Cart.com was growing organically, which meant that we were hiring new employees across teams at an incredibly rapid pace.We believe all of these elements – intentional or not – helped us build the incredibly diverse workforce we have today.As a company working to unify the disparate and fragmented pieces of the commerce value chain for customers, having this diversity across backgrounds, skill sets, industries, functions,  and locations, helps us bring in different perspectives that ultimately help us serve our customers better.How do you differentiate your product from competitors in the market?Cart.com is the only major player unifying commerce across sales and distribution channels as well as across digital and physical capabilities.On the front end, our software helps merchants automate and manage listings across 2,000+ social and shopping channels as well as across all major marketplaces.We also offer white-glove services like growth marketing, marketplace optimization, and customer support for brands.On the back end, we operate 14 tech-enabled omnichannel fulfillment centers, helping brands pick, pack, ship, and store products for any channel.Our goal is to make it easier for brands to sell and fulfill products wherever their customers are while helping them drive more efficient growth.What does the future hold for Cart.com?We're continuing to invest in software and capabilities that provide our customers with a robust, interconnected infrastructure that optimizes and orchestrates the digital and physical aspects of selling and fulfilling in a scalable and profitable way.“Our goal is to make it easier for brands to sell and fulfill products wherever their customers are while helping them drive more efficient growth.”Last month, we announced the expanded availability of our proprietary AI-powered Order Management System, Constellation OMS, to customers outside our fulfillment network.Constellation OMS was built to help retailers unify order and inventory management, solve supply chain and fulfillment challenges, improve cost efficiency and drive growth.Inventory and channel orchestration challenges have cost enterprises billions and slowed growth rates in recent years.We believe a unified order management system is key to winning in the omnichannel world and AI is the most powerful tool for navigating the current environment successfully - as long as it’s connected across every touchpoint in a retailer's commerce value chain.As we layer in more and more of these AI-backed capabilities, including Inventory and Demand Forecasting, we’ll be able to take much of the guesswork out of product marketing and inventory management.We’ve already seen that connecting marketing and order data can improve traditional forecasting by up to 55%.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"QUWKgyQthtX9bt8JfEGWaErKTi/AR5im8XK+yU5Qwq0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"59abf046-5521-4381-9056-da3ec56227f7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"59abf046-5521-4381-9056-da3ec56227f7\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.supplychain247.com/article/spotlight-startup-cart-com/pallets\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ca13b6f5-bd73-4ff8-a2c8-9c4f8fd848ef\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.supplychain247.com/article/spotlight-startup-cart-com/pallets\"},\"hash\":\"hYKSDq8s+oHoJ2DZ3otu2lV4lIXll+wU7dbF3aqN3h4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"57a62f6e-e5ec-435a-a1fc-c794cd20897b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.supplychain247.com/article/spotlight-startup-cart-com/pallets\"},\"hash\":\"zJihZfqfZt+9VUS4wU5HboBOs+JkBg+DCzN055lDJHU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"6b0c369f-6c73-4b5a-a281-7954e7cfaac7\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"/xAYL0gqH/PbP0shqsP8EdzBsENpZ0ZYBO6K+QlYoJc=\"}},\"text\":\"Last

Inventory and Demand Forecasting, we’ll be able to take much of the guesswork out of product marketing and inventory management.We’ve already seen that connecting marketing and order data can improve traditional forecasting by up to 55%.Our model takes a look at online and offline campaign metrics, social media trends, and ad spend efficiency to calculate the direct impact of marketing efforts on demand spikes and customer purchasing patterns down to the SKU level.We then combine that with historical order data to forecast future demand, which can better predict where you might have excess inventory or a stock out issue.Overall, this helps retailers increase advertising efficiency while also helping 3PLs have better insights for labor demand planning, which drives cost savings on both the pre-purchase and post-purchase sides of the business.What trends or changes do you foresee impacting your industry in the coming years?There are two key trends – both of which point to a more unified commerce experience for merchants and customers – that we believe will have major impacts on the industry in the coming years.In the short term, consolidation is a big focus.We’ve already seen the beginning of some M&A activity, but we are also hearing from companies looking to streamline the number of vendors they work with to drive cost savings and overall efficiency.During the pandemic, when capital was cheaper and growth was easier, you saw many brands follow a single-channel strategy.Post-pandemic, however, any brand (or vendor) that was overly reliant on any one channel has likely struggled to deliver growth and control their margins given competitive dynamics, pricing, advertising costs, and constantly evolving consumer shopping habits.Brands that will win in this environment understand that they have to diversify their channel mix to improve sales and margin, streamline the number of vendors they have supporting each channel to reduce costs and unify their data and operations across channels to achieve a complete picture of their business.In the long term, the application of artificial intelligence across the commerce value chain will bring some exciting capabilities that enable merchants to work more efficiently and more accurately predict demand and in turn reduce costs.Among the things we’re already working on at Cart.com: leveraging generative AI and LLMs to optimize and automate merchandising across thousands of direct and marketplace channels, applying machine learning to automate and synchronize repricing in real-time and using AI-powered demand forecasting that ingests data like marketing and sales history, seasonality, current ecommerce performance and projected marketing campaign activity to deliver a more accurate picture of demand down to the SKU level.By focusing on unifying data and operations across these disparate channels and systems, brands ultimately benefit from better intelligence and more control – all while running a more efficient operation.Get Supply Chain News Delivered\\nGet supply chain, ware­house and trans­port­ation news de­livered direct to your in-box and learn about new tech­nol­ogies and tech­niques

read\\nAuthor\\nProShip Shipping Experts\\nIf DIM weight surcharges and the like are increasing your parcel costs, here are the steps you can take to mitigate their effects.While shipping may seem simple to customers (or even company executives), shipping managers know that it’s anything but.Much more goes into shipping than simply getting the order from the warehouse to the customer’s home.Shippers must take into account when the customer wants to receive their order, the packaging and, of course, the shipping costs.They must also keep up with the latest technologies and regulations in the constantly changing shipping industry.Case in point: dimensional (DIM) weight.A Closer Look at Dimensional (DIM) Weight\\nIt’s hard to believe, but DIM weight was first introduced to ground shipments only four years ago.Before then, shippers were simply charged for the weight of their shipment, no matter the size of the parcel.All of that changed when two of the largest carriers, FedEx and UPS, introduced DIM weight pricing for all ground shipments.As many know, DIM weight is normally calculated for ground shipments by the length, width, and height of each parcel that is over three cubic feet, regardless of the shipment’s weight.This was a big change for shippers in 2015, especially since many of them experienced significantly higher shipping costs – some as high as 30%.Unfortunately, these DIM weight rates are only continuing to increase each year, forcing many shippers to continue to find new ways to combat these higher shipping charges as to avoid impacting their bottom line.Download eBook\\nStrategies for Reducing Shipping Costs While Still Meeting Customer Demands\\nFor this reason, shippers are constantly reviewing their shipping procedures and turning to different solutions and shipping strategies.By leveraging the following strategies, companies can exponentially reduce shipping costs while still meeting customer demands.Renegotiate shipping contracts with multiple carriers.Before reaching out to your main shipping carriers to negotiate better rates and update contracts, obtain rates from all viable carriers.It may seem obvious, but knowing what company offers the lowest rate can help you negotiate with your current carriers, as well as update your contract.Your carrier is able to review the number of parcels your company shipped per day/month/year and the average parcel size so they can create a unique contract designed just for your business.This will dramatically save on shipping costs and help boost business.Consider a variety of carriers, including both regional and local.Many companies may not realize local couriers can transport shipments 80 to 100 miles within a specified zone.This is an excellent mode of transportation for last-mile delivery as it can provide a personalized, caring service for customers.Regional carriers also offer longer time schedules for pick-up and delivery, and they can even provide next-day delivery options to meet customer expectations.These carriers are especially beneficial for shippers as these services are oftentimes more cost-effective than large carriers, and not all utilize DIM weight surcharges.Design packaging with DIM weight in mind.It’s no surprise DIM weight charges impact large lightweight items the most.However, all oversized parcels are losing shippers money.This is why it’s critical shippers design packaging that better fits these items in order to create the smallest parcel possible.To do this, shippers can begin stocking many different types of parcel sizes in order to create these custom-fit packages.However, some shippers have found this strategy is not always feasible due to warehouse space.In these cases, shippers incorporate automated packaging solutions into the order fulfillment process.These systems measure, construct, tape, weigh, and label each order while creating a fit-to-size package.These parcels can be created in as little as seven seconds using only one operator, which allows for better efficiencies.These systems can also auto-box thousands of single- or multi-item orders per day, creating fit-to-size parcels with the lowest DIM weight.Rate shop carriers and services using multi-carrier shipping software.Many shippers turn to shipping software that automatically rate shops their carriers and services to identify the best shipping option for every order, no matter the DIM weight.These shippers have found they can save a minimum of six percent in shipping costs and have increased savings with many different regional carriers and services, even without established contracts.Rate shopping also provides shippers with increased negotiating powers when the time comes to renegotiate with their current carrier contracts.While DIM weight surcharges are a constant pain point for shippers, there are many strategies and solutions that can be incorporated into the fulfillment process that alleviate increased shipping costs.From updating contracts to utilizing multiple shipping carriers to new technologies, these solutions are easy to incorporate and can save you thousands.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"aCZ4/EPczaxViMNDtVndxxPQZUzmYY05RTxN6sNkcWk=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"05926246-415c-4397-8b58-0af594b1ff33":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"05926246-415c-4397-8b58-0af594b1ff33\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://proshipinc.com/resources/manufacturing/shipping-the-only-constant-is-change\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"fa89a0d2-f5a4-488a-b795-830581e51a76\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://proshipinc.com/resources/manufacturing/shipping-the-only-constant-is-change\"},\"hash\":\"Ks1GPlX06ypgH0ThQGfoH/YIP2szmCLdcbTS9/osZY0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"825f9d86-e16e-411c-ba30-1a90e3df8562\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://proshipinc.com/resources/manufacturing/shipping-the-only-constant-is-change\"},\"hash\":\"aCZ4/EPczaxViMNDtVndxxPQZUzmYY05RTxN6sNkcWk=\"}},\"text\":\"These
