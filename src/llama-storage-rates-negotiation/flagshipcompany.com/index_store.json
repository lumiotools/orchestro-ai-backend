up if you’re not careful.Identifying and correcting common shipping cost mistakes can save you money and improve your bottom line.Here are some key areas to watch out for:\n1.Inaccurate Package Dimensions & Weight Calculations \nMistakes and Their Impact on Shipping Costs\nMistake Impact\nUnderestimating dimensions/weight Couriers charge for actual weight/dimensions, leading to unexpected fees.Overestimating dimensions/weight You pay for more shipping space than needed, cutting into profit margins.Solution: \nUse a high-quality scale and measuring tape to measure package dimensions and

packaging Leads to damaged goods, replacements, refunds, and lost customers.Excessive packaging Adds unnecessary weight, increasing shipping costs.Loose packing Products shift during transit, raising the risk of damage.Solution: \nChoose boxes that fit your product snugly, minimizing extra space to reduce shipping costs.Use high-quality packing materials such as bubble wrap, packing peanuts, or air pillows to secure products.Fill any voids inside the package to prevent movement, and securely seal packages with strong packing tape.Good vs. Bad Packaging Practices\nGood Packaging Materials Bad Packaging Practices\nBubble wrap, peanuts, air pillows Overpacking with heavy or excessive materials\nProperly sized boxes Boxes that are too large or too small\n  Save On Shipping Cost Using These
