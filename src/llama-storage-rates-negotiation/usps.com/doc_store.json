Most carriers tend to revise their rates on a yearly basis. Because demand in the ecommerce industry has increased considerably over the past few years, carriers also need to adjust their rates based on factors ranging from the amount of warehousing space they have available to the distance to be covered in transit.\\nLearning how to reduce shipping costs is incredibly important for your business. Larger corporations like Amazon use free shipping virtually all over the globe to make it harder for the average business owner to compete by offering free shipping virtually all over the globe on pricing. Low shipping costs are therefore a key tool in your arsenal to improve your margins.\\nUnfortunately, this is much easier said than done. There are plenty of factors that affect your shipping costs. For instance, you need to be very careful about the kind of packaging that you use. More importantly, you will also have to conduct careful research in order to figure out which shipping carrier is best suited to your needs.\\nTable of Contents\\n10 Ways to Reduce Shipping Costs\\nNegotiate with Several Carriers\\nWeigh Packages and Shave Dimensions\\nUse Packages Given by Your Carrier\\nLook for Discounted Supplies\\nPay for Shipping Online\\nChoose Prepaid Shipping\\nUse Third Party Insurance\\nBe Accurate with Billing\\nChoose Hybrid Services\\nOpt for Poly Mailers\\nHow Other Entrepreneurs Cut Down on Shipping Costs\\nIs Outsourcing Fulfillment a Good Idea?\\nThere are plenty of different ways by which you can reduce your costs of shipping. Learning how to reduce shipping costs could allow you to generate higher profits. Ultimately the money you save could be better utilized in advancing your business. But how can you reduce your shipping costs? Read on to find out.\\n10 Ways to Reduce Shipping Costs\\nHere are some of the most effective ways that may reduce your average shipping cost.\\n1. Negotiate with Several Carriers\\nToo many businesses stick with the first shipping carrier that they come across. Obviously, that’s a bad idea. Virtually all shipping carriers change their pricing based on volume. The higher the volume, the lower the price.\\nUnfortunately, many small businesses fail to realize that they have a bit of wiggle room when negotiating the price. Visit the offices of a few local carriers, or talk to them over the phone. Familiarize yourself with factors like the size and weight of your package, as well as its origin and destination, and use this information to get a better bargain. Some also offer ecommerce payment processing as a package deal, so you may want to look into that.\\n2. Weigh Packages and Shave Dimensions\\nHeavier packages generally cost more to ship unless you have opted for flat-rate shipping. If you are printing the labels and shipping everything from your garage or a shop, you might want to consider buying a postage scale. This will give you a better idea about the weight of each package, and allow you to calculate the costs more accurately.\\nYou should also try to reduce the dimensions of the package as much as possible. Some companies charge more depending upon the size of the box. If the item is lightweight, there’s no reason to pack it in a big box. Use smaller ones, and you can save a significant amount.\\n3. Use Packages Given by Your Carrier\\nOne of the best ways to reduce shipping costs is to only use the boxes and packaging provided by your carrier. Most carriers like FedEx and UPS charge a dimensional fee if you use your own boxes. It might help with branding, but unless you can afford to incur an extra charge on each package shipped, you should definitely consider using the ecommerce packaging provided by the carrier.\\n4. Look for Discounted Supplies\\nLarger shipping carriers like UPS and FedEx often provide discounted or even free packaging supplies to small business owners. Packaging material like bubble wrap, poly mailers, and dunnage can be purchased in bulk quantities, which will result in additional cost savings for your business.\\n5. Pay for Shipping Online\\nThis might come as a surprise to most people, but you can save up to 16 percent on priority mail orders via USPS by simply paying for shipping online. This figure can go all the way to 60 percent for express shipping, which can be a significant amount when you consider the number of packages shipped each month. On top of that, you also get a free pick-up!\\n6. Choose Prepaid Shipping\\nPrepaid shipping offers a discount of up to 20 percent. What this means is that you buy a bunch of shipping labels and put them on packages when they are going to be shipped out, instead of paying for each when you have to ship it. This is the ideal choice for people who know that same weight packages will be shipped out again and again from their company.\\n7. Use Third Party Insurance\\nShipping insurance can put a serious dent in your profit margins, especially for valuable goods. Most people usually opt for insurance from the shipping company only, but opting for a third party could net you significant savings. It’s usually cheaper than the one your shipping company is going to offer.\\n8. Be Accurate with Billing\\nThere are a whole host of different shipping charges that might be levied on the product, so you need to factor in all of them when billing your customers. If your customer is paying for shipping, send them an accurate estimate so that you don’t have to absorb them.\\n9. Choose Hybrid Services\\nIn certain situations, hybrid services that are offered by logistics companies like UPS and FedEx might be cheaper. These services are generally cheaper, and they will also pick up the packages and ship them to the post office closest to the destination. They do cost less, but you should know that the delivery time is also slower. But, this is a great way to reduce shipping costs.\\n10. Opt for Poly Mailers\\nIf you have to ship non-fragile goods like clothes, you might want to consider using poly mailers instead of boxes. Poly mailers are cheap because they take up less space and reduce packaging costs. Conventional tape can be used for sealing the poly bags.\\nMost people don’t think about it, but you also have to focus on reducing your page load times as much as possible. This will boost orders and improve revenue, so make sure you choose a reliable web store host.\\nCloudways Gives You a Range of Tools like a Profit Margin Calculator to Help Streamline Costs\\nUse these tools to gain an edge over the competition.\\nCHECK NOW!\\nHow Other Entrepreneurs Cut Down on Shipping Costs\\nWe have discussed the best ways to bring down shipping costs. In this section, we shall focus on advice from other entrepreneurs, and the steps they take to reduce shipping costs.\\n1. Partner with a Fulfillment Center\\nCalloway Cook, the President of Illuminate Labs, says that you should partner with a fulfillment center. When you get a 3PL partner, they can negotiate significantly lower shipping rates with all major carriers (both domestic and international) because of their shipping volume. Our current shipping rates are about 30% lower than retail rates thanks to our fulfillment partner company. The other way that a fulfillment partner helps to reduce shipping costs, is by separating your inventory in different warehouses across the country. This allows orders to ship from the closest warehouse, which reduces cost significantly.\\n2. Akram Tariq Khan, Yourlibaas.com\\nAkram Tariq Khan at Yourlibaas.com says it’s best to partner with companies that have similar shipping accounts. We ship over 400 packets daily internationally, primarily within India. The strategies we have adopted are:\\nPartnered with multiple shipping aggregators and courier partners. We have developed a PHP script in-house which requests for quotes from all providers while creating shipping labels and sends shipping requests to the one with the lowest quote.\\nAs courier companies have high surcharges for services like Cash on Delivery, we incentivise users who make online prepaid payments. This results in both shipping costs being reduced and also a reduction in RTO (Return to Origin) shipments. RTO shipments are the ones that aren’t delivered to the receiver due to any reason.\\nReduce the volume of the shipment to reduce volumetric weight. Apart from the actual weight in kilograms/lbs, the courier providers also consider the volume of the package.\\nWe have partnered with a nearby company who uses the same shipping account to ship. We have created a sub-account for them. This results in a higher minimum commitment to the shipping provider and they agree on lower quotes.\\nChoosing which method to ship using through the automated script mentioned earlier. For instance, a package sent through ground shall reach around the same time to a nearby destination. Opting for a faster air delivery would only result in higher charges while the service will be the same. These decisions are made by the script which calculates the distance between the customer’s ZIP code and our warehouse. It can also be done manually for stores with low volume.\\nWant to Learn More About Shipping Costs?\\nRead our comprehensive ecommerce shipping guide.\\nI agree to the Cloudways Terms of Service & Privacy Policy\\nGET IT NOW\\n3. Use Different Sized Boxes and Envelopes\\nMeaghan Thomas, Pinch Spice Market says, “the biggest shipping savings has come from us using Shipping Easy, which connects to our Woocommerce website and lets us compare shops to determine which size of box or padded envelope will be cheapest to ship each order in.\\nThis means we need to have a variety of different sized boxes and padded envelopes on hand. We always have the typical USPS packages/boxes, but we also purchase our own differently sized boxes and envelopes, so we can choose the cheapest rate possible (we happen to buy our boxes/envelopes through Royal Mailers and Uline, but there’s a lot of options out there).\\nThis results in big savings. For example, we’re based in Louisville, KY. If we were to ship spices to a Californian customer via priority mail in our own packaging, it would cost something like $13, but Shipping Easy tells us if we do it via USPS’s own priority packaging, it’s closer to $7.75, a huge savings.\\nOther times, it’s cheaper to use our own packaging; it all depends on the weight and which region it’s shipping to. We’ve also learned using USPS regional A and B boxes are key to getting lower rates. These aren’t available at the local post office – you have to order them online at USPS.com.\\nThese bring big savings (40-60%) when we’re shipping packages shorter distances, let’s say to Illinois or Tennessee. That alone can save us $5-7 per order. As you can see, we primarily use USPS, but there is an exception. If we have a package that weighs over 5 pounds, we turn to UPS, which typically has better rates for higher-weight packages.\\n4. Focus on Reducing Returns\\nDavid DeCorte of Chargebacks911 says, “you can cut shipping costs considerably and encourage customer loyalty by reducing returns. Four out of five customers see free shipping as a plus when deciding whether or not to complete a purchase, and nearly half of all eCommerce businesses now offer it.\\nFree return shipping can be unrealistic, though, if you don’t address the common reasons why buyers request returns. For instance, buyers often justify returns by saying that the products received are incorrect, or that they don’t match the images or description.\\nAn item might be bigger or smaller than expected, or be the wrong color. But, by having detailed product descriptions, accuracy during the fulfillment process, and having a clear and comprehensive return policy listed on the site, a merchant can prevent these losses.\\nThis will have additional, knock-on effects, too. For instance, fewer returns mean a lower overhead and more savings over time. Plus, many of the triggers that can cause a return are also related to chargebacks, which are even more costly.\\n5. Use a Big Company Like FedEx\\nJennifer Mayne of Dorothy Lane Market says, “we ship our great brownies, baked goods and gourmet food gifts all over the country. Many of our gifts and food items are perishable so we spend a lot on shipping. We work closely with FedEx to get our shipping fees lowered.\\nHere are some of the suggestions they have given us and have implemented with success in reducing our costs: Fedex provides reports on the actual weight of each package versus the dimensional weight of each package that we ship. We carefully analyze the report to capture savings.\\nFedEx charges for dimensional weight, so larger boxes cost more. At times we send two smaller boxes as opposed to one very large box due to higher fees for larger dimensional weight. They have done an analysis of our gift boxes to help us figure out less expensive sized boxes to use.\\nWe try to select our food items that go into the gift boxes that have been predetermined as more efficient. It doesn’t always work out, but that is our goal. We also are taking advantage of their new service to do ground delivery on Saturdays. This allows us to use ground more often toward the end of the week if we do not need a guarantee arrival date and the packages are not too perishable.\\nI think once the weather cools down, we will take advantage of this more. Right now with the heat wave in many parts of the country, we have to use a lot of ice and prefer to ship Monday to Wednesday. But when the weather is cooler, we can let shipments go to be delivered on the weekend now.\\nIs Outsourcing Fulfillment a Good Idea?\\nOne of the things that you might have to consider is whether to outsource fulfillment or keep it in house. There’s little doubt that outsourcing fulfillment is going to save you a considerable amount of money on shipping and improve delivery times . But there’s a downside to this as well.\\nWhen you outsource fulfillment, you won’t have any control over operations or inventory. You won’t be able to decide how much to store, what to package, and what to ship your products. More importantly, you won’t have any control over the facilities or the team working in the warehouse.\\nIn the beginning, most businesses prefer to outsource fulfillment because it offers greater cost savings. If you want to outsource to a fulfillment center, you need to evaluate your options considerably. For example, you can hire Los Angeles fulfillment services to cater to your customers in LA. Carefully calculate the cost savings, and then determine whether the trade-off is worth it or not.\\nOutsourcing is ideal for smaller businesses that want to register rapid growth. Once you can afford to spend enough on shipping, you should consider setting up your own fulfillment center.\\nConclusion\\nMany business owners are confused about how to reduce shipping costs. In this article, we have covered multiple strategies that will help you reduce shipping costs by a significant margin, and allow you to focus on business growth. At the end of the day, you need to create a balance and find what works best for your business. More importantly, you should know that shipping costs are dynamic, and you will have to revise your estimations from time to time.\\nFAQs\\nQ1. What is the cheapest shipping method?\\nUPS First class mail is the cheapest shipping method if your parcel weighs less than 16 oz. For shipping physical goods, it’s an incredibly cheap option. However, you should know that the costs vary based on the weight and distance to be covered.\\nQ2. How much does shipping cost?\\nThe shipping costs vary based on several factors such as the distance in transit, the mode of shipping (air or overland), and the weight of the goods being shipped.\\nQ3.

Our no-frills guide presents a clear USPS shipping rates by weight chart to quickly determine your shipping costs. You’ll also find essential insights on how weight influences USPS shipping, ensuring you make informed decisions before sending out your packages.\\nKey Takeaways\\nUSPS shipping rates are determined by weight, dimensions, and destination, with heavier and larger packages generally costing more. The maximum weight for domestic packages is 70 pounds.\\nUSPS offers a variety of shipping options suited for different needs, including First Class Package Service for items up to 13 ounces, and Priority Mail services for faster delivery of heavier packages up to 70 pounds.\\nTo save on shipping costs, USPS provides Flat Rate shipping for packages up to 70 pounds and offers commercial prices with discounts of up to 28% for customers who meet certain criteria, such as volume requirements.\\nUnderstanding USPS Shipping Costs by Weight\\nKnowledge of USPS shipping costs is vital whether you’re an individual sending a package to a loved one or a business owner shipping products to customers. The cost of shipping a package with USPS is primarily determined by three factors: package weight, dimensions, and destination. As a rule of thumb, heavier packages generally incur higher shipping costs, and the size of the package can also affect the cost due to increased handling and transportation requirements.\\nShipping costs also rise with the distance the package needs to travel, due to increased transportation and handling charges.\\nPackage Weight Breakdown\\nWithin USPS shipping, the package’s weight significantly influences the cost.\\nThe shipping costs increase as the weight of the package increases, showing a direct proportionality between the two.\\nHeavier packages result in higher shipping expenses.\\nThe USPS has established several weight categories for shipping, and the maximum weight limit for domestic packages is 70 pounds.\\nIt’s important to note that lower maximum weight standards may apply to APOs, FPOs, and DPOs.\\nUnderstanding this system is key to evade surplus weight charges and choose the suitable shipping service.\\nDetermining Your Package’s Weight\\nTo avoid unexpected shipping fees and ensure correct postage, it’s vital to accurately measure your package’s weight.\\nThe recommended method for accurately measuring package weight for USPS shipment is to use a postal scale, which provides precise measurements for accurate postage calculation.\\nHowever, in the absence of a postal scale, you can use alternative methods such as a bathroom scale or a kitchen scale.\\nWeight Limits and Overweight Packages\\nBesides weight measurement, it’s important to take into account weight limits.\\nUSPS has weight limits for different shipping services, and exceeding these limits may result in additional fees or service restrictions.\\nFor example, Priority Mail allows the shipment of items weighing up to 70 pounds and measuring up to 108 inches in total length and girth.\\nIf a USPS package surpasses the maximum weight limit, it could be returned to the sender or subject to additional postage charges.\\nNavigating USPS Shipping Options\\nUSPS provides a wide array of shipping options, each designed to meet various needs. Some of the options include:\\nFirst Class Package Service: Ideal for parcels weighing 13 ounces or less.\\nPriority Mail: The go-to option for packages over one pound.\\nFirst Class Mail: Has a weight limit of 15.99 ounces.\\nPriority Mail: Renowned for its faster delivery, albeit at a higher cost.\\nDepending on your specific needs, you can choose from a range of options that offer varying delivery times and shipping costs between First Class Mail, Priority Mail, and Priority Mail Express.\\nFirst Class Mail Service\\nFirst Class Mail Service is an affordable option for shipping lightweight packages. \\nThis service has a pricing structure based on weight and destination. For instance, the pricing details include $1.16 for 1 oz, $1.36 for 2 oz, and so on, up to the weight limit of 15.99 ounces.\\nWhile tracking is not provided for small-sized items such as postcards, letters, and flats, it is available for First-Class Package Services at no extra cost, ensuring you can keep tabs on your shipment’s journey.\\nPriority Mail and Priority Mail Express\\nIf speed is of the essence, Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express are the options to consider.\\nUSPS Priority Mail typically delivers within 1-3 business days, while Priority Mail Express offers next-day to 2-day delivery for most destinations. The latter is the most efficient option for ensuring overnight delivery.\\nBoth these services accept packages up to 70 lbs, making them a versatile choice for a wide range of shipping needs.\\nMaximizing Savings with USPS Flat Rate and Commercial Prices\\nWhen it comes to shipping, cost-effectiveness is a primary concern, and USPS addresses this with its Flat Rate and Commercial Prices. The Priority Mail Flat Rate service offers a fixed-rate option for sending packages weighing up to 70 pounds, eliminating the need to weigh each package individually.\\nThis service is particularly advantageous for heavier packages that would otherwise incur higher shipping costs based on their weight. On the other hand, commercial prices provide discounts of up to 28% off retail prices, presenting potential savings for businesses and frequent shippers compared to domestic prices.\\nPriority Mail Flat Rate Solutions\\nPriority Mail Flat Rate solutions offer a single rate regardless of weight, making them a cost-effective option for heavier shipments.\\nThese include Flat Rate Envelopes and Flat Rate Boxes, which are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate different shipping needs.\\nThe costs of these options vary depending on the chosen packaging, with prices ranging from $9.20 for Small Flat Rate Boxes and from $14.75 to $17.10 for Medium Flat Rate Boxes.\\nBear in mind that prices could change and might vary based on location and shipping method.\\nAccessing Lower Commercial Rates\\nLower commercial rates can offer extra savings for businesses.\\nBy meeting specific criteria such as minimum volume requirements or using third-party solutions, businesses can access these lower rates. Once the account is set up, businesses can access the commercial rates for USPS shipping services and benefit from discounted prices.\\nThis makes USPS commercial rates a valuable option for a range of businesses, from small enterprises to large corporations.\\nHow Size Impacts USPS Shipping Rates\\nPackage size is another critical factor that can significantly impact shipping costs. Larger packages generally cost more to ship due to increased handling and transportation requirements.\\nDimensional weight, a concept used to calculate shipping rates for lightweight but large packages, may lead to increased shipping costs compared to actual weight.\\nConsequently, knowing how to calculate the dimensional weight and recognizing the importance of reducing package size can potentially yield considerable cost savings.\\nUnderstanding Combined Length and Girth\\nThe concept of combined length and girth is crucial in understanding the size of a package. By adding the length of the package to the total distance around its thickest part, you can calculate the combined length and girth:\\nThis measurement is used by all USPS shipping methods to determine package size, with packages exceeding a certain size potentially incurring higher rates.\\nMaximum Dimensions for Shipping\\nUnderstanding the maximum dimensions for shipping packages with USPS is crucial. Exceeding these limits may result in additional fees or service restrictions:\\nFor instance, the maximum size limit for USPS Retail Ground shipments is 130” in combined length and girth.\\nThe largest branded USPS Priority Mail box available is the Priority Mail Large Flat Rate box, which can accommodate up to 70 pounds. Being aware of these limits can help you avoid potential penalties and ensure your packages are shipped efficiently and cost-effectively.\\nThe USPS Retail Pricing Landscape\\nA clear understanding of the USPS retail pricing landscape is key to making the most cost-effective shipping decisions. USPS retail rates are the standard prices accessible to all customers at a Post Office or via USPS.com Click-N-Ship.\\nHowever, discounted rates, also known as commercial base pricing, are lower than retail rates and are offered to customers who buy and print shipping labels through online postage service providers.\\nUnderstanding the difference between these rates can assist you in finding the best prices for your shipments:\\nRetail vs. Discounted Rates\\nRetail rates are the standard prices that you would usually pay at a retail USPS counter or via USPS.com Click-N-Ship.\\nOn the other hand, discounted rates are lower than retail rates and are offered to customers who buy and print shipping labels through online postage service providers like Stamps.com.\\nThese discounted rates can provide substantial savings, particularly for businesses and frequent shippers.\\nWhere to Find Updated USPS Shipping Rates\\nFinding updated USPS shipping rates is an essential step in the process of planning for your shipping costs.\\nThe most current and updated USPS shipping rates can be obtained from the official USPS website, where USPS updates their shipping rates periodically, usually once a year. \\nYou can also access current USPS shipping rates from various reputable third-party websites like ShipStation, Pirate Ship, Easyship, and Pitney Bowes.\\nSpecialty Services and Considerations\\nBeyond the basic shipping services, the postal service, USPS, also provides specialty services and options for additional convenience and security. These include:\\nInsurance options and tracking services for packages.\\nSpecial handling for fragile or delicate items.\\nAbility to manage special delivery preferences.\\nBy leveraging these specialty services, you can add an extra layer of protection to your shipments and customize your delivery preferences to suit your specific needs.\\nInsurance and Tracking Options\\nInsurance and tracking options provided by USPS can give you peace of mind by protecting your shipments and allowing you to monitor their journey:\\nPriority Mail and USPS Ground Advantage both provide up to $100 of insurance coverage, with the option to purchase additional coverage up to $5,000, and a money back guarantee for added assurance.\\nOn the tracking front, you can access USPS tracking details for your shipment through the USPS website, mobile app, or customer service channels, enabling you to keep a close eye on your package’s location at all times.\\nSpecial Handling and Delivery Preferences\\nIf your shipments have specific requirements or need special attention, USPS has got you covered:\\nThe USPS offers a specialty service called Special Handling-Fragile, specifically tailored for shipping fragile or delicate items that need extra care.\\nThe United States Postal Service accommodates special delivery preferences through their Special Delivery Service, which allows you to customize how and where you would like your packages to be delivered.\\nLeveraging USPS Online Tools\\nUSPS online tools can significantly streamline your shipping process. These tools can simplify the shipping process, save time, and help you save money.\\nTools such as the USPS Shipping Calculator can provide you with a quick estimate of shipping costs based on package details and destination, and preparing shipments online can provide access to discounted shipping rates and save time.\\nThe Convenience of the USPS Shipping Calculator\\nThe USPS Shipping Calculator is a handy tool that lets you quickly estimate shipping costs based on package details and destination.

This allows for more cost-effective shipping options for customers.\\nSolutions\\nVirtual Mailbox\\nVirtual Business Address\\nVirtual Office Address\\nMail Forwarding\\nVirtual Mailing Address\\nLLC Address\\nTemporary Address\\nMail Scanning\\nMailbox Rental\\nPhysical Address\\nPermanent Address\\nBusiness Address\\nAlternate Address\\nVirtual Mailbox Address for Content Creators\\nCustomer Support:\\n+1 (702) 935 5664\\n+61 1800 951 410\\nOperator Support:\\n+1 (775) 500 0579\\nThe Company\\nAbout Us\\nSolutions\\nBlog\\nNewsroom\\nMarketplace\\nAffiliate Program\\nRenter Referral Program\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nMailbox Renters\\nLog In\\nRenter FAQ\\nUSPS Form 1583\\nGet a Mailbox\\nMail Center Operators\\nSign Up to be an Operator\\nOur Advantage\\nCase Studies\\nMail Center FAQ\\nLive Support:\\nMonday–Friday, 6 AM–6 PM PST\\nUSA\\nBugo LLC, 2831 St. Rose Pkwy, Suite 244, Henderson, NV 89052\\n© 2024 Bugo LLC\\nAll Rights Reserved\\nTerms & Conditions\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCookie Policy\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"JDgk1VBnXZpL1dP9AA+wkSVkTgitMtFQ76LWADfT5aE=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"15d07603-4d3a-439c-a12a-e80ae3322222":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"15d07603-4d3a-439c-a12a-e80ae3322222\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://news.usps.com/2020/06/05/right-place/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Main Navigation\\nMenu\\nNEWS\\nRight place\\nCarrier helps company get shipping deal\\nJune 5, 2020 at 10:55 a.m. ET\\nWest Columbia, SC, Letter Carrier Jamara Rozier displays a certificate she received in recognition of the sales lead she submitted.\\nA letter carrier’s keen eye has led to a sale that brought in nearly $400,000 in revenue for the Postal Service.\\nWest Columbia, SC, Letter Carrier Jamara Rozier sprang into action when she saw vehicles from USPS competitors at an auto parts dealer along her route.\\nShe talked with the business owner, who was seeking affordable shipping rates and who wanted to know if the Postal Service could offer better shipping prices for his company, which sells auto parts through several online retailers.\\nThe company’s sales have doubled since the coronavirus pandemic began, and the customer was looking for ways to reduce shipping costs and eliminate surcharges.\\nRozier submitted a lead through the Customer Connect program.

After our analysis, the bottom line is that the 2024 peak season period will be longer – and more expensive – when compared to previous years. Neither UPS or FedEx is better on pricing, with each focusing their surcharges and increases on three key areas: (1) restructuring of demand surcharges; (2) increasing demand surcharges (year-over-year); and (3) extending the demand surcharge period.\\nWhy the increase, you may ask? Is it really needed – especially as all the carriers continued to increase rates over last year? There are two primary drivers:\\nCarrier cost and capacity. Carriers assert that these peak season increases are necessary to cover the increased volume and activity that comes as a result of the holiday shopping season each year. And, as some have indicated when rolling out this year’s increases, the calendar happens to make for a compressed holiday season this year, meaning that there will be a massive increase in volume in a shorter-than-usual time period. This puts a strain on the carriers’ resources, which need to be able to ramp up (and down again) quickly, and costs them more money.\\nEconomic conditions are not as healthy for carriers as they were last year, and these changes appear to be aimed at improving the financial health of these companies at the expense of the shipper.\\nDespite the higher costs, one advantage for shippers is the carriers have announced peak rates a bit earlier this year, which can benefit shippers by giving them a window to negotiate discounts.\\nHere’s some of the details on each peak season increase, and where to go for more information:\\nUPS\\nThe “additional handling” fee has increased to $7.75 per package from last year’s peak season fee of $6.90 per package. But that’s only between Sept. 29th and Nov. 23rd. In the real crunch time – Nov. 24th to Dec. 28th, the charge will be a whopping $9.95 per package.\\nLarge package or oversize package charges have also increased dramatically for the second year in a row, going from $74.90 in peak 2023, to $84.75 or $99 this year.\\nThe fee for packages that are over the stated maximums has increased from $410 last year, to $445 or $495 per package this year.\\nVisit https://www.ups.com/assets/resources/webcontent/en_US/PeakDemandSurcharges_US.pdf for full details.\\nFedEx\\nPeak season begins Sept. 30 and runs to Nov. 24, 2024, and will then increase again for the dates of Nov. 25 to Dec. 29, 2024, before returning to the earlier peak increase until Jan. 19, 2025.\\nThe “additional handling” charge for U.S. Express Package Services, U.S. Ground Services, and International Ground Service will increase from $3.45 per package, to $7.75 to $10 a package, depending on timing. Last year the increase was to $6.95 per package.\\nThe “oversize” charge for the peak season increases this year from $73 last year to $84.50 to $100 per package depending on timing.\\nVisit https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/rate-changes/demand-surcharges.html for the full details.\\nDHL\\nDomestic shipping in the Americas will see a $50 per package increase, but international rates vary greatly.\\nTheir peak season runs from Sept. 15th to Jan. 31st.\\nCheck out https://mydhl.express.dhl/jp/en/ship/surcharges/demand-surcharge.html for full details.\\nUSPS\\nPeak surcharges resumed after a brief pause in 2023.\\nPeak season will run from October 6 and remain in place through January 18th, 2025\\nCharges are Service, Zone, and weight dependent.\\nVisit https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2024/0905-usps-proposes-temporary-rate-changes-for-2024-holiday-shipping-season.pdf for full Details.\\nThe 2024 peak surcharge situation highlights why, if you’re a company that relies on shipping, it is so important to have accurate, up-to-date visibility into exactly what your shipping expenses are, so you can optimize every factor that impacts your costs – from type of delivery, to package size and zone, to even which carrier you work with.

Read\\nGive your business a boost with a few helpful tips on categorization, minimum threshold limits and stock check cycles.\\nShare this article on LinkedIn\\nShare this article on Twitter\\nShare this article on Facebook\\nEmail a link to this article\\nCopy this link to clipboard\\nWhile strong sales are the backbone of a retail or e-commerce business, inventory management can mean the difference between success or failure. Mismanaging your inventory can lead to errors in stock levels, poor quality control and wasted storage space. These problems can quickly percolate and affect your shipping operations; they can slow picking and packing, even cause you to ship incorrect or damaged goods. Keep your business on track by implementing a few important best practices for inventory management.\\n1. Categorize Your Inventory\\nBring order to your warehouse and add efficiency to your picking process by choosing a way to categorize your products. This will make it easier and faster for you to locate and pull items from your shelves. There are a few common systems companies use. One is called ABC, which groups products by their value, with A being the most valuable items and C being the least valuable. A numerical system takes a different approach by allotting numbers for product classes, individual products and their location in the storage facility.\\n2. Establish Minimum Stock Threshold Limits\\nThe minimum stock threshold is the least amount of inventory you need on your shelves at all times. By determining your threshold limits, you can ensure you have safety stock ready to answer a sudden influx of sales. This allows you to meet demand and curb lengthy fulfillment times, which would only upset customers.\\nUse this formula to calculate your limits:\\nMinimum Stock Level = Reorder Level – (Normal Consumption Per Day or Per Week x Normal Delivery Time)\\n[1]\\n3. Implement Frequent Quality Control Checks\\nKeeping an eye on your product quality can help prevent customer satisfaction issues and lower return rates. By keeping returns down, your company can maintain its margins. Do routine checks of your inventory to search for signs of damage. Look for discrepancies in prices and product descriptions; product sizes, colors and styles should be accurate. That way you catch any issues before they hit your customer’s front door.\\n4. Implement Stock Check Cycles\\nCycle counting programs help you gauge the accuracy of your inventory levels by auditing a small sample of products on a routine basis. That way, you don’t need to spend time checking all your inventory all the time. Decide how often you’d like to do cycle counts. Some businesses take a periodic weekly or monthly approach, others do it randomly throughout the year.\\nSurges in panic buying during recent times of uncertainty have wreaked havoc on stock levels. Shippers say forward thinking and honest communication with their customers have helped tremendously.\\n[2]\\nBut routine double-checking can also help mitigate this issue. Stay vigilant about your inventory counts to maintain stock visibility. Without accurate stock information, your customers could place orders that can’t be filled.\\n5. Liquidate Slow-Moving Stock\\nBy doing routine checks of your inventory, you can stay abreast of product sell-through rates. Save your company dollars and storage space by liquidating the products that aren’t moving off the shelves. Bring new products into the fold with similar characteristics to your biggest sellers.\\n6. Build a More Robust Technology Stack\\nWith today’s stresses on the supply chain, it’s never been more important to have a unified, real-time view across all aspects of your inventory. Upgrading to modern inventory visibility tools can ensure greater accuracy, improve logistics efficiency and save on costs—ultimately enhancing the customer experience.\\n[3]\\nKey Takeaway\\nWith a few simple steps, any size business can elevate its inventory process. By categorizing your inventory, deciding minimum threshold limits, upgrading inventory visibility tools, and more, your business could see a wide range of positive effects. With a well-run management process, you could add efficiencies to your shipping operations, shorten fulfillment times, lower return rates, improve your customer service and, of course, boost your bottom line.\\nkeyboard_arrow_down\\n[1]\\nTrue Tamplin, BSc, CEPF®, “Minimum Stock Level: Definition and Explanation ” Finance Strategists, Sept. 17, 2021. arrow_right_alt\\n[2]\\nSurvey sample from “National Survey of U.S. Expedited Cargo,” The Colography Group, May–June 2021. arrow_right_alt\\nBest Practices\\nE-Commerce\\nInventory Management\\nSupply Chain\\nRELATED CONTENT\\nLogistics Management\\nA Brief Guide to Inventory Management\\nEfficient inventory management begins with knowing what you have and where to put it.

This post outlines the steps to ship a package USPS and some of the most popular USPS package shipping services.\\nShould eCommerce companies ship packages via USPS?\\nMost online retailers set up accounts with FedEx or UPS for eCommerce shipping rather than shipping packages via USPS. But, while it’s true FedEx and UPS have more flexibility to ship large boxes, and their shipping rates tend to be lower, USPS is an excellent option. ECommerce businesses shouldn’t rule out sending orders, especially small packages, by mail because sometimes the Post Office is the cheapest shipping method.\\nHere are just a few of the benefits when you ship a package USPS:\\nFaster cross-country delivery: USPS Priority Mail takes just one to three days, even for packages traveling across the U.S. Meanwhile, FedEx or UPS ground services can take as much as five days.\\nFree packaging: You can get USPS Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express shipping supplies, including flat-rate envelopes and boxes, for free.\\nFlat rate shipping: USPS offers several flat-rate shipping options, which can save you money when you ship heavy items.\\nShipping discounts even for small shippers: Even without a business account, you can save money when you ship a package via USPS Click-N-Ship.\\nHow to ship a package USPS\\nWhen you’ve chosen your USPS service and you’re ready to ship your package, the steps for how to ship a package USPS are straightforward.\\nChoose a box or envelope. Packing a box for the Postal Service is like packing any other order. Make sure your package is made of strong enough cardboard to protect the items inside. For heavy or fragile items, choose a thicker grade of corrugated cardboard; lightweight items can ship in a lighter box or even an envelope. You can choose from a range of USPS packaging when you ship via USPS Priority Mail or Priority Mail Express. Pro tip: Use standard box sizes whenever possible. USPS may charge extra for items that must be hand-processed.\\nCalculate postage. You can easily do this with the USPS postage calculator. If you aren’t using a flat-rate box or envelope, it’s critical to measure your box dimensions accurately and enter the correct weight. If you send a package with insufficient postage, USPS will return it to you or charge the recipient the difference. If you’re unsure about postage, take your package to your local Post Office counter and have them calculate it.\\nLabel your box. For Priority or Express services, you can create a USPS shipping label online through usps.com and print at home. Make sure your label is clear and readable. If your box is repurposed, be sure to remove any other labels, stickers, or barcodes attached to it.\\nSend your package. For some USPS services, you can request a package pickup. You can also drop off your package at the Post Office or in a mailbox (if it fits). Pro tip: Use online services to buy your postage ahead of time, and you can skip the line and drop your box at the counter. \\nHow to ship a package USPS: Services\\nUSPS has a range of mail services depending on the delivery speed you need and your price point for shipping. Here are some of the most popular options for eCommerce shipping.\\nPriority Mail\\nYou can mail anything from a small envelope to a large box by Priority Mail. Priority Mail flat-rate shipping is a popular delivery service because you don’t have to weigh your box; if it fits, USPS will ship it. Priority Mail delivers in one to three days, which can beat the delivery times for FedEx and UPS, so it’s a popular option for eCommerce shipping. A small flat-rate box costs $8.55 for commercial customers and $10.20 when you pay at your local Post Office.\\nPriority Mail Express \\nPriority Mail Express offers next-day and 2-day service, with flat-rate shipping options. Retail prices start at $28.75, and you can schedule a package pickup.\\nFirst-Class Mail\\nThe old-fashioned way to send a letter or package is first-class mail. To ship a package USPS First-Class Mail, you can weigh it and add postage stamps to cover the cost. Delivery time for packages is two to five business days. First-Class is only for packages that weigh 13 oz or less; you must send anything heavier by Priority Mail.\\nMedia Mail \\nUSPS will only accept certain items for Media Mail, including books, manuscripts, film, and video. The service is slower than other types of mail (two to eight days), but Media Mail is one of the cheapest ways to ship media items.\\nExtra services from USPS\\nUSPS offers a range of extra services including:\\nShipping insurance\\nCertified Mail\\nCertificate of Mailing\\nBusiness discounts for how to ship a package USPS\\nIf you use USPS for order fulfillment, you can get volume discounts on shipping services. Here are three ways to save money when you ship a package USPS.\\nClick-N-Ship\\nYou don’t need a business account to use Click-N-Ship. Anyone can set up a portal and print labels for Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express shipping. When you use the Click-N-Ship portal and print your own labels, you pay a lower price than you would to ship the same package at the Post Office. Small businesses with a low volume of shipments can instantly benefit from this accessible service.\\nClick-N-Ship Business Pro\\nThe Business Pro option gives you access to software and the ability to schedule recurring shipments.\\nBusiness Customer Gateway\\nTo use USPS business services like Click-N-Ship Business Pro, you need to create a Business Customer Gateway (BCG) account. BCG gives you access to premium services not available to retail Postal Service customers, as well as discounted commercial pricing.\\nRed Stag Fulfillment gives you choice in shipping services\\nYour eCommerce business should choose the best delivery service for each package you send. That might mean using a range of delivery options to optimize delivery times and reduce shipping costs. Red Stag Fulfillment offers its clients flexible carrier selection.\\nWe have also negotiated discounts on shipping services that we pass on to our clients, including reduced dimensional weight charges.

Each of the big three carriers – UPS, USPS, and FedEx – move millions of packages daily. Though relatively new, e- commerce is growing at unfathomable speeds as customers rely more-and-more on online shopping. With increase in demand for shipping comes increasing demands on shipping. As the Wall Street Journal reports:\\nIn its latest survey of over 1,000 U.S. consumers, supply chain consulting firm AlixPartners LLP found that consumers expect to wait an average of 4.8 days for delivery, down from 5.5 days in 2012. And the share of those who are willing to wait more than five days has declined to 60% from\\n74% in four years.\\nCustomers increasingly want more for less from online vendors. Free shipping is a major selling point for consumers, driving up your operating expenses. Combine this with increasing rates charged by carriers, it can get a little taxing for vendors. It’s also clear that annual price hikes are part of the norm, with all three carriers raising their rates in 2018.\\nMaking sense of carrier rates requires an understanding of each company and their offerings. So who are the three big competitors vying for your traffic?\\nFedEx\\nFedEx is the newest, and smallest, of the three major carriers. Founded in the 1970s by Fred Smith, the company was created with the express intent of being a technologically advanced carrier service. Despite their size, their leading edge truly is innovation. In 1979, for example, they introduced the tracking number to delivery. In terms of raw numbers, however, their performance is still behind the other two carriers with an average daily volume of 6 million, and a fleet size of 90,000 – smaller than UPS’s fleet of 119,000 vehicles. As an air carrier, however, they’re larger than UPS with 664 aircraft compared to 244 owned, and 320 leased by UPS.\\nUPS\\nThe second oldest of the three carriers, UPS was founded in 1907 in Atlanta. UPS delivers to over 220 countries and territories – essentially everywhere in the world, give or take a few locations. Daily global deliveries are over 20 million packages. In 2015 UPS was the leading carrier of online deliveries. Despite their smaller fleet and revenue compared to USPS, UPS is very much a competitive figure on the market.\\nUSPS\\nThe United States Postal Service, USPS, is an old dog in the carrier kennel. Founded in 1775, there’s a lot of ink spilled on a daily basis about how it’s an antiquated relic, hemorrhaging money, and doomed to fail. Beyond the doom and gloom, though, it’s pretty clear that USPS is doing just fine as a competitor. A 10-year perspective reveals that, despite the 2008 economic crash, the agency has maintained a relatively constant revenue stream, with 2017 bringing in $69.6 billion – more than UPS at $66 billion.\\nComparing Rates\\nSo now to the important part: prices. Obviously, pricing depends on what you’re shipping, where it’s going, and when it needs to arrive. That said, what does the price look like if you wanted to ship a 6 x 6 x 4 inch, 12 oz package from Tennessee to Texas? Let's compare shipping rates:\\nFedEx Home Delivery– $13.85\\nUPS Ground - $10.72\\nUSPS First-Class Package Service - $3.82\\nThat’s pretty shocking, to say the least. When we compare shipping prices, USPS comes out to be $3.82, one third the price of the next-best price from UPS.\\nNumbers vary, however, and USPS has its own restrictions on weight that aren’t quite as flexible as the other two carriers. USPS, for example, has a weight restriction of 70 lbs. for most deliveries.\\nLet’s look at another scenario and compare shipping costs. You have a 65-pound package, 12 x 12 x 10 inches, and you want to ship from Atlanta to Salt Lake City. What do the prices look like on that order?\\nFedEx Home Delivery - $94.29\\nUPS Ground - $96.10\\nUSPS Priority Mail – $99.54\\nNot a lot of variation, but FedEx comes out as the winner here.\\nThe takeaway is not that one company is always better than the others. For any specific package that needs shipping, there are many factors that affect your price. For lightweight packages, USPS tends to be the cheapest way to ship a package. For heavier packages, however, they’re not always your best option. FedEx and UPS tend to have higher average prices, but their services focus on specific types of packages and delivery. Picking your carrier requires knowledge and research; don’t take it lightly.\\nSources:\\nwww.prestashop.com/en/blog/comparing-3-major-shipping-carriers-ups-vs-fedex-vs-usps\\nabout.van.fedex.com/our-story/company-structure/express-fact-sheet/\\nfacts.usps.com/table-facts/\\nintegracore-587098.hs-sites.com/packaging/10-facts-that-may-not-know-about-fedex/\\nwww.wsj.com/articles/online-shoppers-want-delivery-faster-cheaper-survey-shows-1465851072\\nContact Us For More\\nGeneral Inquiries: 888-993-8594\\nCustomer Support: support@firstmile.com\\nSales & Partnerships: shipping@firstmile.com\\nCareers: recruiting@firstmile.com\\nPackage Tracking\\nContact Us\\nGet Ready to Transform Your Shipping Experience\\nComplete the form and our shipping team will reach out to discuss the best plan forward to meet your operational needs.\\nFEATURED BLOG POSTS\\nStay Up To Date on Recent Posts\\nImmediate Changes to Pitney Bowes GeC Services\\nRead More\\nFirstMile Recognized as an Innovator by Stampli\\nRead More\\nWho Has the Cheapest Shipping Rates: UPS, USPS, FedEx, or DHL?\\nRead More\\nA Comprehensive Guide to Shipping Heavy Items with the Cheapest Carrier Rates\\nRead More\\nWhat is a Courier Service?

Reduce Shipping Costs – Effective Ways and Advice from Entrepreneurs\\nAbdul Rehman Updated on July 6, 2021 10 Min Read\\nYour shipping costs significantly affects your company’s profitability.Most carriers tend to revise their rates on a yearly basis.Because demand in the ecommerce industry has increased considerably over the past few years, carriers also need to adjust their rates based on factors ranging from the amount of warehousing space they have available to the distance to be covered in transit.Learning how to reduce shipping costs is incredibly important for your business.Larger corporations like Amazon use free shipping virtually all over the globe to make it harder for the average business owner to compete by offering free shipping virtually all over the globe on pricing.Low shipping costs are therefore a key tool in your arsenal to improve your margins.Unfortunately, this is much easier said than done.There are plenty of factors that affect your shipping costs.For instance, you need to be very careful about the kind of packaging that you use.More importantly, you will also have to conduct careful research in order to figure out which shipping carrier is best suited to your needs.Table of Contents\\n10 Ways to Reduce Shipping Costs\\nNegotiate with Several Carriers\\nWeigh Packages and Shave Dimensions\\nUse Packages Given by Your Carrier\\nLook

Entrepreneurs Cut Down on Shipping Costs\\nIs Outsourcing Fulfillment a Good Idea?There are plenty of different ways by which you can reduce your costs of shipping.Learning how to reduce shipping costs could allow you to generate higher profits.Ultimately the money you save could be better utilized in advancing your business.But how can you reduce your shipping costs?Read on to find out.10 Ways to Reduce Shipping Costs\\nHere are some of the most effective ways that may reduce your average shipping cost.1.Negotiate with Several Carriers\\nToo many businesses stick with the first shipping carrier that they come across.Obviously, that’s a bad idea.Virtually all shipping carriers change their pricing based on volume.The higher the volume, the lower the price.Unfortunately, many small businesses fail to realize that they have a bit of wiggle room when negotiating the price.Visit the offices of a few local carriers, or talk to them over the phone.Familiarize yourself with factors like the size and weight of your package, as well as its origin and destination, and use this information to get a better bargain.Some also offer ecommerce payment processing as a package deal, so you may want to look into that.2.Weigh Packages and Shave Dimensions\\nHeavier packages generally cost more to ship unless you have opted for flat-rate shipping.If you are printing the labels and shipping everything from your garage or a shop, you might want to consider buying a postage scale.This will give you a better idea about the weight of each package, and allow you to calculate the costs more accurately.You should also try to reduce the dimensions of the package as much as possible.Some companies charge more depending upon the size of the box.If the item is lightweight, there’s no reason to pack it in a big box.Use smaller ones, and you can save a significant amount.3.Use Packages Given by Your Carrier\\nOne of the best ways to reduce shipping costs is to only use the boxes and packaging provided by your carrier.Most carriers like FedEx and UPS charge a dimensional fee if you use your own boxes.It might help with branding, but unless you can afford to incur an extra charge on each package shipped, you should definitely consider using the ecommerce packaging provided by the carrier.4.Look for Discounted Supplies\\nLarger shipping carriers like UPS and FedEx often provide discounted or even free packaging supplies to small business owners.Packaging material like bubble wrap, poly mailers, and dunnage can be purchased in bulk quantities, which will result in additional cost savings for your business.5.Pay for Shipping Online\\nThis might come as a surprise to most people, but you can save up to 16 percent on priority mail orders via USPS by simply paying for shipping online.This figure can go all the way to 60 percent for express shipping, which can be a significant amount when you consider the number of packages shipped each month.On top of that, you also get a free pick-up!6.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"izNiN4Ue700/AwqtS4HVrrasZFKwPR9FMvuFAsQ5AjY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"877e54de-e162-4741-9ec4-5656b8d44683":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"877e54de-e162-4741-9ec4-5656b8d44683\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"cdaf51b0-4408-4d6f-955c-5e984c612176\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"jpVz8SXYssk5fD/dmFGSHsXQ9Z/mKONMd1xulOCiPGM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"707cb7c6-619e-42d3-96f1-161de4f9f401\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"izNiN4Ue700/AwqtS4HVrrasZFKwPR9FMvuFAsQ5AjY=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"9156d540-9217-429a-9d55-0ed4cb3b9ee2\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"uu39Y4j1t2O5nY06exYP4euKzgEQTY0Wwr8HTDmX3rk=\"}},\"text\":\"Most

pick-up!6.Choose Prepaid Shipping\\nPrepaid shipping offers a discount of up to 20 percent.What this means is that you buy a bunch of shipping labels and put them on packages when they are going to be shipped out, instead of paying for each when you have to ship it.This is the ideal choice for people who know that same weight packages will be shipped out again and again from their company.7.Use Third Party Insurance\\nShipping insurance can put a serious dent in your profit margins, especially for valuable goods.Most people usually opt for insurance from the shipping company only, but opting for a third party could net you significant savings.It’s usually cheaper than the one your shipping company is going to offer.8.Be Accurate with Billing\\nThere are a whole host of different shipping charges that might be levied on the product, so you need to factor in all of them when billing your customers.If your customer is paying for shipping, send them an accurate estimate so that you don’t have to absorb them.9.Choose Hybrid Services\\nIn certain situations, hybrid services that are offered by logistics companies like UPS and FedEx might be cheaper.These services are generally cheaper, and they will also pick up the packages and ship them to the post office closest to the destination.They do cost less, but you should know that the delivery time is also slower.But, this is a great way to reduce shipping costs.10.Opt for Poly Mailers\\nIf you have to ship non-fragile goods like clothes, you might want to consider using poly mailers instead of boxes.Poly mailers are cheap because they take up less space and reduce packaging costs.Conventional tape can be used for sealing the poly bags.Most people don’t think about it, but you also have to focus on reducing your page load times as much as possible.This will boost orders and improve revenue, so make sure you choose a reliable web store host.Cloudways Gives You a Range of Tools like a Profit Margin Calculator to Help Streamline Costs\\nUse these tools to gain an edge over the competition.CHECK NOW!How Other Entrepreneurs Cut Down on Shipping Costs\\nWe have discussed the best ways to bring down shipping costs.In this section, we shall focus on advice from other entrepreneurs, and the steps they take to reduce shipping costs.1.Partner with a Fulfillment Center\\nCalloway Cook, the President of Illuminate Labs, says that you should partner with a fulfillment center.When you get a 3PL partner, they can negotiate significantly lower shipping rates with all major carriers (both domestic and international) because of their shipping volume.Our current shipping rates are about 30% lower than retail rates thanks to our fulfillment partner company.The other way that a fulfillment partner helps to reduce shipping costs, is by separating your inventory in different warehouses across the country.This allows orders to ship from the closest warehouse, which reduces cost significantly.2.Akram Tariq Khan, Yourlibaas.com\\nAkram Tariq Khan at Yourlibaas.com says it’s best to partner with companies that have similar shipping accounts.We ship over 400 packets daily internationally, primarily within India.The strategies we have adopted are:\\nPartnered with multiple shipping aggregators and courier partners.We have developed a PHP script in-house which requests for quotes from all providers while creating shipping labels and sends shipping requests to the one with the lowest quote.As courier companies have high surcharges for services like Cash on Delivery, we incentivise users who make online prepaid payments.This results in both shipping costs being reduced and also a reduction in RTO (Return to Origin) shipments.RTO shipments are the ones that aren’t delivered to the receiver due to any reason.Reduce the volume of the shipment to reduce volumetric weight.Apart from the actual weight in kilograms/lbs, the courier providers also consider the volume of the package.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"9/q6/R5B09SdGbYdzgEqkosjWoVYzanJc0Ss1RXqFpE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9156d540-9217-429a-9d55-0ed4cb3b9ee2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9156d540-9217-429a-9d55-0ed4cb3b9ee2\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"cdaf51b0-4408-4d6f-955c-5e984c612176\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"jpVz8SXYssk5fD/dmFGSHsXQ9Z/mKONMd1xulOCiPGM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"877e54de-e162-4741-9ec4-5656b8d44683\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"mp43XOj9Xrk7/7uAbU0J5WagWzuFMyNd9X4dohUNigI=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"08ad46f8-f7c4-44f0-8472-1afca67b66ba\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"2iperuW8kUQfSB/wJGH3sWiF9hxvK3HBmblD53uqNyY=\"}},\"text\":\"Akram

destination.Opting for a faster air delivery would only result in higher charges while the service will be the same.These decisions are made by the script which calculates the distance between the customer’s ZIP code and our warehouse.It can also be done manually for stores with low volume.Want to Learn More About Shipping Costs?Read our comprehensive ecommerce shipping guide.I agree to the

Shipping Easy, which connects to our Woocommerce website and lets us compare shops to determine which size of box or padded envelope will be cheapest to ship each order in.This means we need to have a variety of different sized boxes and padded envelopes on hand.We always have the typical USPS packages/boxes, but we also purchase our own differently sized boxes and envelopes, so we can choose the cheapest rate possible (we happen to buy our boxes/envelopes through Royal Mailers and Uline, but there’s a lot of options out there).This results in big savings.For example, we’re based in Louisville, KY.If we were to ship spices to a Californian customer via priority mail in our own packaging, it would cost something like $13, but Shipping Easy tells us if we do it via USPS’s own priority packaging, it’s closer to $7.75, a huge savings.Other times, it’s cheaper to use our own packaging; it all depends on the weight and which region it’s shipping to.We’ve also learned using USPS regional A and B boxes are key to getting lower rates.These aren’t available at the local post office – you have to order them online at USPS.com.These bring big savings (40-60%) when we’re shipping packages shorter distances, let’s say to Illinois or Tennessee.That alone can save us $5-7 per order.As you can see, we primarily use USPS, but there is an exception.If we have a package that weighs over 5 pounds, we turn to UPS, which typically has better rates for higher-weight packages.4.Focus on Reducing Returns\\nDavid DeCorte of Chargebacks911 says, “you can cut shipping costs considerably and encourage customer loyalty by reducing returns.Four out of five customers see free shipping as a plus when deciding whether or not to complete a purchase, and nearly half of all eCommerce businesses now offer it.Free return shipping can be unrealistic, though, if you don’t address the common reasons why buyers request returns.For instance, buyers often justify returns by saying that the products received are incorrect, or that they don’t match the images or description.An item might be bigger or smaller than expected, or be the wrong color.But, by having detailed product descriptions, accuracy during the fulfillment process, and having a clear and comprehensive return policy listed on the site, a merchant can prevent these losses.This will have additional, knock-on effects, too.For instance, fewer returns mean a lower overhead and more savings over time.Plus, many of the triggers that can cause a return are also related to chargebacks, which are even more costly.5.Use a Big Company Like FedEx\\nJennifer Mayne of Dorothy Lane Market says, “we ship our great brownies, baked goods and gourmet food gifts all over the country.Many of our gifts and food items are perishable so we spend a lot on shipping.We work closely with FedEx to get our shipping fees lowered.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"5YunwaCV3IkC+wh2+1KJO/ccgDPMHo0jJsZc6izwLu0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"08ad46f8-f7c4-44f0-8472-1afca67b66ba":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"08ad46f8-f7c4-44f0-8472-1afca67b66ba\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"cdaf51b0-4408-4d6f-955c-5e984c612176\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"jpVz8SXYssk5fD/dmFGSHsXQ9Z/mKONMd1xulOCiPGM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9156d540-9217-429a-9d55-0ed4cb3b9ee2\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"uu39Y4j1t2O5nY06exYP4euKzgEQTY0Wwr8HTDmX3rk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"5562dbb0-1490-4dfa-8f59-886d71d1dc18\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"YWos85E+/Y8LB4zk1QgEvqKoVQkkkEuczlbwN/2fsKA=\"}},\"text\":\"For

the country.Many of our gifts and food items are perishable so we spend a lot on shipping.We work closely with FedEx to get our shipping fees lowered.Here are some of the suggestions they have given us and have implemented with success in reducing our costs: Fedex provides reports on the actual weight of each package versus the dimensional weight of each package that we ship.We carefully analyze the report to capture savings.FedEx charges for dimensional weight, so larger boxes cost more.At times we send two smaller boxes as opposed to one very large box due to higher fees for larger dimensional weight.They have done an analysis of our gift boxes to help us figure out less expensive sized boxes to use.We try to select our food items that go into the gift boxes that have been predetermined as more efficient.It doesn’t always work out, but that is our goal.We also are taking advantage of their new service to do ground delivery on Saturdays.This allows us to use ground more often toward the end of the week if we do not need a guarantee arrival date and the packages are not too perishable.I think once the weather cools down, we will take advantage of this more.Right now with the heat wave in many parts of the country, we have to use a lot of ice and prefer to ship Monday to Wednesday.But when the weather is cooler, we can let shipments go to be delivered on the weekend now.Is Outsourcing Fulfillment a Good Idea?One of the things that you might have to consider is whether to outsource fulfillment or keep it in house.There’s little doubt that outsourcing fulfillment is going to save you a considerable amount of money on shipping and improve delivery times .But there’s a downside to this as well.When you outsource fulfillment, you won’t have any control over operations or inventory.You won’t be able to decide how much to store, what to package, and what to ship your products.More importantly, you won’t have any control over the facilities or the team working in the warehouse.In the beginning, most businesses prefer to outsource fulfillment because it offers greater cost savings.If you want to outsource to a fulfillment center, you need to evaluate your options considerably.For example, you can hire Los Angeles fulfillment services to cater to your customers in LA.Carefully calculate the cost savings, and then determine whether the trade-off is worth it or not.Outsourcing is ideal for smaller businesses that want to register rapid growth.Once you can afford to spend enough on shipping, you should consider setting up your own fulfillment center.Conclusion\\nMany business owners are confused about how to reduce shipping costs.In this article, we have covered multiple strategies that will help you reduce shipping costs by a significant margin, and allow you to focus on business growth.At the end of the day, you need to create a balance and find what works best for your business.More importantly, you should know that shipping costs are dynamic, and you will have to revise your estimations from time to time.FAQs\\nQ1.What is the cheapest shipping method?UPS First class mail is the cheapest shipping method if your

The Complete USPS Shipping Rates by Weight Chart\\nby Shay Discepolo\\nFebruary 12, 2024 | 10 min read\\nLooking for current USPS shipping rates based on weight?Our no-frills guide presents a clear USPS shipping rates by weight chart to quickly determine your shipping costs.You’ll also find essential insights on how weight influences USPS shipping, ensuring you make informed decisions before sending out your packages.Key Takeaways\\nUSPS shipping rates are determined by weight, dimensions, and destination, with heavier and larger packages generally costing more.The maximum weight for domestic packages is 70 pounds.USPS offers a variety of shipping options suited for different needs, including First Class Package Service for items up to 13 ounces, and Priority Mail services for faster delivery of heavier packages up to 70 pounds.To save on shipping costs, USPS provides Flat Rate shipping for packages up to 70 pounds and offers commercial prices with discounts of up to 28% for customers who meet certain criteria, such as volume requirements.Understanding USPS Shipping Costs by Weight\\nKnowledge of USPS shipping costs is vital whether you’re an individual sending a package to a loved one or a business owner shipping products to customers.The cost of shipping a package with USPS is primarily determined by three factors: package weight, dimensions, and destination.As a rule of thumb, heavier packages generally incur higher shipping costs, and the size of the package can also affect the cost due to increased handling and transportation requirements.Shipping costs also rise with the distance the package needs to travel, due to increased transportation and handling charges.Package Weight Breakdown\\nWithin USPS shipping, the package’s weight significantly influences the cost.The shipping costs increase as the weight of the package increases, showing a direct proportionality between the two.Heavier packages result in higher shipping expenses.The USPS has established several weight categories for shipping, and the maximum weight limit for domestic packages is 70 pounds.It’s important to note that lower maximum weight standards may apply to APOs, FPOs, and DPOs.Understanding this system is key to evade surplus weight charges and choose the suitable shipping service.Determining Your Package’s Weight\\nTo avoid unexpected shipping fees and ensure correct postage, it’s vital to accurately measure your package’s weight.The recommended method for accurately measuring package weight for USPS shipment is to use a postal scale, which provides precise measurements for accurate postage calculation.However, in the absence of a postal scale, you can use alternative methods such as a bathroom scale or a kitchen scale.Weight Limits and Overweight Packages\\nBesides weight measurement, it’s important to take into account weight limits.USPS has weight limits for different shipping services, and exceeding these limits may result in additional fees or service restrictions.For example, Priority Mail allows the shipment of items weighing up to 70 pounds and measuring up to 108 inches in total length and girth.If a USPS package surpasses the maximum weight limit, it could be returned to the sender or subject to additional postage charges.Navigating USPS Shipping Options\\nUSPS provides a wide array of shipping options, each designed to meet various needs.Some of the options include:\\nFirst Class Package Service: Ideal for parcels weighing 13 ounces or less.Priority Mail: The go-to option for packages over one pound.First Class Mail: Has a weight limit of 15.99 ounces.Priority Mail: Renowned for its faster delivery, albeit at a higher cost.Depending on your specific needs, you can choose from a range of options that offer varying delivery times and shipping costs between First Class Mail, Priority Mail, and Priority Mail Express.First Class Mail Service\\nFirst Class Mail Service is an affordable option for shipping lightweight packages.This service has a pricing structure based on weight and destination.For instance, the pricing details include $1.16 for 1 oz, $1.36 for 2 oz, and so on, up to the weight limit of 15.99 ounces.While tracking is not provided for small-sized items such as postcards, letters, and flats, it is available for First-Class Package Services at no extra cost, ensuring you can keep tabs on your shipment’s journey.Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express\\nIf speed is of the essence, Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express are the options to consider.USPS Priority Mail typically delivers within 1-3 business days, while Priority Mail Express offers next-day to 2-day delivery for most destinations.The latter is the most efficient option for ensuring overnight delivery.Both these services accept packages up to 70 lbs, making them a versatile choice for a wide range of shipping needs.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"uUek+tQrmLBKuWj4/KBc9o3pd+uUzgioiAJdQeBbK5w=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"abaa4382-18b7-42c6-8bea-700a5bf5f727":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"abaa4382-18b7-42c6-8bea-700a5bf5f727\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.anytimemailbox.com/blog/usps-shipping-rates-by-weight-chart\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"d541b46f-5aa7-4de6-88da-15418551b535\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.anytimemailbox.com/blog/usps-shipping-rates-by-weight-chart\"},\"hash\":\"JDgk1VBnXZpL1dP9AA+wkSVkTgitMtFQ76LWADfT5aE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a12cad26-8a42-4b22-b928-f6bfbcfd9976\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.anytimemailbox.com/blog/usps-shipping-rates-by-weight-chart\"},\"hash\":\"uUek+tQrmLBKuWj4/KBc9o3pd+uUzgioiAJdQeBbK5w=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"8fd78f2f-d6cf-49cb-ae01-68afe57bc312\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"VR0cuJmKN9UuYlBDsVXK2AluLvW+hspQ1mZrNsV4WSM=\"}},\"text\":\"This

packages up to 70 lbs, making them a versatile choice for a wide range of shipping needs.Maximizing Savings with USPS Flat Rate and Commercial Prices\\nWhen it comes to shipping, cost-effectiveness is a primary concern, and USPS addresses this with its Flat Rate and Commercial Prices.The Priority Mail Flat Rate service offers a fixed-rate option for sending packages weighing up to 70 pounds, eliminating the need to weigh each package individually.This service is particularly advantageous for heavier packages that would otherwise incur higher shipping costs based on their weight.On the other hand, commercial prices provide discounts of up to 28% off retail prices, presenting potential savings for businesses and frequent shippers compared to domestic prices.Priority Mail Flat Rate Solutions\\nPriority Mail Flat Rate solutions offer a single rate regardless of weight, making them a cost-effective option for heavier shipments.These include Flat Rate Envelopes and Flat Rate Boxes, which are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate different shipping needs.The costs of these options vary depending on the chosen packaging, with prices ranging from $9.20 for Small Flat Rate Boxes and from $14.75 to $17.10 for Medium Flat Rate Boxes.Bear in mind that prices could change and might vary based on location and shipping method.Accessing Lower Commercial Rates\\nLower commercial rates can offer extra savings for businesses.By meeting specific criteria such as minimum volume requirements or using third-party solutions, businesses can access these lower rates.Once the account is set up, businesses can access the commercial rates for USPS shipping services and benefit from discounted prices.This makes USPS commercial rates a valuable option for a range of businesses, from small enterprises to large corporations.How Size Impacts USPS Shipping Rates\\nPackage size is another critical factor that can significantly impact shipping costs.Larger packages generally cost more to ship due to increased handling and transportation requirements.Dimensional weight, a concept used to calculate shipping rates for lightweight but large packages, may lead to increased shipping costs compared to actual weight.Consequently, knowing how to calculate the dimensional weight and recognizing the importance of reducing package size can potentially yield considerable cost savings.Understanding Combined Length and Girth\\nThe concept of combined length and girth is crucial in understanding the size of a package.By adding the length of the package to the total distance around its thickest part, you can calculate the combined length and girth:\\nThis measurement is used by all USPS shipping methods to determine package size, with packages exceeding a certain size potentially incurring higher rates.Maximum Dimensions for Shipping\\nUnderstanding the maximum dimensions for shipping packages with USPS is crucial.Exceeding these limits may result in additional fees or service restrictions:\\nFor instance, the maximum size limit for USPS Retail Ground shipments is 130” in combined length and girth.The largest branded USPS Priority Mail box available is the Priority Mail Large Flat Rate box, which can accommodate up to 70 pounds.Being aware of these limits can help you avoid potential penalties and ensure your packages are shipped efficiently and cost-effectively.The USPS Retail Pricing Landscape\\nA clear understanding of the USPS retail pricing landscape is key to making the most cost-effective shipping decisions.USPS retail rates are the standard prices accessible to all customers at a Post Office or via USPS.com Click-N-Ship.However, discounted rates, also known as commercial base pricing, are lower than retail rates and are offered to customers who buy and print shipping labels through online postage service providers.Understanding the difference between these rates can assist you in finding the best prices for your shipments:\\nRetail vs. Discounted Rates\\nRetail rates are the standard prices that you would usually pay at a retail USPS counter or via USPS.com Click-N-Ship.On the other hand, discounted rates are lower than retail rates and are offered to customers who buy and print shipping labels through online postage service providers like Stamps.com.These discounted rates can provide substantial savings, particularly for businesses and frequent shippers.Where to Find Updated USPS Shipping Rates\\nFinding updated USPS shipping rates is an essential step in the process of planning for your

DHL, but businesses can mitigate higher holiday shipping costs by using data-driven optimization strategies to negotiate discounts and manage carrier fees effectively.By Jack McCrum Director of Optimization Analytics for Reveel October 14, 2024\\n\\nHoliday Peak Season 2024: It’s That Time of Year Again!It’s that time of year again – the beginning of peak shipping season.After our analysis, the bottom line is that the 2024 peak season period will be longer – and more expensive – when compared to previous years.Neither UPS or FedEx is better on pricing, with each focusing their surcharges and increases on three key areas: (1) restructuring of demand surcharges; (2) increasing demand surcharges (year-over-year); and (3) extending the demand surcharge period.Why the increase, you may ask?Is it really needed – especially as all the carriers continued to increase rates over last year?There are two primary drivers:\\nCarrier cost and capacity.Carriers assert that these peak season increases are necessary to cover the increased volume and activity that comes as a result of the holiday shopping season each year.And, as some have indicated when rolling out this year’s increases, the calendar happens to make for a compressed holiday season this year, meaning that there will be a massive increase in volume in a shorter-than-usual time period.This puts a strain on the carriers’ resources, which need to be able to ramp up (and down again) quickly, and costs them more money.Economic conditions are not as healthy for carriers as they were last year, and these changes appear to be aimed at improving the financial health of these companies at the expense of the shipper.Despite the higher costs, one advantage for shippers is the carriers have announced peak rates a bit earlier this year, which can benefit shippers by giving them a window to negotiate discounts.Here’s some of the details on each peak season increase, and where to go for more information:\\nUPS\\nThe “additional handling” fee has increased to $7.75 per package from last year’s peak season fee of $6.90 per package.But that’s only between Sept.29th and Nov.23rd.In the real crunch time – Nov.24th to Dec.28th, the charge will be a whopping $9.95 per package.Large package or oversize package charges have also increased dramatically for the second year in a row, going from $74.90 in peak 2023, to $84.75 or $99 this year.The fee for packages that are over the stated maximums has increased from $410 last year, to $445 or $495 per package this year.Visit https://www.ups.com/assets/resources/webcontent/en_US/PeakDemandSurcharges_US.pdf for full details.FedEx\\nPeak season begins Sept.30 and runs to Nov.24, 2024, and will then increase again for the dates of Nov.25 to Dec.29, 2024, before returning to the earlier peak increase until Jan.19, 2025.The “additional handling” charge for U.S.Express Package Services, U.S.Ground Services, and International Ground Service will increase from $3.45 per package, to $7.75 to $10 a package, depending on timing.Last year the increase was to $6.95 per package.The “oversize” charge for the peak season increases this year from $73 last year to $84.50 to $100 per package depending on timing.Visit https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/rate-changes/demand-surcharges.html for the full details.DHL\\nDomestic shipping in the Americas will see a $50 per package increase, but international rates vary greatly.Their peak season runs from Sept.15th to Jan.31st.Check out https://mydhl.express.dhl/jp/en/ship/surcharges/demand-surcharge.html for full details.USPS\\nPeak surcharges resumed after a brief pause in 2023.Peak season will run from October 6 and remain in place through January 18th, 2025\\nCharges are Service, Zone, and weight dependent.Visit

Min.Read\\nGive your business a boost with a few helpful tips on categorization, minimum threshold limits and stock check cycles.Share this article on LinkedIn\\nShare this article on Twitter\\nShare this article on Facebook\\nEmail a link to this article\\nCopy this link to clipboard\\nWhile strong sales are the backbone of a retail or e-commerce business, inventory management can mean the difference between success or failure.Mismanaging your inventory can lead to errors in stock levels, poor quality control and wasted storage space.These problems can quickly percolate and affect your shipping operations; they can slow picking and packing, even cause you to ship incorrect or damaged goods.Keep your business on track by implementing a few important best practices for inventory management.1.Categorize Your Inventory\\nBring order to your warehouse and add efficiency to your picking process by choosing a way to categorize your products.This will make it easier and faster for you to locate and pull items from your shelves.There are a few common systems companies use.One is called ABC, which groups products by their value, with A being the most valuable items and C being the least valuable.A numerical system takes a different approach by allotting numbers for product classes, individual products and their location in the storage facility.2.Establish Minimum Stock Threshold Limits\\nThe minimum stock threshold is the least amount of inventory you need on your shelves at all times.By determining your threshold limits, you can ensure you have safety stock ready to answer a sudden influx of sales.This allows you to meet demand and curb lengthy fulfillment times, which would only upset customers.Use this formula to calculate your limits:\\nMinimum Stock Level = Reorder Level – (Normal Consumption Per Day or Per Week x Normal Delivery Time)\\n[1]\\n3.Implement Frequent Quality Control Checks\\nKeeping an eye on your product quality can help prevent customer satisfaction issues and lower return rates.By keeping returns down, your company can maintain its margins.Do routine checks of your inventory to search for signs of damage.Look for discrepancies in prices and product descriptions; product sizes, colors and styles should be accurate.That way you catch any issues before they hit your customer’s front door.4.Implement Stock Check Cycles\\nCycle counting programs help you gauge the accuracy of your inventory levels by auditing a small sample of products on a routine basis.That way, you don’t need to spend time checking all your inventory all the time.Decide how often you’d like to do cycle counts.Some businesses take a periodic weekly or monthly approach, others do it randomly throughout the year.Surges in panic buying during recent times of uncertainty have wreaked havoc on stock levels.Shippers say forward thinking and honest communication with their customers have helped tremendously.[2]\\nBut routine double-checking can also help mitigate this issue.Stay vigilant about your inventory counts to maintain stock visibility.Without accurate stock information, your customers could place orders that can’t be filled.5.Liquidate Slow-Moving Stock\\nBy doing routine checks of your inventory, you can stay abreast of product sell-through rates.Save your company dollars and storage space by liquidating the products that aren’t moving off the shelves.Bring new products into the fold with similar characteristics to your biggest sellers.6.Build a More Robust Technology Stack\\nWith today’s stresses on the supply chain, it’s never been more important to have a unified, real-time view across all aspects of your inventory.Upgrading to modern inventory visibility tools can ensure greater accuracy, improve logistics efficiency and save on costs—ultimately enhancing the customer experience.[3]\\nKey Takeaway\\nWith a few simple steps, any size business can elevate its inventory process.By categorizing your inventory, deciding minimum threshold limits, upgrading inventory visibility tools, and more, your business could see a wide range of positive effects.With a well-run management process, you could add efficiencies to your shipping operations, shorten fulfillment times, lower return rates, improve your customer service and, of course, boost your bottom line.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"46aFAGKp6anM67tyE6gK8bGUobMtOPaVjQGiovVsR9w=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6e09145e-66ec-47af-b151-19bdc0a3c6f8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6e09145e-66ec-47af-b151-19bdc0a3c6f8\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.uspsdelivers.com/6-best-practices-for-managing-your-inventory/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"f12f77ce-601d-4b94-ac39-9db8ccbe201a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.uspsdelivers.com/6-best-practices-for-managing-your-inventory/\"},\"hash\":\"396YqT7HkRScKLmOqQM2hZ5fbsphOW5qbO+sEXmFUFk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"1217fce0-260b-41cd-b502-9bb0354a0ff9\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.uspsdelivers.com/6-best-practices-for-managing-your-inventory/\"},\"hash\":\"46aFAGKp6anM67tyE6gK8bGUobMtOPaVjQGiovVsR9w=\"}},\"text\":\"Save

USPS\\nAlex Selwitz Last updated: September 27, 2024\\nIn this article:\\nShould eCommerce companies ship packages via USPS?How to ship a package USPS\\nHow to ship a package USPS: Services\\nBusiness discounts for how to ship a package USPS\\nRed Stag Fulfillment gives you choice in shipping services\\nSubscribe Now to get all things ecommerce delivered straight to your inbox.Whether you’re sending a gift to a friend or looking for good eCommerce fulfillment shipping options, knowing how to ship a package USPS is handy.This post outlines the steps to ship a package USPS and some of the most popular USPS package shipping services.Should eCommerce companies ship packages via USPS?Most online retailers set up accounts with FedEx or UPS for eCommerce shipping rather than shipping packages via USPS.But, while it’s true FedEx and UPS have more flexibility to ship large boxes, and their shipping rates tend to be lower, USPS is an excellent option.ECommerce businesses shouldn’t rule out sending orders, especially small packages, by mail because sometimes the Post Office is the cheapest shipping method.Here are just a few of the benefits when you ship a package USPS:\\nFaster cross-country delivery: USPS Priority Mail takes just one to three days, even for packages traveling across the U.S.Meanwhile, FedEx or UPS ground services can take as much as five days.Free packaging: You can get USPS Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express shipping supplies, including flat-rate envelopes and boxes, for free.Flat rate shipping: USPS offers several flat-rate shipping options, which can save you money when you ship heavy items.Shipping discounts even for small shippers: Even without a business account, you can save money when you ship a package via USPS Click-N-Ship.How to ship a package USPS\\nWhen you’ve chosen your USPS service and you’re ready to ship your package, the steps for how to ship a package USPS are straightforward.Choose a box or envelope.Packing a box for the Postal Service is like packing any other order.Make sure your package is made of strong enough cardboard to protect the items inside.For heavy or fragile items, choose a thicker grade of corrugated cardboard; lightweight items can ship in a lighter box or even an envelope.You can choose from a range of USPS packaging when you ship via USPS Priority Mail or Priority Mail Express.Pro tip: Use standard box sizes whenever possible.USPS may charge extra for items that must be hand-processed.Calculate postage.You can easily do this with the USPS postage calculator.If you aren’t using a flat-rate box or envelope, it’s critical to measure your box dimensions accurately and enter the correct weight.If you send a package with insufficient postage, USPS will return it to you or charge the recipient the difference.If you’re unsure about postage, take your package to your local Post Office counter and have them calculate it.Label your box.For Priority or Express services, you can create a USPS shipping label online through usps.com and print at home.Make sure your label is clear and readable.If your box is repurposed, be sure to remove any other labels, stickers, or barcodes attached to it.Send your package.For some USPS services, you can request a package pickup.You can also drop off your package at the Post Office or in a mailbox (if it fits).Pro tip: Use online services to buy your postage ahead of time, and you can skip the line and drop your box at the counter.How to ship a package USPS: Services\\nUSPS has a range of mail services depending on the delivery speed you need and your price point for shipping.Here are some of the most popular options for eCommerce shipping.Priority Mail\\nYou can mail anything from a small envelope to a large box by Priority Mail.Priority Mail flat-rate shipping is a popular delivery service because you don’t have to weigh your box; if it fits, USPS will ship it.Priority Mail delivers in one to three days, which can beat the delivery times for FedEx and UPS, so it’s a popular option for eCommerce shipping.A small flat-rate box costs $8.55 for commercial customers and $10.20 when you pay at your local Post Office.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"7aXVA3QrPGffM+TAaMW86DDMKLUqoCiXV9IAO5D9dPg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2d1c26ce-9c07-4935-8471-6033e294ef88":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2d1c26ce-9c07-4935-8471-6033e294ef88\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://redstagfulfillment.com/how-to-ship-a-package-usps/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"2f36b23a-7b3d-45ec-a62a-319c88b0b70a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://redstagfulfillment.com/how-to-ship-a-package-usps/\"},\"hash\":\"6/cR984JiXGY9vwGI4ZuV/xJn4R8kgNetMob+ok0oqI=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"71563ab5-42de-4e8a-9cb9-8e439dce5709\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://redstagfulfillment.com/how-to-ship-a-package-usps/\"},\"hash\":\"7aXVA3QrPGffM+TAaMW86DDMKLUqoCiXV9IAO5D9dPg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"24b00eb4-77f7-4839-b8ba-21e593178142\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"e+6ymgzNsBq9+8bVixnFFEmbseRqWOrKyIaLnEwccqk=\"}},\"text\":\"You

flat-rate shipping options.Retail prices start at $28.75, and you can schedule a package pickup.First-Class Mail\\nThe old-fashioned way to send a letter or package is first-class mail.To ship a package USPS First-Class Mail, you can weigh it and add postage stamps to cover the cost.Delivery time for packages is two to five business days.First-Class is only for packages that weigh 13 oz or less; you must send anything heavier by Priority Mail.Media Mail \\nUSPS will only accept certain items for Media Mail, including books, manuscripts, film, and video.The service is slower than other types of mail (two to eight days), but Media Mail is one of the cheapest ways to ship media items.Extra services from USPS\\nUSPS offers a range of extra services including:\\nShipping insurance\\nCertified Mail\\nCertificate of Mailing\\nBusiness discounts for how to ship a package USPS\\nIf you use USPS for order fulfillment, you can get volume discounts on shipping services.Here are three ways to save money when you ship a package USPS.Click-N-Ship\\nYou don’t need a business account to use Click-N-Ship.Anyone can set up a portal and print labels for Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express shipping.When you use the Click-N-Ship portal and print your own labels, you pay a lower price than you would to ship the same package at the Post Office.Small businesses with a low volume of shipments can instantly benefit from this accessible service.Click-N-Ship Business Pro\\nThe Business Pro option gives you access to software and the ability to schedule recurring shipments.Business Customer Gateway\\nTo use USPS business services like Click-N-Ship Business Pro, you need to create a Business Customer Gateway (BCG) account.BCG gives you access to premium services not available to retail Postal Service customers, as well as discounted commercial pricing.Red Stag Fulfillment gives you choice in shipping services\\nYour eCommerce business should choose

the Best Shipping Rates?– FedEx vs. UPS vs. USPS Digital commerce wouldn’t be possible without reliable delivery carriers.Each of the big three carriers – UPS, USPS, and...Who Has the Best Shipping Rates?- FedEx vs. UPS vs. USPS\\nDigital commerce wouldn’t be possible without reliable delivery carriers.Each of the big three carriers – UPS, USPS, and FedEx – move millions of packages daily.Though relatively new, e- commerce is growing at unfathomable speeds as customers rely more-and-more on online shopping.With increase in demand for shipping comes increasing demands on shipping.As the Wall Street Journal reports:\\nIn its latest survey of over 1,000 U.S.consumers, supply chain consulting firm AlixPartners LLP found that consumers expect to wait an average of 4.8 days for delivery, down from 5.5 days in 2012.And the share of those who are willing to wait more than five days has declined to 60% from\\n74% in four years.Customers increasingly want more for less from online vendors.Free shipping is a major selling point for consumers, driving up your operating expenses.Combine this with increasing rates charged by carriers, it can get a little taxing for vendors.It’s also clear that annual price hikes are part of the norm, with all three carriers raising their rates in 2018.Making sense of carrier rates requires an understanding of each company and their offerings.So who are the three big competitors vying for your traffic?FedEx\\nFedEx is the newest, and smallest, of the three major carriers.Founded in the 1970s by Fred Smith, the company was created with the express intent of being a technologically advanced carrier service.Despite their size, their leading edge truly is innovation.In 1979, for example, they introduced the tracking number to delivery.In terms of raw numbers, however, their performance is still behind the other two carriers with an average daily volume of 6 million, and a fleet size of 90,000 – smaller than UPS’s fleet of 119,000 vehicles.As an air carrier, however, they’re larger than UPS with 664 aircraft compared to 244 owned, and 320 leased by UPS.UPS\\nThe second oldest of the three carriers, UPS was founded in 1907 in Atlanta.UPS delivers to over 220 countries and territories – essentially everywhere in the world, give or take a few locations.Daily global deliveries are over 20 million packages.In 2015 UPS was the leading carrier of online deliveries.Despite their smaller fleet and revenue compared to USPS, UPS is very much a competitive figure on the market.USPS\\nThe United States Postal Service, USPS, is an old dog in the carrier kennel.Founded in 1775, there’s a lot of ink spilled on a daily basis about how it’s an antiquated relic, hemorrhaging money, and doomed to fail.Beyond the doom and gloom, though, it’s pretty clear that USPS is doing just fine as a competitor.A 10-year perspective reveals that, despite the 2008 economic crash, the agency has maintained a relatively constant revenue stream, with 2017 bringing in $69.6 billion – more than UPS at $66 billion.Comparing Rates\\nSo now to the important part: prices.Obviously, pricing depends on what you’re shipping, where it’s going, and when it needs to arrive.That said, what does the price look like if you wanted to ship a 6 x 6 x 4 inch, 12 oz package from Tennessee to Texas?\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"OiN7tRj3AGR1lj4JBi0rAsE/Zb6D9oKxEKIKXvXie78=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"49222112-74f1-401f-bd41-3ef08e639638":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"49222112-74f1-401f-bd41-3ef08e639638\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.firstmile.com/post/compare-2018-shipping-rates-of-fedex-ups-usps\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"45a23121-6306-4ac0-81f6-7fcf1a2bc804\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.firstmile.com/post/compare-2018-shipping-rates-of-fedex-ups-usps\"},\"hash\":\"RE8hi2PlNxZxg0cXbmjnrUIy2GUoQSDoPOolbrq1QBE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d584c432-c52f-4187-81b7-74869315435c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.firstmile.com/post/compare-2018-shipping-rates-of-fedex-ups-usps\"},\"hash\":\"OiN7tRj3AGR1lj4JBi0rAsE/Zb6D9oKxEKIKXvXie78=\"}},\"text\":\"USPS\\nThe

what you’re shipping, where it’s going, and when it needs to arrive.That said, what does the price look like if you wanted to ship a 6 x 6 x 4 inch, 12 oz package from Tennessee to Texas?Let's compare shipping rates:\\nFedEx Home Delivery– $13.85\\nUPS Ground - $10.72\\nUSPS First-Class Package Service - $3.82\\nThat’s pretty shocking, to say the least.When we compare shipping prices, USPS comes out to be $3.82, one third the price of the next-best price from UPS.Numbers vary, however, and USPS has its own restrictions on weight that aren’t quite as flexible as the other two carriers.USPS, for example, has a weight restriction of 70 lbs.for most deliveries.Let’s look at another scenario and compare shipping costs.You have a 65-pound package, 12 x 12 x 10 inches, and you want to ship from Atlanta to Salt Lake City.What do the prices look like on that order?FedEx Home Delivery - $94.29\\nUPS Ground - $96.10\\nUSPS Priority Mail – $99.54\\nNot a lot of variation, but FedEx comes out as the winner here.The takeaway is not that one company is always better than the others.For any specific package that needs shipping, there are many factors that affect your price.For lightweight packages, USPS tends to be the cheapest way to ship a package.For heavier packages, however, they’re not always your best option.FedEx and UPS tend to have higher average prices, but their services focus on specific types of packages and delivery.Picking your carrier requires knowledge and research; don’t take it lightly.Sources:\\nwww.prestashop.com/en/blog/comparing-3-major-shipping-carriers-ups-vs-fedex-vs-usps\\nabout.van.fedex.com/our-story/company-structure/express-fact-sheet/\\nfacts.usps.com/table-facts/\\nintegracore-587098.hs-sites.com/packaging/10-facts-that-may-not-know-about-fedex/\\nwww.wsj.com/articles/online-shoppers-want-delivery-faster-cheaper-survey-shows-1465851072\\nContact

Postal Service.\\nA sales lead from a rural carrier in Texas has resulted in a shipping deal worth more than $73,000 for the Postal Service.\\nMireya Hernandez, who works at the East Frisco Carrier Annex, helped a customer who was looking to reduce shipping costs.\\nHernandez took the customer’s information and submitted a lead.\\nJoseph Fandozzi Buggs, a sales representative, followed up with the customer and closed a shipping deal worth $73,440 in new estimated annualized revenue for the Postal Service.\\n“This customer is an eBay reseller and was using a competitor for shipping,” said Lou DeReinzo, a small-business senior specialist at USPS headquarters in Washington, DC. “But Mireya knew that USPS could do better and took the extra effort to help her customer save on shipping.”\\nSales generated from employee leads are included in the USPS Delivering for Main Street campaign to raise revenue through sales leads.\\nThe Postal Service is encouraging as many employees as possible to submit at least one lead by Sept. 30 through LEADing Together, a new program that makes it easier to pass along sales tips.\\nThe LEADing Together portal combines the Postal Service’s six employee lead generation programs into one.\\nPostal employees with ACE IDs can submit leads through the new Employee Lead Entry site on Blue by selecting the “LEADing Together” link under “Featured Topics.” Employees who do not have an ACE ID can access the site through LiteBlue by selecting “LEADing Together” under the “Featured Topics” tab.\\nCustomer 360 users can click on “LEADing Together” to access the site on that platform. Letter carriers who use a mobile delivery device, or MDD, can enter leads while on street mode, under option “U.” Business Connect Portal users have to enter a lead through the Employee Lead Entry site if an activity requires sales assistance or has resulted in a sale.\\nThe Small Business and Lead Generation Programs Blue page has more information about how employees can submit a lead.\\nPost-story highlights\\nMore to read\\n‘Friendly question’\\nRetail associate’s tip leads to $1,900 deal\\nFeb. 24, 2023\\nSold on Solt\\nCarrier’s tip leads to $74,000 deal\\nFeb. 17, 2023\\nHome run\\nCarrier helps customer with Every Door Direct Mail\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nFooter items\\nColumns\\nBriefs\\nDatebook\\nHeroes\\nHistory\\nMilestones\\nNews\\nNews Quiz\\nOff the Clock\\nOn the Job\\nPeople\\nWeek in Review\\nLink\\nAbout Link\\nArchives\\nUSPS\\nAbout USPS\\nNewsroom\\nUSPS National Employee Emergency Hotline:\\n888-363-7462\\nWeekly highlights\\nSign up for weekly highlights:\\nPrivacy Act Statement\\nCopyright © 2024 United States Postal Service.
