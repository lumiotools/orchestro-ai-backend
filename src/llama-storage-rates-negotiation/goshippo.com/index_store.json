Expensive?Hidden Shipping Costs Defined\nCalculating Actual Shipping Costs\nReduce Shipping Costs with Shippo\nFor many small to medium-sized businesses, shipping can be expensive.Besides the obvious costs, hidden expenses such as insurance and handling fees can blow up your shipping budget.Understanding these hidden costs can make a huge difference in how you manage your shipping costs effectively—not to mention save you money.Why is Shipping So Expensive?Most people understand the basics that determine shipping expenses: distance, weight, dimension, and delivery speed.However, many less obvious and often unexpected charges, such as shipping insurance, handling fees, fuel surcharges, customs duties, special packaging, and delivery zones, also contribute to shipping fees.How?The cost of shipping is directly affected by a combination of socioeconomic, environmental, and geopolitical factors.These factors can result in fluctuating fuel prices, high labor costs, and investments in infrastructure and equipment.Other contributing factors include:\nCompliance with regulations, insurance, and security measures;\nDisruptions from natural disasters and global events;\nContainer shortages and high demand for shipping services;\nAdditional expenses for greener practices;\nInflation, currency exchange rates, and trade policy changes.Hidden Shipping Costs Defined\nShipping Insurance\nShipping insurance offers shippers peace of mind and financial protection against lost, damaged, or stolen packages and covers replacement and reshipping costs when necessary.FACT: Private insurance covers the total value, unlike carrier liability, which may only go up to $100 for a $1500 gold chain as mandated by legal statutes like the Carmack Amendment.Handling Fees\nDifferent product types require various levels of care, resulting in differing costs tied to labor and resources used when preparing them for shipment—a.k.a.handling fees—for example, a customer orders delicate artwork from an online store.To ensure the artwork arrives intact, the company may charge a handling fee to cover the cost of professional packaging materials and skilled labor required to wrap it securely, place it in a sturdy crate, and label it appropriately for shipment.How to estimate handling fees\nLabor costs: Estimate the time and wages needed for handling and packing each product type.Packaging materials: Calculate the cost of necessary packaging materials, such as bubble wrap, boxes, or crates.Equipment use: Include costs for any special equipment required for handling or packing.Specialized skills: Factor in higher wages or training costs for handling items that need specialized care.Additional Charges\nThe total shipping cost can increase quickly with additional charges for remote area delivery fees, customs duties, or fuel surcharges.Fuel Surcharges: A fuel surcharge may be added to the shipping cost to cover fluctuating fuel costs.Most major carriers calculate this charge as a percentage of the base fuel rate or, in the case of DHL, as a flat fee.FACT: When fuel prices rise significantly, surcharges may escalate from 5% to 10%.Remote Area Delivery Fees: Additional labor and resources are necessary to deliver goods to rural or remote areas, increasing delivery service costs.FACT: Shipping outside standard delivery zones, typically in less populated areas, might include a $20 fee.Customs Duties: Goods shipped internationally are assessed duties and taxes, which are additional fees determined by the commodity, quantity, value, country of manufacture, and other factors.For example, if a U.S.business exports $5,000 worth of jewelry to Italy, the Italian importer may pay $200 in customs duty and $1,144 in VAT, totaling $1,344 in addition to the shipment value.TIP: To get an idea of how much your shipment's customs fees could be, consult the U.S.Customs and Border Protection customs duty information.Packaging Costs\nWhile standard packaging expenses, such as boxes and packing materials, may already be accounted for in your shipping budget, custom boxes, branded packaging, and specialty materials can significantly increase costs.For example, custom-made boxes for uniquely shaped or oversized products; special packaging for easily breakable or damageable goods; or special containers suitable for delivering frozen items can all add to expenses.FACT: Custom-branded boxes and padded packaging used to ship electronics could increase costs by as much as $10 per package.Calculating Actual Shipping Costs\nTo calculate the shipping cost accurately, start with the base rate and add hidden shipping costs, handling fees, packaging costs, and any additional fees like fuel surcharges, remote delivery fees, and customs duties.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1MoCv8wGsY1oKjtRSjdbquND/7k/gUNixFNx8xthUe0="},"0ebe1358-0cf5-47d8-b06c-1226a8e5c113":{"id_":"0ebe1358-0cf5-47d8-b06c-1226a8e5c113","metadata":{"url":"https://goshippo.com/blog/why-is-shipping-so-expensive-hidden-shipping-costs-and-fees"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"44474d2a-0408-4a88-aa36-7b4f1284b060","metadata":{"url":"https://goshippo.com/blog/why-is-shipping-so-expensive-hidden-shipping-costs-and-fees"},"hash":"yJzRttegAWpig0M/gxEo/JnFPvcZ7lGqeFG4qhEfmNo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9ba17c00-9e81-4272-9504-1e6cd7379c60","metadata":{"url":"https://goshippo.com/blog/why-is-shipping-so-expensive-hidden-shipping-costs-and-fees"},"hash":"1MoCv8wGsY1oKjtRSjdbquND/7k/gUNixFNx8xthUe0="}},"text":"TIP:

travel to get from their place of origin to their final destination.• Each carrier sets their own shipping zones—and corresponding rates.• The shipping service type you choose dictates how long the package will take to reach its destination.The Story:\nIt’s a given that monitoring expenses is key in building a thriving e-commerce business—and shipping is one cost that can quickly devour a budget.Something to consider when looking for ways to save on shipping expenses are shipping zones.Read on to learn more about what they are, why they’re important, and how understanding the way they work can help you reduce shipping costs.What Are Shipping Zones?Shipping zones (or postal zones), are the geographic perimeters or areas used to organize shipments.Shipping zones tell you how far packages have to travel to get from their place of origin to their final destination.And they cover both domestic and international areas.Carriers use shipping zones to set rates for each shipment.Rather than measuring costs based on miles traveled, shipping zones simplifies the process and also makes pricing more predictable for e-commerce shippers.Different shipping services are available for different zones as well.The place of origin and the final destination each have a corresponding postal zone.For example, the shipper might be shipping a package from zone 2 to zone 4.This will be less expensive than packages shipped to zone 6 from the same location.Shipping zones aren’t universal.In fact, each carrier sets their own shipping zones—and corresponding rates:\nUSPS shipping zones are both international and domestic.USPS shipping zones apply to and vary between Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express, Priority Mail Regional Rate, and First-Class Package Service.Shipping zones do not affect rates for USPS Flat Rate shipping.FedEx shipping zones are also both domestic and international.FedEx Freight also offers zone-based pricing for FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy shipments.UPS shipping zones are only available for domestic shipments.Why Are Shipping Zones Important?Shipping zones matter because they are a significant factor in figuring out the cost of the shipment.This is how carriers determine their rates for each shipment.In addition to cost, postal zones help merchants predict how long shipments will take.This is important because today’s consumers expect not only free, but also fast shipping.Free shipping is important to 83 percent of American shoppers, and speed of delivery is the second-most important factor in the decision to buy.In fact, most customers opt for 2-3 day shipping instead of 4-7 days.If you’re using zoned shipping services to fulfill customer orders, review this information to ensure you are setting realistic expectations for cost and arrival.How to Calculate Shipping Zones\nTo calculate shipping zones, you’ll want to refer to the respective carrier’s resources.You’ll need the origin and destination zip codes, as well as information about the package like size, weight, shape, etc. Heavy, large packages typically come with higher shipping costs.You can also choose which shipping service you plan to use, as this may affect the rate as well.It will also affect zip code and zone availability—some shipping services, for example, are only available for a limited range of destination zones.The shipping service type also dictates how long the package will take to reach its destination.Keep in mind that if you have to split an order and fulfill from different warehouses, the shipping rates might be different for each package.While this is a great way to reduce shipping time, it might come with added costs.Should You Charge Customers for Zone Shipping?As mentioned, fast and free has become the new black.But if it’s not possible for you to offer it right now, a  little creativity can help you recoup those expenses and still create a positive customer experience.Here are a few ideas: \n• Bake shipping costs into the product price.This way customers are reimbursing your for shipping without even knowing it.• Test different shipping options.Use conversion rate optimization (CRO) software to run A/B tests with various shipping options and charges.• Offer free shipping to close customers.For shoppers in your shipping zone or not far from it, you can set up a rule so they get free shipping while others may pay an additional fee.• Use free shipping as a promotion—be it a limited time sale or a coupon code in exchange for an email subscription.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hgvLjNrJ/CuXw8wAoXSs5AcIdbnGOCEBjJZE5BVyecw="},"00badd1a-4aaf-4712-b11f-42b73457634c":{"id_":"00badd1a-4aaf-4712-b11f-42b73457634c","metadata":{"url":"https://goshippo.com/blog/what-are-shipping-zones-and-why-do-they-matter"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e1784b6f-fef0-4bed-8488-f5b60994c46d","metadata":{"url":"https://goshippo.com/blog/what-are-shipping-zones-and-why-do-they-matter"},"hash":"AUP5oXHJsW5BCt8gBQZ97ZZY70liFIiPFPun6XT5w2s="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"53b0ab6b-e401-464a-a8db-b80a97165da2","metadata":{"url":"https://goshippo.com/blog/what-are-shipping-zones-and-why-do-they-matter"},"hash":"hgvLjNrJ/CuXw8wAoXSs5AcIdbnGOCEBjJZE5BVyecw="}},"text":"While

the process of shipping will need to be able to scale along with it.More than half of retailers say the cost of shipping is their biggest business challenge.And as consumers get more accustomed to free and expedited shipping, not to mention free returns, e-commerce brands will need to find ways to keep costs in check and streamline fulfillment operations.Flat rate shipping is one option that can make it easier to predict shipping expenses and potentially help you reduce shipping costs.If you’re not super familiar with flat rate shipping, or just want to learn more about how it might benefit your e-commerce business, consider this your cheat sheet.What Does Flat Rate Shipping Mean?Plain and simple, Flat rate shipping refers to the single, uniform fee charged to ship a package, given that it meets the stipulations set by the flat rate shipping provider.Flat rate shipping is a simplified process that allows consumers the convenience of an uncomplicated shipping option, and the ability for businesses to forecast shipping expenses with greater accuracy and predictability.As an added bonus, it can be especially helpful for shipping heavier items.When people mention “flat rate shipping,” they’re often referring to USPS Flat Rate shipping.USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate shipping delivers within three days (not including Sunday).These shipping boxes can be an easy-to-use, cost-effective shipping option.Flat Rate vs. Standard Shipping\nWhile flat rate shipping includes a consistent fee for packages, standard shipping varies more.Standard shipping rates might be applied based on size, shape, weight, distance traveled, or even package type.Each carrier sets their own standard shipping rates.How Much Does Flat Rate Shipping Cost?Flat rate shipping has a uniform cost, but this varies depending on the envelope or box you use to send the package.Here are how the USPS Flat Rate fees break down:\nHow Long Does Flat Rate Shipping Take?USPS Flat Rate shipping generally takes between one and three days, excluding Sunday, depending on package origin and its final destination.Packages shipped via flat rate are sent via USPS Priority Mail.Should You Use Flat Rate Shipping?In short, It depends.Flat rate shipping is great in some people and not so great for others.For one, you need to make sure your shipping software will accommodate USPS Flat Rate shipping.If it doesn’t, you won’t be able to take advantage of this option.Or, you’ll need to find a new shipping software.Beyond that, it really boils down to the cost.Use a shipping calculator to help you compare.Shipping costs depend on a few key factors:\nDistance traveled: Referred to as zones, USPS applies fees based on the origin and destination zones of each package.Typically, standard shipping costs are based on the distance between zones—the further you ship, the more it costs.Weight: All carriers institute weight limits for their uniform shipping options.USPS flat rate boxes allow up to 70 pounds of weight, making anything heavier ineligible for the flat rate shipping option.Size: Flat rate shipping is only available in specific box sizes and shapes.Some items cannot be shipped via flat rate shipping because they will not fit in flat rate boxes.Overall, small, heavy objects are ideal for USPS Flat Rate shipping, especially when traveling far distances.Bed sheets, books, metal objects, and various home goods are perfect candidates for flat rate shipping.Lightweight objects might be better suited for other shipping methods.Related: When is USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Cheaper than USPS Priority Mail?>\nLower costs aside, flat rate shipping also offers a fair amount of convenience.You can order USPS Flat Rate boxes online or pick them up from the post office free of change.Then being able to rely upon consistent shipping charges will make forecasting and planning easier and more straightforward for your business.Moving Forward With Your Shipping Needs\nIf you’re

concerned with are which carriers you should be using and what your costs will look like.However, as your business grows, you’re able to deepen your understanding of shipping processes — including more complex factors like US shipping zones.Even if you’ve never heard of shipping zones before, they play a major role in how the shipping costs you’ll pay are assessed.Read on for more about what shipping zones are and how they can affect your e-commerce business.What are Shipping Zones?Shipping zones are geographical regions determined by distance from a shipment’s origin point, which carriers use to set the package’s estimated transit time and shipping costs.Often, it’s easiest to understand shipping zones for e-commerce businesses by looking at an example.In the graphic below, the shipping zones associated with a package being sent by UPS® Ground from the 10001 zip code in New York are shaded with different colors.Image Source: UPS\nIn this case, the bright yellow cluster represents the first shipping zone — nearest to New York — from which packages only require one business day for delivery.As the distance from this first zone increases, transit times grow — and, although they aren’t included on this graphic, shipping charges increase as well.This image also demonstrates the dynamically generated nature of shipping zones.Because shipping zones are based on distance from a package’s origin point, no universal set of shipping zone maps exist.Instead, specific zone maps depend on the carrier being used, the original shipment location, and the destination the shipment is headed to.How Shipping Zones Affect E-Commerce Businesses\nShipping zones primarily affect e-commerce businesses in two ways: price and transit time.The Price Impact of Shipping Zones\nThe further your packages need to travel from your origin point, the higher your costs will be.Carriers assess charges this way to recoup their own transportation costs.But if you ship packages to multiple destinations around the country, it’s important to know that your per-package costs could vary significantly — and that you may need to account for this in your pricing.For example, imagine that you frequently sell goods that ship in a 2-lb package measuring 8” x 5” x 1”.To ship your parcel from New York, NY to a Washington, DC residence via FedEx 2Day®, the retail rate for your delivery (as of this writing) would be $30.20.Yet, if you want to ship the same package to a further shipping zone such as Los Angeles, CA via the same service, your retail rate would be $55.34.If you assess all customers a standard $30 charge for two-day shipping, you’ll break even shipping to Washington, DC, but lose more than $25 shipping to Los Angeles!With Shippo’s Live Rates at Checkout, you can instead show your customer’s their accurate and least costly shipping options during the checkout process.Using factors such as the shipping zone your package is traveling and the dimensions of the package, your customers will see the cheapest shipping rates so that they don’t overpay and you don’t overpay.Transit Times and Shipping Zones\nVariable transit times across shipping zones can also affect how your e-commerce business plans its shipping strategy.Take the UPS® Ground map shared above.If you’re shipping from New York, NY, and you’ve promised your customers two-day shipping, you should be able to meet expectations with UPS® Ground shipping for customers located in the yellow and brown areas of the map (excluding the possibility of carrier delays).Once you move into the green, red, or orange areas, however, you or your customers will likely need to pay for more expensive air shipping for your packages to arrive on time.Even if you don’t plan to change shipping services based on transit time, you can still use shipping zone maps to communicate expected delivery windows to your customers.For instance, if you always ship from New York using the same carrier and service, you could publish a zone map to your website to set delivery expectations with shoppers and minimize confusion or disappointment after they’ve ordered.How to Calculate Shipping Zones\nBecause shipping zones aren’t fixed, there’s no single web page you can go to that contains them all.Instead, you’ll need to use carrier websites or other third-party tools to calculate shipping zones and their associated fees.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"QIGeM4jkD8OGAmQpt3Pwp6i1ZR+zCINtNFTwP33ZUNk="},"42efe563-8cc5-419c-9e46-da99a3ca2205":{"id_":"42efe563-8cc5-419c-9e46-da99a3ca2205","metadata":{"url":"https://goshippo.com/shipping/shipping-zones-what-they-are-and-how-they-affect-ecommerce-business"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"475ae057-a79b-4acb-ae6f-387322bff06b","metadata":{"url":"https://goshippo.com/shipping/shipping-zones-what-they-are-and-how-they-affect-ecommerce-business"},"hash":"ZRVQF9I13WlQ2T6dMaxaY6Kurd9y68z0nhr7IuIvjuw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9a4e01e4-50dc-4601-8a7b-c662388e3e6b","metadata":{"url":"https://goshippo.com/shipping/shipping-zones-what-they-are-and-how-they-affect-ecommerce-business"},"hash":"QIGeM4jkD8OGAmQpt3Pwp6i1ZR+zCINtNFTwP33ZUNk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1b41adad-e70c-45e6-a9b8-bfb85a1897b0","metadata":{},"hash":"SUsK9QeBTXUM6YZguRSSu13O8Wiv8gnokMAHQ5WRAlI="}},"text":"Once

calculate shipping zones and their associated fees.Setting up a Shippo account will allow you to estimate transit times for different services, or you can visit the following carrier sites directly:\nUSPS Domestic Zone Chart\nUPS® Ground Shipping Zone Maps\nFedEx Ground Shipping Zone Maps\nHow to Decrease Costs Associated with Shipping Zones\nIf you’re a solopreneur shipping e-commerce goods from a single location, one option for decreasing costs related to shipping zones is to work with flat-fee shipping services.For example, take the 2-lb package described above.Originally, shipping the parcel by FedEx 2Day® cost $55.34.However, the same goods could be shipped in a USPS Priority Mail Small Flat Rate box for a retail rate of $9.20 and still arrive in 1-3 business days.While there won’t always be a cheaper flat-fee service you can turn to, it’s still worth a look.Further, as your volume grows, you may be able to further reduce shipping costs by partnering with fulfillment centers that are closer to your customers.Before taking this step, however, you’ll want to closely track purchase location and volume patterns, as well as to determine whether the potential savings from lower shipping costs justifies the additional expense of introducing a new step into your fulfillment process.How Shipping Zones Affect Your Ability to Offer Free Shipping\nAmazon has certainly upped the pressure on smaller merchants to offer the same free shipping services that Prime customers have grown accustomed to.But if you want to match this standard,
