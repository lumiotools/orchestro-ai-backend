Especially with growing supply chain demands and costs this pandemic season.\\nBut, low-cost supply chains can become a norm if you know how to optimize your logistics systems.\\nHow to build a resilient and successful supply chain\\nSupply chain management is a complex network of manufacturing and logistics systems involving a wide range of activities.\\nOrganizing supply chains for resilience and robustness may seem impossible. But it can be achieved if you structure your supply chain activities for efficiency.\\nFor simplicity and clarity, let’s break down supply chain management into 5 stages:\\n1.  Mapping and Planning\\n2. Sourcing the Raw Materials\\n3. Manufacturing Goods and Packaging Into Products\\n4. Delivery and Logistics\\n5. Returns, Refunds, and Reverse Logistics\\nStage 1: Mapping and Planning Your Supply Chain\\nPlanning is the most crucial step. This is where you devise a supply chain operations strategy. But before you do that, identify your customer’s needs first, and establish a product-manufacture fit.\\nWhat is Product-Manufacture Fit?\\n\\nProduct-manufacture fit is a supply chain experimentation and mobilization strategy to minimize costs, mitigate risks and maximize profits. To create a supply chain experimentation plan, explore the manufacturing possibilities, raw material sourcing options, and optimize the processes to create a profitable and sustainable supply chain.\\nStage 2: Sourcing The Raw Materials\\nTo begin, here are the steps and processes involved in manufacturing goods:\\nThe next logical step is to choose the most optimal production plan and decide how your supply chain manages:\\nMaterial resource planning – both direct materials and indirect materials\\nPurchasing materials based on seasonal demand calculation\\nManufacturing of goods\\nSetting up assembly points for partially manufactured goods\\nSetting up pricing\\nDelivery planning\\nSetting up payment policies, procedures, and processes with suppliers\\nSetting up negotiating contracts with suppliers and carrier companies\\nCreating quality control metrics by regulating traceability\\nStage 3: Manufacturing Goods and Packaging Into Products\\nNow that we’ve figured out sourcing raw materials and resource planning, it’s time to add value to the raw materials.\\nThis process is called manufacturing.\\nManufacturing and delivering a product on time, within the allotted budget is the number one goal at this stage.\\nAs time goes on and technology advances, manufacturing systems and processes are becoming more and more complex.\\nLet’s look at this example: In the 18th and 19th centuries, the industrial revolution transformed economies because of the well-established relationship between customers and suppliers. In fact, The National Academy Press quotes:\\n“By 1920, well-developed relationships between customers and suppliers facilitated the emergence of ‘mass production.’” \\nAnd as we speak, mass production is at an all-time high. This brings us to the million-dollar question. Is it possible to manage such large-scale production units and complex supply chain management systems seamlessly?\\nThe answer is yes.\\nModern supply chains strive for tracking and reducing redundant supply chain steps and having more control over the manufacturing and operations processes. And they achieve this using business intelligence and advanced AI technology.\\nQuick note: A logistics intelligence system helps you tap into your supply chain’s mind and control its matter. Take proactive steps to optimize your modern supply chain operations by getting a complete overview of your business that saves you money.

Because they’re all headed towards the end goal – to deliver a product to the customer.\\nOnce the customer files for a return, the processes that are triggered after this point are called reverse logistics.\\nWhat happens to a product after it’s filed for return?\\nReverse logistics starts by tracking the products filed for return. They’re then categorized into:\\nDefective\\nDamaged\\nOutdated products\\nLow quality\\nWrong product\\nLate delivery\\nOver-purchase\\nRecalled by government\\nThe 5 stages of a supply chain system represent the high-level, big-picture decisions and tactical operational overview you can tap into to optimize your systems.\\nBut to optimize your supply chain systems, you should first be able to identify the root causes that slow down the supply chain and contribute to revenue loss.\\nFactors Affecting Supply Chain Performance\\n715 supply chains were surveyed for research, and it was observed that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted 78% of these supply chains.\\nThat’s a big number, and it shows how susceptible our supply chain systems are.\\nBut, even on an average day, many factors are influencing your profits (or losses):\\nFuel Costs:\\nWith escalating oil prices, logistics costs spiral upward as well. So to get to the root cause, what’s causing a spike in oil prices? Crude oil prices, refining costs, retail distribution, freight and processing charges, excise duty, and dealer commission are some of the factors that contribute to increasing fuel prices.\\nDelayed Shipment Arrival:\\nOut of the scope of delivery partners, shipments can be delayed due to various reasons. Bad weather (caused due to hurricanes, cyclones, etc.), piracy, regional wars, fire hazards, changes in traffic schedules (especially for inland traffic), etc., can cause shipment delays. Other than that, the primary reasons causing delayed shipments leading to increased logistics costs are shortage of containers, vessel space, and ships for transportation, especially after a holiday season.\\nDelayed Delivery:\\nLack of delivery personnel or the unavailability from the end customer can cause delivery delays. In such cases, the product has to be stored in a warehouse. And this leads to an increase in warehouse charges. To reduce warehouse rental charges, several logistics partners prefer cross-docking their product line and deliver the product directly from the supplier to the customer, doing away with warehousing.\\nGovernment Regulations:\\nRules of international trade are complex. Processing legal permit documents, compliance checks, and contracts add to the extra supply chain costs. Authorities impose these regulations at various levels like federal, state, and local. The anti-idling and other emission reduction regulations can cause a significant increase in annual compliance costs.\\nLet’s look at how we can leverage business intelligence in logistics to track and save these costs.\\nHow To Use Logistics Intelligence To Track And Reduce Supply Chain Costs\\nLogistics Intelligence is nothing but supply chains using and simulating human intelligence processes, with the help of machines, to speed up their manufacturing systems, reduce churn, and increase their manufacturing rate efficiently by reducing their manufacturing cycles to a fraction.\\nLet’s look at an example.\\nCisco is one of the largest and best supply chains in the world. In Gartner’s 2021 report, Cisco was rated the best supply chain leader for the second consecutive year. These rankings were based on the resilience, agility, and sustainability of the supply chains.\\nWhat did these companies do differently to thrive during a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic?\\nThey adopted the digital-first approach and employed business intelligence to automate and speed up the processes that require little to no maintenance, hence saving them millions of dollars in costs.\\nA survey of boards of directors taken late in 2020 showed that nearly 70% of companies accelerated their digital roadmaps, as compared to the beginning of the year.\\nLet’s look at the benefits of logistics intelligence.\\nHow Logistics Intelligence Helps Improve Supply Chain Resilience And Agility\\nAutomates data collection processes and reduces human effort and time\\nIdentifies negative trends and controls costs effectively with a detailed overview of the supply chain\\nUses real-time data to manage operations and build a dependable, efficient supply chain\\nTracks and minimizes long and inefficient delivery routes to increase supply chain performance\\nExtrapolates insights and devise a profitable financial plan\\nImproves business forecasting by analyzing price fluctuation and route suggestions\\nGroups similar products and plans your packaging better by using efficient space planning with package measurement data insights\\nUncovers redundant routes and decreases logistics waste by analyzing network hubs, bottlenecks, warehouses, and other logistics elements\\nOverall, logistics Intelligence helps a business improve its decision-making process with real-time, accurate data. Business intelligence tools convert data into digestible chunks of information and represent the information visually to help with faster decision-making.\\nHow To Use Logistics Intelligence To Optimize Supply Chain Processes\\nDiverse goals and disconnected processes in large value chains make end-to-end optimization challenging.\\nLogistics Intelligence brings independent supply chain processes and unifies them to work as one integrated unit to achieve its end goals and enhance supply chain visibility. Let’s look at how to use this visibility to build agile supply chain companies.\\nHow to Leverage Reporting in Logistics Intelligence To Build Faster Supply Chains\\nHaving easy access to detailed reports with transport provider’s data, including metrics like weight, package dimensions, expected delivery time, tender acceptance rate, etc., solves half the worries.\\nIt makes tracking supply chain systems more accurate and faster.\\nLogistics Dashboard reports can be generated instantly.\\nVisualization tools like these sync the objectives together and bring clarity to crucial economic decisions and opportunities.\\nUnlike traditional data mining methods, there’s no more waiting for weeks and months to study current trends and understand supply chain operations.\\nHow to Use Real-Time Dashboards To Grow Your Supply Chain Business\\nInstantaneous data is the driving force behind robust, agile supply chains because they dramatically decrease monotonous human effort and save tons of time spent on mining voluminous data.\\nLet’s take an example of a mining plant. In case of a crisis like shortage of workers or regional connectivity, real-time data equips you with quick reaction time and ensures safety before it’s too late.\\nSimilarly, let’s say a package is delayed due to freight arrival delay. If all the tracking data were left trusted with the 3PL or freight services like UPS or FedEx, you wouldn’t really know what’s happening with the freight cargo until there was a barrage of complaints from angry customers.\\nTo avoid such an emergency, you could get ahead of your next action step with real-time tracking. If the freight cargo is getting delayed, dashboard data conveys that to you immediately. You can communicate with your customers beforehand and inform them of the causes of the delay and avoid bad reviews that hamper your brand’s reputation and cost you profits in the long run.\\nHow to Optimize Supply Chains and Reduce Carrier Charges\\nThe pandemic has triggered the eCommerce boom like never before.\\nHigh consumer goods demand has resulted in container shortages and soaring freight cargo charges. Global shipping rates have seen a record spike in recent months.\\nAccording to Freightos, the cost to ship a container from China to the U.S. East Coast in November was a shocking $4,750. It cost 42% less in July 2020. At this rate, soaring container charges can prove to be a huge impediment to supply chain companies. And the numbers are not going down anytime soon.\\nBut, there is a way to reduce carrier costs. Let’s look at some cost optimization strategies:\\nOptimize Carrier Miles and Reduce Transportation Costs\\nTransportation cost amounts to a significant number in overall supply chain spending. Unfortunately, this cost is passed onto the customers. Product costs keep increasing, leading to decreased customer retention rate – and a reduction in revenue and profits. However, here’s how we can tackle rising transportation costs.\\nUse Fewer Carriers to Reduce Dead Miles\\nHaving multiple carriers often gives good service. But if larger loads are assigned to a single carrier vendor, there is a possibility to lower rates across all routes. Not all individual routes will cost less than other carriers. However, if one considers all the routes and calculates the total cost, such an arrangement will work out to be cheaper.\\nThe manufacturers can outline their requirements, roll out a quotation request, and evaluate different bidders for the job.\\nHaving long-term contracts with carriers gives them time to shape up an efficient network with minimal or no dead miles, resulting in savings up to 3-5%. A contract for a longer duration also means locked-in rates, which otherwise may go up every year.\\nLoad Boarding or Feight Boarding Can Save Costs\\nImagine there’s a truck driver stationed in Kansas after a full load delivery from Georgia. He’s done his job, and now it’s time to head back home. But he’ll be clocking an empty load – which is a massive loss for small business owners like him.\\nNow, he has two options:\\nA. Head back home with an empty truckload and uncompensated miles.\\nB. Look for a return load on freight marketplace and maximize his profits by reducing downtime.\\nThe latter option is a win-win for three logistics parties here – supply chain companies looking for carriers, truck drivers looking for load boards, and third-party carriers connecting supply chains with truck drivers.\\nFor a supply chain company, having a load board for a one-off shipment can fetch you lower rates, especially if they are carried as backhauls. And sometimes, carriers may be ready to charge only fuel costs and a little extra for such loads to avoid empty miles cost.\\nHave a Steady Volume Contract to Reduce Recurring Charges\\nIf you have a steady flow of freight for a repeat destination, the carrier can market and book return freight trips. Hence reducing the transportation cost significantly.\\nThe added advantage is the priority given to suppliers who have regular freight volumes.\\nThis is especially beneficial on days with tight transport capacity. You not only save in recurring carrier costs, but you’ll also save the extra costs that may incur during high-demand seasons.\\nOptimum Inventory Storage Reduces Variable Costs\\nFor cost-effective operations, inventory should be replenished to an optimum number, consistently.\\nNow, why have an inventory stock?\\nTo reduce supplier lead time and deliver products on time as and when the orders chime in.\\nOptimum stocking also means measuring and expecting order capacity to avoid overstocking, which results in losses.\\nSome of the factors to consider while calculating optimum inventory levels include:\\nDemand variability\\nManufacturing time\\nTransportation time\\nDelivery lead time\\nQuick Tip: The safe amount of inventory is the quantity of goods/raw material that doesn’t affect the manufacturing cycle due to shortage of material or cost more for storage.\\nReducing Sourcing and Storing costs\\nFinding a supplier who not only supplies raw material but also stores it until the raw material procurement requests begin is a smart way to reduce warehousing costs. This is called an Integrated Supply Chain System.\\nContracting a single vendor for all logistics and transportation requirements can allow manufacturers to negotiate and reduce overall costs. The manufacturers can outline their requirements and roll out a request for quotation and evaluate annual contracts for efficient management. This system is called Single Sourcing, and it saves the manufacturer tons of time and money. Because there is no need to solicit and review bids from a variety of suppliers every single time there’s a transport request, it saves months in man-hours and hence reduces costs.\\nConsolidating Shipments\\nIt is cost-effective to consolidate shipments to make Full container load (FCL) or Truckload (TL) going in the same direction. The other advantage of FCL or TL is that carriers load goods according to your specifications. This reduces the chance of custom delays in case other shipments in the container don’t adhere to government regulations. Consolidated larger shipments can give potential savings up to 50% as opposed to smaller shipments. For a small shipment, the shipper may end up paying a huge amount as minimum charges over a period of time. Sharing freight savings with the retailer may influence the retailer to book larger shipments.\\nAlso, incentivizing larger shipments is not only cheaper, it’s sustainable.\\nWhen FCL or TL is not possible, then it is economical to consolidate shipment of size Less than Truckload (LTL) or LCL (Less than a Container Load) of one or more suppliers going towards the same destination.\\nMinimize Touch-Points\\nBig chain retailers procure their merchandise directly from manufacturers. As much as possible, individual merchandise should be touched only when a consumer buys it off the rack to reduce manpower and warehousing costs.\\nBut how do you decide what logistics strategy applies right now for the current situation?\\nThis is where logistics intelligence helps you map out current events and trends and derive the right information needed to pull out of an emergency/crisis quickly.\\nArriving at an optimum inventory number depending on season and demand is impossible without a logistics intelligence system that displays historical trends and showcases supply chain behavior in a visual format.\\nHere’s how eSigns.com saved $375,000 in 12 months using Sifted’s LI platform.

Shipping surcharges are also included in the GRI.\\nMoreover, the increase in shipping fees is not uniform through service levels. For example, there might be a 4.5% increase in ground shipping, but a 5.5% increase may apply to express mail. Similarly, carriers charge different additional handling surcharges for each shipping zone.\\nAs you can imagine, the uneven shipping rate distribution directly affects the profitability of the shippers.\\nIn this article, we look at the best ways to effectively manage shipping cost changes and save money for your business.\\nAre shipping charges catching you off guard? Gain full visibility into your supply chain operations with Sifted’s Logistics Intelligence solutions.\\nPeak Season Shipping Checklist\\nDownload Now\\n7 Solutions You Can Implement to Reduce Shipping Costs\\nIf shippers are not careful, the regular rise in shipping costs can destroy their bottom line. These rate changes affect your shipping spend just as much as other factors like shipping distance, DIM weight, and taxes.\\nLet’s look at some ways you can reduce costs and protect your business from carrier rate changes.\\n1. Consider outsourcing portions of order fulfillment to a 3PL.\\nFulfilling all your orders from the same location gets expensive when you factor in the shipping across multiple shipping zones. Carriers charge higher fees for shipping to customers living in higher shipping zones. This means you either absorb the cost of shipping and reduce your profit margins or make your customers pay for them and risk losing sales.\\nBy outsourcing portions of your inventory to a third-party logistics company, you can fulfill customer orders from fulfillment centers located closer to their geographic location. This helps speed up delivery times, reduce shipping costs, and save on your own warehouse space.\\n3PLs manage and fulfill a large number of orders each month. Sheer economies of scale gives them access to lower prices on everything including packaging supplies, so they pass on these cost savings to their customers.\\nSimilarly, 3PLs can provide you with lower rates because they can negotiate volume discounts from carriers due to their large shipping volume.\\n2. Weigh packages and reduce dimensions.\\nPackage dimensions and weight are two critical factors that affect the shipping fees charged by carriers. Optimizing your packaging can help you reduce the cost of shipping and boost your profit margins.\\nWhether you take the packages to the post office yourself or schedule pick up at your location, you should measure the weight and dimensions of your package beforehand, and attach the right shipping label. Sometimes a 1-2 pound weight difference results in double the shipping cost. Using a postage scale and tape measure, you’ll get closer to an accurate estimate of the shipping costs and avoid any unexpected fees and surcharges.\\nMost major carriers use the higher of the actual weight and dimensional weight to calculate the shipping rates. The dimensional weight takes into account the space occupied by your package to determine the shipping cost. This means that using a large box to pack a relatively smaller product could lead to higher shipping fees than if you would use the right box size to compactly pack your products.\\nA good rule of thumb is to measure the actual and dimensional weight of the product and packaging, especially if you sell products that are lightweight and large in size. If their dimensional weight is more than the actual weight, you should consider designing custom boxes that match the size and shape of your products. This option is particularly helpful if you sell such products in high volume.\\nSimilarly, you can reduce package dimensions and weight by using lightweight packaging materials like bubble wrap, air pillows, and foam inserts. Corrugated boxes are also a lighter alternative to cardboard boxes and offer more impact resistance.\\n3. Offer a flat rate shipping fee to all customers.\\nFedEx and UPS increased their shipping fees by an average of 5.9%, and USPS hiked rates by an average of 2.7%. And when you factor in surcharges, the shipping process becomes more complicated for both shippers and customers.\\nIn contrast, flat rate shipping offers the simplest pricing system as you charge the same shipping fees regardless of the order size and weight. This option is only feasible, though, if your products are similar in weight and size (e.g. cosmetics products), or if most of your customers order similar quantities (e.g. subscription boxes). You can encourage your customers to order within a specific weight or quantity range to qualify for discounted flat rates.\\nAlternatively, you can use flat rate boxes provided by your shipping carriers to mail your packages. They take the guesswork out of calculating the cost of shipping, so shippers don’t have to worry about any surprises.\\nAre shipping mistakes slipping past your glance? Take better charge of your shipping costs to avoid mistakes with Sifted’s Logistics Intelligence solutions.\\n4. Look into offers from platforms and marketplaces you sell on.\\nAn effective way to save money is to outsource your shipping to Amazon, AliExpress, or a similar shipping solution. It may seem like a costly option, but it lets you cut down on other expenses such as hiring workers, warehousing and storage, and order processing. Plus, Amazon offers free 2-day shipping, enabling shippers to delight their customers with fast delivery times. This option is only available, however, if you are selling on these platforms.\\nAmazon Prime Day also provides a great opportunity for retailers to offer free shipping to Prime members. It lets them select a day of the week to receive all their orders. Similarly, Amazon offers discounted rates to eligible sellers for LTL and FTL shipments.\\nEtsy is another useful eCommerce shipping option for small businesses that want to keep costs low. It lets you create and print shipping labels online and even offers order tracking to your customers.\\n5. Keep an eye on shipping carriers’ pricing changes.\\nShipping carriers like UPS and FedEx announce a change in shipping charges on a yearly basis known as the General Rate Increase (GRI). This pricing change is the adjustment of shipping rates depending on the requirements of demand and supply chain in the shipping industry and increased prices of fuel and labor.\\nIn addition to the base shipping rates, carriers also change their surcharges (e.g. fuel surcharges). However, you can still negotiate discounted rates, especially if you have a high shipping volume with your carrier.\\nThe implication of an annual rate increase for shippers and eCommerce store owners is that they might need to adjust the prices of their products to protect their bottom line.\\nCarrier price changes along with different shipping options and shipping zones make shipping parcels more complex.\\nSifted’s software helps businesses stay on top of carrier rate changes and optimize parcel shipping costs.\\n6. Choose the right packaging.\\nThe weight and size of your package greatly impacts the total shipping cost. One of the most effective ways to target lower rates is to use alternative packing materials like poly mailers instead of cardboard boxes.\\nCardboard packaging is heavy, and using lightweight poly mailer bags to ship packages helps you cut down on package weight. Similarly, cardboard box sizes are fixed, meaning its package dimensions decide the shipping costs even if there is empty space inside. In contrast, poly mailer bags are compact, making them more cost-effective than cardboard boxes for shipping non-fragile items like sweaters and pillows.\\nAnother great way to lower shipping costs is to use packing supplies provided by your shipping carrier. Major carriers like FedEx, USPS, and DHL offer discounted packing materials to small retail stores and eCommerce businesses. In fact, USPS Priority Mail customers get better rates (along with shipping insurance) when they use the carrier’s shipping supplies compared to using their own packaging.\\nExperienced shippers know that buying packing materials like boxes, poly mailers, and dunnage in bulk achieves cost savings in the long run. Each unit cost reduces for each parcel when you buy packaging in bulk quantity.\\n7. Utilize a logistics intelligence tool.\\nWhen you self-fulfilling orders, you usually spend a lot of time receiving and processing orders. As a result, you have less clarity about the effects of shipment cost trends on your business.\\nA logistics intelligence tool gives you access to data analytics and automation tools that help you identify opportunities for cost savings. It lets you compare and analyze different shipment scenarios to understand true fulfillment costs. With this information, you’ll can optimize your logistics budget, and drive supply chain performance while substantially reducing your costs.\\nOptimize your shipping costs with Sifted Logistics Intelligence\\nOutsourcing your order fulfillment to a 3PL, offering flat rate shipping, and investing in a logistics solution are just a few simple ways you can reduce shipping costs and better manage the impact of carrier rate changes on your business.\\nSifted Logistics Intelligence offers tools for shippers to better optimize and understand their shipping costs and where they can be reduced.\\nReady to protect your business from shipping fee changes?

The new platform dramatically reduces transportation expenses for shippers while optimizing for delivery times and best-in-class customer experience. The combined company is backed by global growth equity investor Summit Partners, which invested in VeriShip in 2018. This marks the second transaction for VeriShip in the last year, following its acquisition of Valence in December, 2019. VeriShip and Sifted’s clients range from small and medium business, such as Simple Tire and Chicago Music Exchange to enterprise-level organizations like Shutterfly, Boston Scientific, and Kendra Scott.\\nThe combination creates a new model for managing transportation spend — one that brings together the power of self-service technology and transportation data science to help shippers navigate an increasingly complex shipping environment fueled by dramatic e-commerce growth. The companies will merge capabilities under the Sifted brand, and all clients will migrate to the new platform and will gain immediate access to easy-to-understand, 360-degree analytics of their data.\\n“For most businesses today, especially those in e-commerce, it is impossible to make data-driven decisions. Shippers are constantly blindsided by carrier changes, and they’re expected to fulfill shipments on time, implement new systems, manage inventory problems, and improve efficiencies, all while keeping costs in check. Now, with the combined power of VeriShip’s data set and Sifted’s predictive modeling capabilities, our platform will prescribe actions and prevent unnecessary spending before it ever happens,” said VeriShip Chief Executive Officer Shawn McCarrick.\\nEffective today, the companies will integrate business operations to create the most capable team in the industry. Shawn McCarrick will lead the company as CEO. Sifted’s three co-founders, Adam Moulding, Mark Chamberlain and Caleb Nelson, will serve as Chief Operating Officer, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Revenue Officer, respectively. VeriShip’s George Meier will jointly lead sales as Chief Business Development Officer alongside Nelson. All other existing business leaders in both organizations remain and will continue serving in critical roles.\\n“The Sifted platform enables shippers to move away from educated guessing to decisions based on data science and provides highly accurate predictions using software for optimization and modeling,” said Adam Moulding, the new entity’s Chief Operating Officer. “We are giving shippers the clarity, control and freedom they need to forecast and proactively manage shipping costs.”\\nAbout VeriShip\\nVeriShip is the nation’s largest spend management and payments platform that tracks and analyzes shipping data to reduce costs for small and midsize businesses shipping packages throughout the U.S. Its platform gives clients control and clarity into their shipping data with a single source of visibility into transportation spend.

Is Now Live - See What's New Watch\\nHow To Track, Optimize, And Reduce Shipping Costs and Supply Chain Carrier Charges\\nby Sifted Team\\nAug 9, 2021\\n15 min read\\nView All Articles\\nIs it too much to expect a dependable, low-cost carrier service?With tight margins, fierce competition, and demanding customers, logistics management has become a significant challenge for supply chain companies.Especially with growing supply chain demands and costs this pandemic season.But, low-cost supply chains can become a norm if you know how to optimize your logistics systems.How to build a resilient and successful supply chain\\nSupply chain management is a complex network of manufacturing and logistics systems involving a wide range of activities.Organizing supply chains for resilience and robustness may seem impossible.But it can be achieved if you structure your supply chain activities for efficiency.For simplicity and clarity, let’s break down supply chain management into 5 stages:\\n1.Mapping and Planning\\n2.Sourcing the Raw Materials\\n3.Manufacturing Goods and Packaging Into Products\\n4.Delivery and Logistics\\n5.Returns, Refunds, and Reverse Logistics\\nStage 1: Mapping and Planning Your Supply Chain\\nPlanning is the most crucial step.This is where you devise a supply chain operations strategy.But before you do that, identify your customer’s needs first, and establish a product-manufacture fit.What is Product-Manufacture Fit?Product-manufacture fit is a supply chain experimentation and mobilization strategy to minimize costs, mitigate risks and maximize profits.To create a supply chain experimentation plan, explore the manufacturing possibilities, raw material sourcing options, and optimize the processes to create a profitable and sustainable supply chain.Stage 2: Sourcing The Raw Materials\\nTo begin, here are the steps and processes involved in manufacturing goods:\\nThe next logical step is to choose the most optimal production plan and decide how your supply chain manages:\\nMaterial resource planning – both direct materials and indirect materials\\nPurchasing materials based on seasonal demand calculation\\nManufacturing of goods\\nSetting up assembly points for partially manufactured goods\\nSetting up pricing\\nDelivery planning\\nSetting up payment policies, procedures, and processes with suppliers\\nSetting up negotiating contracts with suppliers and carrier companies\\nCreating quality control metrics by regulating traceability\\nStage 3: Manufacturing Goods and Packaging Into Products\\nNow that we’ve figured out sourcing raw materials and resource planning, it’s time to add value to the raw materials.This process is called manufacturing.Manufacturing and delivering a product on time, within the allotted budget is the number one goal at this stage.As time goes on and technology advances, manufacturing systems and processes are becoming more and more complex.Let’s look at this example: In the 18th and 19th centuries, the industrial revolution transformed economies because of the well-established relationship between customers and suppliers.In fact, The National Academy Press quotes:\\n“By 1920, well-developed relationships between customers and suppliers facilitated the emergence of ‘mass production.’” \\nAnd as we speak, mass production is at an all-time high.This brings us to the million-dollar question.Is it possible to manage such large-scale production units and complex supply chain management systems seamlessly?The answer is yes.Modern supply chains strive for tracking and reducing redundant supply chain steps and having more control over the manufacturing and operations processes.And they achieve this using business intelligence and advanced AI technology.Quick note: A logistics intelligence system helps you tap into your supply chain’s mind and control its matter.Take proactive steps to optimize your modern supply chain operations by getting a complete overview of your business that saves you money.Request a free demo here.Stage 4: Delivery and Logistics\\nReducing product defects, increasing production efficiency, and delivering quality products on time to the customer is the end goal of any supply chain.The process of direct/indirect integration of the products with the consumers happens in the delivery and logistics stage.This can be further classified into the following steps:\\nReceiving orders from customers\\nEstablishing a network of warehouses\\nChoosing logistics partners to deliver the product\\nCollaborating with 3PLs\\nSetting up an invoicing and payment acceptance system \\nStage 5: Returns, Refunds, and Reverse Logistics\\nThe processes we spoke about up until now are categorized as forward logistics.Because they’re all headed towards the end goal – to deliver a product to the customer.Once the customer files for a return, the processes that are triggered after this point are called reverse logistics.What happens to a product after it’s filed for return?Reverse logistics starts by tracking the products filed for return.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"8M9h08HU8whqnr/SJ0gPJ3pf26JXgdCOEANvKuoUtBY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"680851c9-afb8-42c5-83c2-468355f3fa4d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"680851c9-afb8-42c5-83c2-468355f3fa4d\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipment-costs-carrier-charges/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"471d4f3f-674c-4077-8454-fd595a5ef702\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipment-costs-carrier-charges/\"},\"hash\":\"SpAo65ypmh9ClF50qTT91e80is5LnwdDASrm6aVkiXQ=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"7fe7c6b1-7e11-4425-bd09-850f131594ee\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipment-costs-carrier-charges/\"},\"hash\":\"8M9h08HU8whqnr/SJ0gPJ3pf26JXgdCOEANvKuoUtBY=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"59006391-455f-44ac-917a-eb4e016fb93a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"gadVdiSJBvxDCCiR2Lrpctz5TbJPleJAxs9Qrgm31YE=\"}},\"text\":\"Stage

government\\nThe 5 stages of a supply chain system represent the high-level, big-picture decisions and tactical operational overview you can tap into to optimize your systems.But to optimize your supply chain systems, you should first be able to identify the root causes that slow down the supply chain and contribute to revenue loss.Factors Affecting Supply Chain Performance\\n715 supply chains were surveyed for research, and it was observed that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted 78% of these supply chains.That’s a big number, and it shows how susceptible our supply chain systems are.But, even on an average day, many factors are influencing your profits (or losses):\\nFuel Costs:\\nWith escalating oil prices, logistics costs spiral upward as well.So to get to the root cause, what’s causing a spike in oil prices?Crude oil prices, refining costs, retail distribution, freight and processing charges, excise duty, and dealer commission are some of the factors that contribute to increasing fuel prices.Delayed Shipment Arrival:\\nOut of the scope of delivery partners, shipments can be delayed due to various reasons.Bad weather (caused due to hurricanes, cyclones, etc.), piracy, regional wars, fire hazards, changes in traffic schedules (especially for inland traffic), etc., can cause shipment delays.Other than that, the primary reasons causing delayed shipments leading to increased logistics costs are shortage of containers, vessel space, and ships for transportation, especially after a holiday season.Delayed Delivery:\\nLack of delivery personnel or the unavailability from the end customer can cause delivery delays.In such cases, the product has to be stored in a warehouse.And this leads to an increase in warehouse charges.To reduce warehouse rental charges, several logistics partners prefer cross-docking their product line and deliver the product directly from the supplier to the customer, doing away with warehousing.Government Regulations:\\nRules of international trade are complex.Processing legal permit documents, compliance checks, and contracts add to the extra supply chain costs.Authorities impose these regulations at various levels like federal, state, and local.The anti-idling and other emission reduction regulations can cause a significant increase in annual compliance costs.Let’s look at how we can leverage business intelligence in logistics to track and save these costs.How To Use Logistics Intelligence To Track And Reduce Supply Chain Costs\\nLogistics Intelligence is nothing but supply chains using and simulating human intelligence processes, with the help of machines, to speed up their manufacturing systems, reduce churn, and increase their manufacturing rate efficiently by reducing their manufacturing cycles to a fraction.Let’s look at an example.Cisco is one of the largest and best supply chains in the world.In Gartner’s 2021 report, Cisco was rated the best supply chain leader for the second consecutive year.These rankings were based on the resilience, agility, and sustainability of the supply chains.What did these companies do differently to thrive during a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic?They adopted the digital-first approach and employed business intelligence to automate and speed up the processes that require little to no maintenance, hence saving them millions of dollars in costs.A survey of boards of directors taken late in 2020 showed that nearly 70% of companies accelerated their digital roadmaps, as compared to the beginning of the year.Let’s look at the

by analyzing network hubs, bottlenecks, warehouses, and other logistics elements\\nOverall, logistics Intelligence helps a business improve its decision-making process with real-time, accurate data.Business intelligence tools convert data into digestible chunks of information and represent the information visually to help with faster decision-making.How To Use Logistics Intelligence To Optimize Supply Chain Processes\\nDiverse goals and disconnected processes in large value chains make end-to-end optimization challenging.Logistics Intelligence brings independent supply chain processes and unifies them to work as one integrated unit to achieve its end goals and enhance supply chain visibility.Let’s look at how to use this visibility to build agile supply chain companies.How to Leverage Reporting in Logistics Intelligence To Build Faster Supply Chains\\nHaving easy access to detailed reports with transport provider’s data, including metrics like weight, package dimensions, expected delivery time, tender acceptance rate, etc., solves half the worries.It makes tracking supply chain systems more accurate and faster.Logistics Dashboard reports can be generated instantly.Visualization tools like these sync the objectives together and bring clarity to crucial economic decisions and opportunities.Unlike traditional data mining methods, there’s no more waiting for weeks and months to study current trends and understand supply chain operations.How to Use Real-Time Dashboards To Grow Your Supply Chain Business\\nInstantaneous data is the driving force behind robust, agile supply chains because they dramatically decrease monotonous human effort and save tons of time spent on mining voluminous data.Let’s take an example of a mining plant.In case of a crisis like shortage of workers or regional connectivity, real-time data equips you with quick reaction time and ensures safety before it’s too late.Similarly, let’s say a package is delayed due to freight arrival delay.If all the tracking data were left trusted with the 3PL or freight services like UPS or FedEx, you wouldn’t really know what’s happening with the freight cargo until there was a barrage of complaints from angry customers.To avoid such an emergency, you could get ahead of your next action step with real-time tracking.If the freight cargo is getting delayed, dashboard data conveys that to you immediately.You can communicate with your customers beforehand and inform them of the causes of the delay and avoid bad reviews that hamper your brand’s reputation and cost you profits in the long run.How to Optimize Supply Chains and Reduce Carrier Charges\\nThe pandemic has triggered the eCommerce boom like never before.High consumer goods demand has resulted in container shortages and soaring freight cargo charges.Global shipping rates have seen a record spike in recent months.According to Freightos, the cost to ship a container from China to the U.S.East Coast in November was a shocking $4,750.It cost 42% less in July 2020.At this rate, soaring container charges can prove to be a huge impediment to supply chain companies.And the numbers are not going down anytime soon.But, there is a way to reduce carrier costs.Let’s look at some cost optimization strategies:\\nOptimize Carrier Miles and Reduce Transportation Costs\\nTransportation cost amounts to a significant number in overall supply chain spending.Unfortunately, this cost is passed onto the customers.Product costs keep increasing, leading to decreased customer retention rate – and a reduction in revenue and profits.However, here’s how we can tackle rising transportation costs.Use Fewer Carriers to Reduce Dead Miles\\nHaving multiple carriers often gives good service.But if larger loads are assigned to a single carrier vendor, there is a possibility to lower rates across all routes.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"dxhoftl6/zub3WpOuULdC9veCcTOos+hacGX1yFycTI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ad8ad72e-8ed0-4e00-8a2d-797c8daf41cd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ad8ad72e-8ed0-4e00-8a2d-797c8daf41cd\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipment-costs-carrier-charges/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"471d4f3f-674c-4077-8454-fd595a5ef702\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipment-costs-carrier-charges/\"},\"hash\":\"SpAo65ypmh9ClF50qTT91e80is5LnwdDASrm6aVkiXQ=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"59006391-455f-44ac-917a-eb4e016fb93a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipment-costs-carrier-charges/\"},\"hash\":\"gadVdiSJBvxDCCiR2Lrpctz5TbJPleJAxs9Qrgm31YE=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"1b76f08d-8689-4e4a-b149-ff4d03b65020\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"G7K2BVPX8h6SNx9l0Zu3nXFzL1ebRLfrtCIfAPeKjeU=\"}},\"text\":\"According

keep increasing, leading to decreased customer retention rate – and a reduction in revenue and profits.However, here’s how we can tackle rising transportation costs.Use Fewer Carriers to Reduce Dead Miles\\nHaving multiple carriers often gives good service.But if larger loads are assigned to a single carrier vendor, there is a possibility to lower rates across all routes.Not all individual routes will cost less than other carriers.However, if one considers all the routes and calculates the total cost, such an arrangement will work out to be cheaper.The manufacturers can outline their requirements, roll out a quotation request, and evaluate different bidders for the job.Having long-term contracts with carriers gives them time to shape up an efficient network with minimal or no dead miles, resulting in savings up to 3-5%.A contract for a longer duration also means locked-in rates, which otherwise may go up every year.Load Boarding or Feight Boarding Can Save Costs\\nImagine there’s a truck driver stationed in Kansas after a full load delivery from Georgia.He’s done his job, and now it’s time to head back home.But he’ll be clocking an empty load – which is a massive loss for small business owners like him.Now, he has two options:\\nA.Head back home with an empty truckload and uncompensated miles.B.Look for a return load on freight marketplace and maximize his profits by reducing downtime.The latter option is a win-win for three logistics parties here – supply chain companies looking for carriers, truck drivers looking for load boards, and third-party carriers connecting supply chains with truck drivers.For a supply chain company, having a load board for a one-off shipment can fetch you lower rates, especially if they are carried as backhauls.And sometimes, carriers may be ready to charge only fuel costs and a little extra for such loads to avoid empty miles cost.Have a Steady Volume Contract to Reduce Recurring Charges\\nIf you have a steady flow of freight for a repeat destination, the carrier can market and book return freight trips.Hence reducing the transportation cost significantly.The added advantage is the priority given to suppliers who have regular freight volumes.This is especially beneficial on days with tight transport capacity.You not only save in recurring carrier costs, but you’ll also save the extra costs that may incur during high-demand seasons.Optimum Inventory Storage Reduces Variable Costs\\nFor cost-effective operations, inventory should be replenished to an optimum number, consistently.Now, why have an inventory stock?To reduce supplier lead time and deliver products on time as and when the orders chime in.Optimum stocking also means measuring and expecting order capacity to avoid overstocking, which results in losses.Some of the factors to consider while calculating optimum inventory levels include:\\nDemand variability\\nManufacturing time\\nTransportation time\\nDelivery lead time\\nQuick Tip: The safe amount of inventory is the quantity of goods/raw material that doesn’t affect the manufacturing cycle due to shortage of material or cost more for storage.Reducing Sourcing and Storing costs\\nFinding a supplier who not only supplies raw material but also stores it until the raw material procurement requests begin is a smart way to reduce warehousing costs.This is called an Integrated Supply Chain System.Contracting a single vendor for all logistics and transportation requirements can allow manufacturers to negotiate and reduce overall costs.The manufacturers can outline their requirements and roll out a request for quotation and evaluate annual contracts for efficient management.This system is called Single Sourcing, and it saves the manufacturer tons of time and money.Because there is no need to solicit and review bids from a variety of suppliers every single time there’s a transport request, it saves months in man-hours and hence reduces costs.Consolidating Shipments\\nIt is cost-effective to consolidate shipments to make Full container load (FCL) or Truckload (TL) going in the same direction.The other advantage of FCL or TL is that carriers load goods according to your specifications.This reduces the chance of custom delays in case other shipments in the container don’t adhere to government regulations.Consolidated larger shipments can give potential savings up to 50% as opposed to smaller shipments.For a small shipment, the shipper may end up paying a huge amount as minimum charges over a period of time.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"HTYRrLcnYo6C+wsgrs9U+c11t5VOuEltxKQ9dPx1oJQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"1b76f08d-8689-4e4a-b149-ff4d03b65020":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1b76f08d-8689-4e4a-b149-ff4d03b65020\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipment-costs-carrier-charges/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"471d4f3f-674c-4077-8454-fd595a5ef702\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipment-costs-carrier-charges/\"},\"hash\":\"SpAo65ypmh9ClF50qTT91e80is5LnwdDASrm6aVkiXQ=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"ad8ad72e-8ed0-4e00-8a2d-797c8daf41cd\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipment-costs-carrier-charges/\"},\"hash\":\"q+YKML60yruZV1FAeA94G8REgYqmRyzkm32HvRv5jYg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"9a433948-5840-4317-bd64-07c519b211d5\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"jk60ByFR5obThn4J6DbuKe+1kA50Oi0j/38L+IBibHs=\"}},\"text\":\"The

freight savings with the retailer may influence the retailer to book larger shipments.Also, incentivizing larger shipments is not only cheaper, it’s sustainable.When FCL or TL is not possible, then it is economical to consolidate shipment of size Less than Truckload (LTL) or LCL (Less than a Container Load) of one or more suppliers going towards the same destination.Minimize Touch-Points\\nBig chain retailers procure their merchandise directly from manufacturers.As much as possible, individual merchandise should be touched only when a consumer buys it off the rack to reduce manpower and warehousing costs.But how do you decide what logistics strategy applies right now for the current situation?This is where logistics intelligence helps you map out current events and trends and derive the right information needed to pull out of an emergency/crisis quickly.Arriving at an optimum inventory number depending on season and demand is impossible without a logistics intelligence system that displays historical trends and showcases supply chain behavior in a visual format.Here’s how eSigns.com saved $375,000 in 12 months using Sifted’s LI platform.Request a free demo

Costs Annually\\nMajor shipping carriers like FedEx and UPS announce a yearly increase in shipping rates of about 4 to 6%, known as the General Rate Increase (GRI).Shipping surcharges are also included in the GRI.Moreover, the increase in shipping fees is not uniform through service levels.For example, there might be a 4.5% increase in ground shipping, but a 5.5% increase may apply to express mail.Similarly, carriers charge different additional handling surcharges for each shipping zone.As you can imagine, the uneven shipping rate distribution directly affects the profitability of the shippers.In this article, we look at the best ways to effectively manage shipping cost changes and save money for your business.Are shipping charges catching you off guard?Gain full visibility into your supply chain operations with Sifted’s Logistics Intelligence solutions.Peak Season Shipping Checklist\\nDownload Now\\n7 Solutions You Can Implement to Reduce Shipping Costs\\nIf shippers are not careful, the regular rise in shipping costs can destroy their bottom line.These rate changes affect your shipping spend just as much as other factors like shipping distance, DIM weight, and taxes.Let’s look at some ways you can reduce costs and protect your business from carrier rate changes.1.Consider outsourcing portions of order fulfillment to a 3PL.Fulfilling all your orders from the same location gets expensive when you factor in the shipping across multiple shipping zones.Carriers charge higher fees for shipping to customers living in higher shipping zones.This means you either absorb the cost of shipping and reduce your profit margins or make your customers pay for them and risk losing sales.By outsourcing portions of your inventory to a third-party logistics company, you can fulfill customer orders from fulfillment centers located closer to their geographic location.This helps speed up delivery times, reduce shipping costs, and save on your own warehouse space.3PLs manage and fulfill a large number of orders each month.Sheer economies of scale gives them access to lower prices on everything including packaging supplies, so they pass on these cost savings to their customers.Similarly, 3PLs can provide you with lower rates because they can negotiate volume discounts from carriers due to their large shipping volume.2.Weigh packages and reduce dimensions.Package dimensions and weight are two critical factors that affect the shipping fees charged by carriers.Optimizing your packaging can help you reduce the cost of shipping and boost your profit margins.Whether you take the packages to the post office yourself or schedule pick up at your location, you should measure the weight and dimensions of your package beforehand, and attach the right shipping label.Sometimes a 1-2 pound weight difference results in double the shipping cost.Using a postage scale and tape measure, you’ll get closer to an accurate estimate of the shipping costs and avoid any unexpected fees and surcharges.Most major carriers use the higher of the actual weight and dimensional weight to calculate the shipping rates.The dimensional weight takes into account the space occupied by your package to determine the shipping cost.This means that using a large box to pack a relatively smaller product could lead to higher shipping fees than if you would use the right box size to compactly pack your products.A good rule of thumb is to measure the actual and dimensional weight of the product and packaging, especially if you sell products that are lightweight and large in size.If their dimensional weight is more than the actual weight, you should consider designing custom boxes that match the size and shape of your products.This option is particularly helpful if you sell such products in high volume.Similarly, you can reduce package dimensions and weight by using lightweight packaging materials like bubble wrap, air pillows, and foam inserts.Corrugated boxes are also a lighter alternative to cardboard boxes and offer more impact resistance.3.Offer a flat rate shipping fee to all customers.FedEx and UPS increased their shipping fees by an average of 5.9%, and USPS hiked rates by an average of 2.7%.And when you factor in surcharges, the shipping process becomes more complicated for both shippers and customers.In contrast, flat rate shipping offers the simplest pricing system as you charge the same shipping fees regardless of the order size and weight.This option is only feasible, though, if your products are similar in weight and size (e.g.cosmetics products), or if most of your customers order similar quantities (e.g.subscription boxes).You can encourage your customers to order within a specific weight or quantity range to qualify for discounted flat rates.Alternatively, you can use flat rate boxes provided by your shipping carriers to mail your packages.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"8XSTeHeq5tZ0Oe3aA4WHEmx3pMdN9zvqaEL26Fxuh98=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6b14edd2-18e5-4d56-b9d7-1eb2c7958b77":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6b14edd2-18e5-4d56-b9d7-1eb2c7958b77\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"5043e683-9692-4973-bbe0-3a9d745948c0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"sg7BW/K2+iNTSpupBvC6Y5xZFMhmZZ7pyRk8nN0gotk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"34c76145-1813-4d8d-8463-38a232f87aef\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"8XSTeHeq5tZ0Oe3aA4WHEmx3pMdN9zvqaEL26Fxuh98=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"0b418bc6-133b-403f-b8cb-2d4bede9099b\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"B8OI7W3t2/s9sfukRfZiJmjjO5YY79f4JE0RhMxv3FY=\"}},\"text\":\"Corrugated

shippers don’t have to worry about any surprises.Are shipping mistakes slipping past your glance?Take better charge of your shipping costs to avoid mistakes with Sifted’s Logistics Intelligence solutions.4.Look into offers from platforms and marketplaces you sell on.An effective way to save money is to outsource your shipping to Amazon, AliExpress, or a similar shipping solution.It may seem like a costly option, but it lets you cut down on other expenses such as hiring workers, warehousing and storage, and order processing.Plus, Amazon offers free 2-day shipping, enabling shippers to delight their customers with fast delivery times.This option is only available, however, if you are selling on these platforms.Amazon Prime Day also provides a great opportunity for retailers to offer free shipping to Prime members.It lets them select a day of the week to receive all their orders.Similarly, Amazon offers discounted rates to eligible sellers for LTL and FTL shipments.Etsy is another useful eCommerce shipping option for small businesses that want to keep costs low.It lets you create and print shipping labels online and even offers order tracking to your customers.5.Keep an eye on shipping carriers’ pricing changes.Shipping carriers like UPS and FedEx announce a change in shipping charges on a yearly basis known as the General Rate Increase (GRI).This pricing change is the adjustment of shipping rates depending on the requirements of demand and supply chain in the shipping industry and increased prices of fuel and labor.In addition to the base shipping rates, carriers also change their surcharges (e.g.fuel surcharges).However, you can still negotiate discounted rates, especially if you have a high shipping volume with your carrier.The implication of an annual rate increase for shippers and eCommerce store owners is that they might need to adjust the prices of their products to protect their bottom line.Carrier price changes along with different shipping options and shipping zones make shipping parcels more complex.Sifted’s software helps businesses stay on top of carrier rate changes and optimize parcel shipping costs.6.Choose the right packaging.The weight and size of your package greatly impacts the total shipping cost.One of the most effective ways to target lower rates is to use alternative packing materials like poly mailers instead of cardboard boxes.Cardboard packaging is heavy, and using lightweight poly mailer bags to ship packages helps you cut down on package weight.Similarly, cardboard box sizes are fixed, meaning its package dimensions decide the shipping costs even if there is empty space inside.In contrast, poly mailer bags are compact, making them more cost-effective than cardboard boxes for shipping non-fragile items like sweaters and pillows.Another great way to lower shipping costs is to use packing supplies provided by your shipping carrier.Major carriers like FedEx, USPS, and DHL offer discounted packing materials to small retail stores and eCommerce businesses.In fact, USPS Priority Mail customers get better rates (along with shipping insurance) when they use the carrier’s shipping supplies compared to using their own packaging.Experienced shippers know that buying packing materials like boxes, poly mailers, and dunnage in bulk achieves cost savings in the long run.Each unit cost reduces for each parcel when you buy packaging in bulk quantity.7.Utilize a logistics intelligence tool.When you self-fulfilling orders, you usually spend a lot of time receiving and processing orders.As a result, you have less clarity about the effects of shipment cost trends on your business.A logistics intelligence tool gives you access to data analytics and automation tools that help you identify opportunities for cost savings.It lets you compare and analyze different shipment scenarios to understand true fulfillment costs.With this information, you’ll can optimize your logistics budget, and drive supply chain performance while substantially reducing your costs.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"G3yWAbTP6M4O0FHqCfsak9tlDIiW9LmI4D0jaLYkL50=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0b418bc6-133b-403f-b8cb-2d4bede9099b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0b418bc6-133b-403f-b8cb-2d4bede9099b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"5043e683-9692-4973-bbe0-3a9d745948c0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"sg7BW/K2+iNTSpupBvC6Y5xZFMhmZZ7pyRk8nN0gotk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"6b14edd2-18e5-4d56-b9d7-1eb2c7958b77\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://sifted.com/resources/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"8xjPkX9TgtmgqbGvMF8LPXS/+j+qQj41b8d+pqfc0QE=\"}},\"text\":\"In

and Sifted Merge to Offer First and Only Predictive Analytics Platform for Logistics\\nMerger creates a new model to optimize transportation spend management for shippers overwhelmed by historic shipping volumes and soaring costs\\nOctober 27, 2020 10:21 AM Eastern Daylight Time\\nKANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VeriShip, the nation’s leading shipping expense optimization platform, today announced a merger with Sifted, provider of the leading data science-driven predictive logistics platform.The merger joins two market leaders to create a transformational cloud-based analytics engine for logistics.The combined company serves thousands of shippers across all sizes and complexities.“We are giving shippers the clarity, control and freedom they need to forecast and proactively manage shipping costs.”Post this\\nVeriShip and Sifted bring together the country’s largest independent shipping expense database and the industry’s first cloud native, automated simulation and optimization platform.The new platform dramatically reduces transportation expenses for shippers while optimizing for delivery times and best-in-class customer experience.The combined company is backed by global growth equity investor Summit Partners, which invested in VeriShip in 2018.This marks the second transaction for VeriShip in the last year, following its acquisition of Valence in December, 2019.VeriShip and Sifted’s clients range from small and medium business, such as Simple Tire and Chicago Music Exchange to enterprise-level organizations like Shutterfly, Boston Scientific, and Kendra Scott.The combination creates a new model for managing transportation spend — one that brings together the power of self-service technology and transportation data science to help shippers navigate an increasingly complex shipping environment fueled by dramatic e-commerce growth.The companies will merge capabilities under the Sifted brand, and all clients will migrate to the new platform and will gain immediate access to easy-to-understand, 360-degree analytics of their data.“For most businesses today, especially those in e-commerce, it is impossible to make data-driven decisions.Shippers are constantly blindsided by carrier changes, and they’re expected to fulfill shipments on time, implement new systems, manage inventory problems, and improve efficiencies, all while keeping costs in check.Now, with the combined power of VeriShip’s data set and Sifted’s predictive modeling capabilities, our platform will prescribe actions and prevent unnecessary spending before it ever happens,” said VeriShip Chief Executive Officer Shawn McCarrick.Effective today, the companies will integrate business operations to create the most capable team in the industry.Shawn McCarrick will lead the company as CEO.Sifted’s three co-founders, Adam Moulding, Mark Chamberlain and Caleb Nelson, will serve as Chief Operating Officer, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Revenue Officer, respectively.VeriShip’s George Meier will jointly lead sales as Chief Business Development Officer alongside Nelson.All other existing business leaders in both organizations remain and will continue serving in critical roles.“The Sifted platform enables shippers to move away from educated guessing to decisions based on data science and provides highly accurate predictions using software for optimization and modeling,” said Adam Moulding, the new entity’s Chief Operating Officer.“We are giving shippers the clarity, control and freedom they need to forecast and proactively manage shipping costs.”About VeriShip\\nVeriShip is the nation’s largest spend management and payments platform that tracks and analyzes shipping data to reduce costs for small and midsize businesses shipping packages throughout the U.S.Its platform gives clients control and clarity into their shipping data with a single source of visibility into transportation spend.Since 2005, VeriShip has helped over 5,000 businesses optimize shipping expenses on nearly 1.5 billion packages.Learn more at www.veriship.com.\\nAbout Sifted\\nSifted is the number one choice of enterprise-grade shippers in the nation
