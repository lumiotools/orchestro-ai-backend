Glīd’s technology aims to revolutionize first-mile logistics and intermodal operations.\nOne of Glīd’s key advantages is its ability to eliminate multiple material handling steps in the logistics process, potentially reducing carbon emissions and improving efficiency.\nBeyond logistics innovation, Glīd has a strong social mission. The company plans to create jobs in marginalized communities near ports and rail yards, offering training and employment opportunities without requiring formal education. This approach aims to provide economic mobility and inspire future generations.\nLooking ahead, Glīd aims to democratize first-mile transportation, starting in the United States with plans to expand globally. Their goal is to improve logistics efficiency, reduce costs, and positively impact communities adjacent to ports and rail yards, potentially contributing to lower consumer prices and an improved quality of life.\n\n\nChapters\n0:00 Military Service\n0:53 Inspiration for Glīd\n1:39 Glīd Weight Restrictions\n3:21 Maintaining Glīd\n4:25 Job Creation\n7:45 Glīd Target Markets\n9:07 Glīd System\n19:54 Road to Rail Transition\n24:02 Railroads\n25:04 Regulatory\n26:43 State of Glīd’s Technology\n28:13 SpaceX Manufacturing\n29:30 Romeo Power\n31:32 Future of Glīd\n\n\n--------\nAbout The Road to Autonomy\nThe Road to Autonomy® is a leading source of data, insight and commentary on autonomous vehicles/trucks and the emerging autonomy economy™.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":3152,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"o/Y9LZKEfuxZgG130GZt7A/2kq20OinCd/PTKoqfcm4="},"0c6b87b8-6278-48d5-8be2-b30a38ff5912":{"id_":"0c6b87b8-6278-48d5-8be2-b30a38ff5912","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ivoox.com/episode-219-autonomous-rail-to-road-vehicles-audios-mp3_rf_132542041_1.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"71516cb2-304a-4ad0-a357-729ea8270590","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ivoox.com/episode-219-autonomous-rail-to-road-vehicles-audios-mp3_rf_132542041_1.html"},"hash":"+/nxmpFVP8Dce74PEkM//atByzFCUyQB+jedtMdaVKg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"52b472a8-629c-4a2a-84f4-116b1a07f1ae","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ivoox.com/episode-219-autonomous-rail-to-road-vehicles-audios-mp3_rf_132542041_1.html"},"hash":"7H14otI6hGvcTUimTUrR0dXaorP9ehiEiHHpElFEpyM="}},"text":"Chapters\n0:00 Military Service\n0:53 Inspiration for Glīd\n1:39 Glīd Weight Restrictions\n3:21 Maintaining Glīd\n4:25 Job Creation\n7:45 Glīd Target Markets\n9:07 Glīd System\n19:54 Road to Rail Transition\n24:02 Railroads\n25:04 Regulatory\n26:43 State of Glīd’s Technology\n28:13 SpaceX Manufacturing\n29:30 Romeo Power\n31:32 Future of Glīd\n\n\n--------\nAbout The Road to Autonomy\nThe Road to Autonomy® is a leading source of data, insight and commentary on autonomous vehicles/trucks and the emerging autonomy economy™.\n\n\nSign up for This Week in The Autonomy Economy newsletter:\nSee Privacy Policy at and California Privacy Notice at .\nView more\nautonomous truck self-driving trucks the road to autonomy mobility markets Self-Driving Truck\nComments of Episode 219 | Autonomous Rail to Road Vehicles\n\nThis program does not accept anonymous comments. !Sign up to comment!\nNo comments yet.

Today’s episode is entitled “The Wine World of the Future - demographic and consumption scenarios” and features Carlo Flamini, Marzia Varvaglione, Filippo Polegato and Andrea Andreoli.\n\n\nItalian Wine Podcast is proud to be a media partner of wine2wine Business Forum and is pleased to present this series of market-focus sessions, recorded in Verona in November 2023.\n\n\nwine2wine Business Forum is an international wine business event held annually in Verona, Italy since 2014. The event is a key reference point for wine producers and wine professionals from around the world, providing an opportunity to network, develop and expand their wine business worldwide.\n\n\nAbout the session:\n\n\nThis session compares the past, present and future for a sector that will rest its growth less and less on marketed volumes. The Observatory of Unione Italiana Vini takes stock of today’s more rapid evolution of consumption and its impact on the Italian wine business. \n\n\nAbout the hosts:\nModerator Andrea Andreoli\nIn 1991 he began writing for Il Nuovo Veronese, which back then was a daily newspaper. The following year he began collaborating with Telenuovo TV as well. In 1993 he was among the founders of the station’s Padua editorial office and, from the beginning of 1994, he became its editor-in-chief. In January 2001 he returned to the Verona headquarters as Deputy Editor. In May 2019 he was appointed Chief Editor of Telenuovo Tg Verona. \n\n\nFilippo Polegato\nFilippo is 32 years old and represents the fourth generation of a family engaged in the wine business. After graduating from high school, he worked in the industry, between Australia and the U.S., later taking care of the commercial department and sponsorship management in Astoria. As CEO, he has invested in improving production and logistics efficiency, energy optimization solutions, growth in foreign markets, and the promotion of wine and food tourism.\n\n\nMarzia Varvaglione\nMarzia joined her family business in 2013. Varvaglione 1921 was known for bulk wine. Today Varvaglione 1921 exports 5 million bottles to more than 70 countries. A member of the Le Donne del Vino association, Marzia Varvaglione was elected President of AGIVI in 2023. She continues to play an important role in the family winery as well as on the national wine scene.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":3909,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NNaNJDICRL4b1Mi1fxk2NMBx6LDkqBh+ZSViV3zun2c="},"0c430dc6-e502-4bd8-88ae-17a6c9ca4927":{"id_":"0c430dc6-e502-4bd8-88ae-17a6c9ca4927","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ivoox.com/ep-2131-the-wine-world-of-the-future-audios-mp3_rf_134953295_1.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"d135fc18-2eb6-4844-b277-2de4b0377aa8","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ivoox.com/ep-2131-the-wine-world-of-the-future-audios-mp3_rf_134953295_1.html"},"hash":"GB8mOcNHcYB4w7Yv+JmqDAu0qPVUIfmErg1+ibRkLhQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"309e2e1f-8113-4590-84a2-3a8aac87a082","metadata":{"url":"https://www.ivoox.com/ep-2131-the-wine-world-of-the-future-audios-mp3_rf_134953295_1.html"},"hash":"EGLpJMtOc1zhpJnHTRH/N/eyvy8mtd1gEvvAm20mFd0="}},"text":"Filippo Polegato\nFilippo is 32 years old and represents the fourth generation of a family engaged in the wine business.
