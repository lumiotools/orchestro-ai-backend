Typical behavior from lasership. The absolute very worst shipping company with a bunch of thieves working for them. I have had 4 orders in the past 2 or so years that were sent with them (I ALWAYS cancel my order if I am lucky enough to notice they are the shipper before the order is \\\"delivered\\\") and 3 of them had issues. They would say something was delivered but wouldn't be there. 2 times I was home and neither time was the doorbell rang. Then, of course, no package would be anywhere around. Once I checked within 2 min of the \\\"delivery\\\" notification, no ring at the bell and no package. Now I see why that happens. A ring bell very close by to where I live caught a dirty son of a piece of garbage mother stealing packages he was supposed to be delivering. You think this is his first time, or he figured out how to do this by himself? He isn't even smart enough not to steal on camera while working with his face all in the video, he is definitely way too stupid to have came up with even a smooth brained scheme like this on his own. Cancel your order if you see it being shipped by losership and order elsewhere! Even if it's a few dollars more expensive, at least you'll actually get your item and it won't be in a pawn shop because some deadbeat scumbag like the thing in the video hocked it for 10 bucks for weed money while his baby is crying starving somewhere.\\n\\n\\nShow more\\nComment\\nThank you\\nRespond as company\\nHelpful \\n(2)\\nG K.\\nWashington\\n1 review 3 helpful votes\\nIf I could give 0 stars, I would\\nApril 18th, 2024 Verified purchase\\nLasership does not follow delivery instructions provided by the vendor I purchased from—instructions that get printed on the shipping label. I live a quarter of a mile from my USPS mailbox which is located at the entrance to my neighborhood and is at the side of a busy highway. Lasership delivered a large (2'x1'x1') package containing perishable food (in a box prominently labeled as PERISHABLE) to my USPS mailbox instead of to my residence in 85+ degree weather and marked my order as delivered. My delivery instructions requested pkg be placed at my back door which is the only side of my house in the shade and protected from rain. I checked all around my house and later at the mailbox and found nothing. The vendor re-shipped my order for free but insisted on using Lasership again despite the original misdelivery. Fortunately this time I was able to retrieve the $200+ pkg before someone else decided to help themselves to it. Every other shipping company—Fed Ex, UPS, DHL, and even USPS—deliver large packages directly to my residence. Lasership is providing a huge disservice to businesses and their customers who depend on reliable and competent delivery.\\nShow more\\nComment\\nThank you\\nRespond as company\\nHelpful \\n(3)\\ncynthia K.\\nFlorida\\n1 review 2 helpful votes\\nHORRIBLE\\nApril 16th, 2024\\nI HAVE LOST 3 PACKAGES IN A MONTH THAT WERE TO BE DELIVERED BY THESE FRAUDS.

I never have good service with leadership. Most the time they don't delivery to the correct address. This time the guy actually did delivery to the correct home but first of all, he showed up at 2:50 AM. Who does that? I have a husband, me, a dog, and a newborn baby. You don't show up at someone's house at 2:50 am. Not only that, you could hear him slamming his car door multiple times, he just threw the package on the porch.

Why? Because they didn't have a gate code. My neighborhood is not a gated community, there are no gate codes to access anywhere in this neighborhood. Had to wait an HOUR to speak to customer service, only for customer service rep Jeremiah to disconnect from me and send an email saying he \\\"submitted the information for review\\\". Next customer service rep said they were going to \\\"look into it.\\\" None of these resolve the issue, as this driver clearly just didn't feel like finishing their route and marked my package as \\\"gate code needed.\\\" It's actually infuriating, especially after the package was delayed for 3 days extra already while being held by LaserShip.

Typical behavior from lasership. The absolute very worst shipping company with a bunch of thieves working for them. I have had 4 orders in the past 2 or so years that were sent with them (I ALWAYS cancel my order if I am lucky enough to notice they are the shipper before the order is \\\"delivered\\\") and 3 of them had issues. They would say something was delivered but wouldn't be there. 2 times I was home and neither time was the doorbell rang. Then, of course, no package would be anywhere around. Once I checked within 2 min of the \\\"delivery\\\" notification, no ring at the bell and no package. Now I see why that happens. A ring bell very close by to where I live caught a dirty son of a piece of garbage mother stealing packages he was supposed to be delivering. You think this is his first time, or he figured out how to do this by himself? He isn't even smart enough not to steal on camera while working with his face all in the video, he is definitely way too stupid to have came up with even a smooth brained scheme like this on his own. Cancel your order if you see it being shipped by losership and order elsewhere! Even if it's a few dollars more expensive, at least you'll actually get your item and it won't be in a pawn shop because some deadbeat scumbag like the thing in the video hocked it for 10 bucks for weed money while his baby is crying starving somewhere.Show more\\nComment\\nThank you\\nRespond as company\\nHelpful \\n(2)\\nG K.Washington\\n1 review 3 helpful votes\\nIf I could give 0 stars, I

not follow delivery instructions provided by the vendor I purchased from—instructions that get printed on the shipping label.I live a quarter of a mile from my USPS mailbox which is located at the entrance to my neighborhood and is at the side of a busy highway.Lasership delivered a large (2'x1'x1') package containing perishable food (in a box prominently labeled as PERISHABLE) to my USPS mailbox instead of to my residence in 85+ degree weather and marked my order as delivered.My delivery instructions requested pkg be placed at my back door which is the only side of my house in the shade and protected from rain.I checked all around my house and later at the mailbox and found nothing.The vendor re-shipped my order for free but insisted on using Lasership again despite the original misdelivery.Fortunately this time I was able to retrieve the $200+ pkg before someone else decided to help themselves to it.Every other shipping company—Fed Ex, UPS, DHL, and even USPS—deliver large packages directly to my residence.Lasership is providing a huge disservice to businesses and their customers who depend on reliable and competent delivery.Show

they use Laser Ship which I wish I had known because I wouldn't have ordered.I never have good service with leadership.Most the time they don't delivery to the correct address.This time the guy actually did delivery to the correct home but first of all, he showed up at 2:50 AM.Who does that?I have a husband, me, a dog, and a newborn baby.You don't show up at someone's house at 2:50 am.Not only that, you could hear him slamming his car door multiple times, he just threw the package on the porch.Had something glass been in there, it probably would have broke.And then left it sitting out in the rain when I have a covered porch.Literally makes no sense at

for the delivery.Apparently the idiot driver could not figure out that he was on the East side of town and my house is located on the west side of town.I'm assuming he got frustrated by not being able to locate my address so this genius decided the best solution was to dump my package next to a dumpster at a construction company and report it as being delivered\\n5 days later this wonderful woman named Jenny, that worked there saw my package and went on a mission to find me and get it to me.I am so thankful to her, her daughter and everyone at Shirley & Sons Construction Co.,Inc.
