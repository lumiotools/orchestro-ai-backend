Earlier, buyers had to physically go from dealership to dealership, comparing models and negotiating prices; now, much of the process can be done online. \\nThis evolution to online car buying has revolutionised the auto industry. In the section below, we'll discuss how online car buying transforms the auto industry.\\nThe Evolution of Car Buying: Traditional vs Online\\nTraditionally, buying a car meant heading to local dealerships, test-driving various models, and haggling face-to-face over vehicle prices and financing terms. Information was limited to what individual sales associates provided, making it hard for buyers to compare different makes and models. The paperwork and financial arrangements were handled onsite before driving home your new vehicle.\\nIn contrast, online car buying allows you to research cars from desktop or mobile devices on your own time. You can browse inventory across a wide geographic area, view 360-degree interior tours and video test drives, and compare pricing and specs side-by-side. When ready to buy, you can select models you want, apply for financing, estimate payments, fill out paperwork, and even have your vehicle delivered to your doorstep.  \\nKey Benefits of Online Car Buying\\nThe benefits of buying a car from an online platform are mentioned below:\\n  1. Convenience and Time Savings\\nA major perk is the convenience of researching and buying from home or anywhere. There is no need to schedule trips across town to different dealers during work hours. Online buying saves huge amounts of time.\\n2. Broader Selection \\nSearching dealer online inventories opens up options across a whole region rather than just one lot. This means more choices in terms of makes, model configurations, and colours.\\n3. Transparent Pricing\\nOnline listings display pricing, allowing savvy shoppers to compare vehicle prices more easily across dealers. With traditional dealerships, buyers had to negotiate with individual salespeople to learn “bottom-level” pricing. The transparency of online prices levels the playing field.\\n4. Easy Financing \\nGetting pre-approved financing online is simple. It lets you know your budget before entering negotiations. Online applications through dealer or third-party lending networks streamline the financing process. \\n5. Streamlined Paperwork and Delivery\\nFinalising all paperwork digitally reduces the long, stressful process at the dealership. Online buyers can sign and submit documents electronically to complete purchases. Many dealers now offer home delivery once sales are finalised.\\nHow Online Car Buying is Changing Consumer Behavior  \\nThe convenience and transparency of online car buying is shifting how people research, evaluate and decide on purchasing vehicles:\\nOnline reviews and 360 views replace some in-person research.\\nPricing information and tools create buyer expectations around deals. \\nBuyers prefer no-haggle pricing vs negotiating unfamiliar car pricing models and payments.  \\nMore customers complete the buying journey digitally versus at dealerships.\\nHow to Choose the Right Online Platform for Car Buying\\nHere are some tips for choosing the right online platform for car buying:\\nLook for a user-friendly website with extensive search filters to find your desired vehicles. AckoDrive is one such online platform that one should choose for a smooth car-buying process.\\nCheck if they provide upfront pricing without negotiating with sales staff for quotes. Transparent prices must be there.\\nEnsure their purchase process allows applying for financing online through secure bank networks. Quick loan pre-approvals save time.\\nSee if paperwork can be handled digitally for signing sales documents.\\nLearn about their post-purchase delivery options. Many dealers now offer home delivery within a certain radius of their locations.\\nRead online customer reviews on Google, Facebook and other third-party rating sites. This provides insight into real customer experiences.\\nThe right online car-buying platform makes finding, evaluating and purchasing vehicles transparent, convenient and secure. Following these tips helps buyers choose reputable services.\\nThe Bottom Line\\nThe online auto buying transformation is in full swing, forever changing car shopping habits for convenience, selection and pricing. As online dealerships and buying networks refine the digital purchase process while addressing cybersecurity, more consumers are expected to follow the digital path for their next new car.\\n  carautomobile\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nHow Medical Health Insurance Can Boost Employee Retention in Retail Businesses\\nBY - Guest author\\nNov 21, 2024 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The retail industry in India is booming with MSME startups, and it is becoming more important for such companies to have insurance policies to retain their employees in the long term. Whether you hire an office employee or a work-from-home one, giving them the right perks is essential. The average policy size for retail health insurance in India has grown by almost 48% over the past six years. Rising medical costs and growing demand for policies with broader coverage options among policyholders drive this increase.\\nRetail health insurance provides coverage for both the individual employee and their family. In this kind of insurance, the individual directly buys the insurance through the company. Such policies are personalised to cover their medical plans. \\nHow Medical Health Insurance Attracts Employees\\nProviding medical health insurance is a great way of bonding with employees and keeping them motivated. A few advantages are:\\n●Providing a Healthy Work Culture\\nWhen employees know the perks from the initial days, their chances of having work motivation are higher, which promises a healthy work culture and helps maintain a loyal relationship with the company. The reason is that having medical health insurance is safe for them and their families. Their financial and medical needs would be handled, as health is a serious concern nowadays.\\n●Helps Hire Top Talents\\nA recent survey reveals that Indian companies increasingly include outpatient department (OPD) and preventive healthcare costs in their group insurance plans. The survey highlights a 30-40% rise in adoption rates across healthcare, power, engineering, banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI). Also, providing perks like medical health insurance adds an advantage in the hiring process, as it is an added incentive that helps retain employees. \\n●Flexibility In Premium Plans And Tax Savings\\nTax savings are an important part of a retail business owner's or company's strategic planning. Hence, health insurance is one of the best ways to provide an added advantage to employees and encourage them to seek its benefits. It also helps them plan and save on taxes. Retailer businesses can seek low per-employee premium plans to maintain their cashflows without the tension of investing a large amount at once.\\nIn addition, the company faces a diversity risk within its group plan. This risk is evaluated and factored into the plan, resulting in a lower overall premium cost. For instance, premium rates are typically lower when providing group health insurance.\\nJob Satisfaction And Boosts Morale\\nNowadays, proving compensation isn't enough to ensure stability, but providing additional advantages like the following.\\n●Employees who feel that their well-being is prioritised are likelier to develop a positive, emotional connection to their organisation. These perks often become a factor in employees' commitment, as they see that the company is dedicated to supporting their needs beyond just a paycheck. \\n●When companies invest in benefits that address employees' physical, mental, and emotional well-being, they foster a reciprocal relationship in which employees are more motivated to invest their energy and skills in the company’s goals. \\n●Many employees struggle to maintain a work-life balance due to demanding schedules and the “always-on” culture. Offering flexible work hours, remote work options, or mental health days gives employees the flexibility to address personal needs without feeling guilty about work.\\nTakeaway\\nAny retail owner who wishes to expand their business must have a strong, focused team, which is possible when employees are met. This is only possible by covering their risk to ensure stress-free work. Medical health insurance policies through ACKO help provide mental stability and act as a strategic investment for retail businesses to meet their future goals.\\n  InsuranceEconomy & Policy\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nNavigating Life Insurance Options: A Guide for Indian Retailers\\nBY - Guest author\\nNov 21, 2024 / 8 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Having a life insurance policy is no longer a luxury but a necessity in the current inflationary era. This is especially true for Indian retailers who want to safeguard both their businesses and their families' financial futures. However, the insurance landscape has evolved over the past few years, and understanding the different life insurance options has become crucial for Indian retailers in choosing the right policy. \\nRead on to learn about the various options available in the market and the key benefits of having a life insurance policy. \\nDifferent Life Insurance Options Available for Indian Retailers\\nBelow are the different life insurance policies serving various forms of financial security. Go through the following points to identify the one that suits your needs:\\n●Whole Life Insurance Plan\\nAs the name indicates, a whole life insurance policy is a form of permanent life insurance. It provides coverage for the entire lifetime as long as the premiums are paid. The designated nominees will receive the death benefit in the unfortunate event of the policyholder’s demise within the tenure. Besides, whole life policies generate a \\\"cash value\\\" that accumulates over the policy's life. \\n●Term Insurance \\nTerm insurance provides life coverage for a specified term, such as ten years, twenty years, thirty years, etc. If the insured dies within the coverage period, the death benefit is paid to the beneficiary in a lump sum.\\n●Unit-Linked Insurance Plan\\nUnit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) offer the flexibility to provide higher returns than traditional insurance plans. It is preferable for individuals seeking insurance coverage and investment opportunities. ULIPs offer a lump sum benefit to beneficiaries in the event of the policyholder's death while also allowing for the potential growth of the invested funds during the policyholder's lifetime.\\n●Endowment Insurance Plan\\nEndowment plans provide both financial protection and the opportunity to build wealth. These plans offer coverage for a specific tenure chosen by the policyholder. If the policyholder passes away during the term, the dependents receive the sum assured. However, if the policyholder survives the term, they receive a lump sum, known as the maturity benefit, which adds to their accumulated wealth.\\n●Money Back Insurance Plan\\nA money-back insurance plan is ideal for individuals seeking regular cash flow to meet their financial needs. With this plan, policyholders receive periodic payouts throughout the policy term in addition to the maturity benefit. In the event of the policyholder's death during the term, the nominee will receive the full sum assured. If the policyholder survives the term, they will receive a certain percentage of the sum assured at regular intervals.\\n●Child Insurance Plan\\nA child insurance plan provides life coverage and opportunities to save funds for a child's future needs, such as higher education and potential requirements.\\nHow Can You Select the Right Life Insurance Plan as an Indian Retailer?\\nOpting for the right life insurance plan as a retailer in India is crucial. Here are a few things to consider while choosing a plan: \\n●Evaluate Your Financial Requirements\\nAs a retailer, you must assess your financial obligations in running your business and your family's financial expenses to determine the right coverage amount. \\n●Understand the Purpose of Different Life Insurance Plans\\nDifferent types of life insurance plans serve different purposes and come with various benefits. You must research and explore each option to choose the one that best suits your needs. \\n●Comparison\\nIn today’s digital world, there's no longer a need to visit insurance companies physically. You can easily shortlist various plans from different life insurance providers online. Carefully evaluate coverage options, premiums, and other features to pick the one that aligns with your budget. \\n●Check Out Additional Benefits\\nLife insurance plans come with riders that you can add for enhanced coverage. Learn about the riders offered in your shortlisted plans and choose wisely. Some of the common riders include critical illness, accidental death, and disability income. \\n●Insurers Claim Settlement Ratio\\nWhen selecting an insurance provider, always opt for a company with a high Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR). This ratio reflects the insurer's ability to settle claims. \\n●Seek Expert Advice\\nIt’s also beneficial to consult with an insurance advisor or speak to someone with experience purchasing a life insurance plan. By discussing your personal, business, and family needs, you can choose the right plan that aligns with your goals.\\nThe Bottom Line\\nLife insurance today can offer much more than just financial security. It can be your biggest source of empowerment and peace of mind. When buying a life insurance plan, carefully evaluate your financial requirements to determine the right coverage and include valuable riders based on your needs. Choosing a provider with a high claim settlement ratio is always advisable.\\n  eComerceEconomy & Policy\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nPost-Accident Insurance Check: What You Should Do If Your Bike Insurance Falls Short\\nBY - Guest author\\nNov 15, 2024 / 7 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Having a bike insurance policy is a mandatory requirement for every two-wheeler owner. It is to ensure that your vehicles are financially protected against potential damages. However, there can be unfortunate events like accidents, where you might fall short of your insurance coverage.\\nWhether you are underinsured, your insurance policy is lapsed or your vehicle repair costs more than the coverage you receive, you must be aware enough to deal with such critical situations. Read this blog till the end to learn more in detail.\\nWhat Should You Do If You Fall Short of Your Bike Insurance Coverage?\\nMeeting with an accident when you fall short of your bike insurance check coverage is a traumatic situation. Here are a few points you can consider in case you come across such a circumstance:\\nContact Your Vehicle Insurance Provider\\nWhenever your bike comes across any accidents, the first thing you should do is inform your vehicle insurance provider about the same. The insurance company is then going to verify the authentication of your details and provide you with the necessary financial assistance. \\nHowever, in case the coverage you have purchased is not enough to cover the damages of your two-wheeler, you must convey this to the company and ask for assistance.\\nInsurance companies can provide you with additional coverage only as per their terms and conditions. You need to be transparent with the issue you are facing so that they can offer valuable insights to help you broaden your policy limits.\\nExplore Other Options for Financial Assistance\\nIn case you do not get any additional coverage from your bike insurance provider, you need to now dive into other financial assistance you might have. These include your personal savings, using credit cards etc.\\nYou need to stay calm and try to determine the expenses you have to bear. Accordingly, you can proceed towards making appropriate payment plans or ask for financial help from anyone you know who can help you immediately.\\nNegotiate With the Other Party\\nIf you have got into an accident where another vehicle/party is involved, and the fault is yours, you become liable to pay for the damages made to the other party. Thus, when you have fallen short of vehicle insurance coverage, you are left with two options. If you have enough personal savings you are good to go. Or else you must try to negotiate with the other party.\\nHowever, if the fault is not yours, you must gather relevant documents, and witnesses and file an FIR to back your claim.\\nWhat Can You Do To Avoid Falling Short of Vehicle Insurance Coverage Post Accident?\\nRunning out of bike insurance coverage is the worst nightmare of every two-wheeler owner, especially when faced with an accident. You must ensure the following points to avoid getting into such situations:\\nCheck Your Insurance Status\\nThere is no substitute for regular insurance check. It is a must for every vehicle owner to stay updated with the current status of their bike insurance policy to ensure they have enough coverage to cover all potential accidents in the future.\\nIf you find anything otherwise, you can always connect with your insurance provider and ask for additional coverage inclusion in your existing plan. It also enables you to detect the lapse date of your insurance plan so that you can renew the plan on time and continue receiving coverage.\\nStay Aware of Your Requirements\\nThe key to avoiding being underinsured is to thoroughly analyse your requirements. Considering accidents are some of the most unexpected scenarios, you must opt for the necessary coverage to be able to deal with such situations without any financial burden on your shoulders.\\nSo make sure to assess your needs and potential damages to choose the best insurance coverage for your bike.\\nOpt for Additional Coverage\\nEven though you are required to pay higher costs for including riders or add-ons, these are always beneficial in the long run. With additional coverage included in your bike insurance plan, you will never have to worry about falling short of bike insurance. Hence, it is desirable to determine the type of benefits you wish to receive and opt for the same at the time of issuance.\\nThe Bottom Line\\nTo sum it up, being underinsured can lead you to face critical situations when it comes to ensuring the security of your vehicle during accidents. Thus, as two-wheeler owners you must understand that accidents can be unexpected and hence you need to have enough insurance coverage to deal with such unforeseen circumstances. So make sure to follow the points mentioned in the blog and make informed decisions without panicking during unexpected bike damage.\\n  insurance policyBusiness Growthretail India\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nWhy IDV Calculation Matters: A Complete Guide to Using an IDV Calculator for Your Bike Insurance\\nBY - Guest author\\nNov 15, 2024 / 7 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  When insuring your bike, multiple factors must be considered to ensure you get the best coverage for your requirements. One crucial element is the Insured Declared Value (IDV), which plays a significant role in determining your premium and maximum claim amount. In this guide, we will explore why IDV calculation matters and how you can use an IDV calculator for your bike insurance.\\nWhat is the Insured Declared Value?\\nThe Insured Declared Value or IDV represents the current market value of your bike. It determines the maximum amount you can claim in the event of a total loss or theft of your bike. For instance, if your bike is stolen or has irreparable damage during an accident, the insurance company will reimburse the amount based on the IDV set on your policy.\\nIn addition, the IDV considers multiple factors, such as the bike’s age, depreciation, and the manufacturer’s listed selling price. The IDV is usually closer to the selling price for new bikes, but as your bike ages, the IDV decreases due to depreciation.\\nWhy Does Insured Declared Value Matter in Bike Insurance?\\nUnderstanding the importance of IDV will help you to appreciate the significance of setting the value. Here are a few reasons why IDV calculation matters for bike insurance:\\n1.    Determines Claim Amount\\nIDV sets the upper limit for claim reimbursements. It indicates that the IDV is the maximum amount you can claim during a theft or total damage. Setting a lower IDV might save you some premium costs but reduces the claim amount, potentially leaving you with insufficient coverage.\\n2.    Impacts Premium Costs\\n\\nIDV directly influences your bike insurance premium. A higher IDV means higher premiums as the insurer's liability increases. On the other hand, a lower IDV results in lower premiums but lower claim payouts. Hence, you can use a two wheeler insurance premium calculator to balance premium affordability and adequate coverage.\\n3.    Affects Depreciation\\nDepreciation is one of the biggest factors that affects your bike's IDV. In addition, every year, your bike's value decreases as it ages. The depreciation rate is pre-defined by the insurance regulators and varies depending on your bike's age. Hence, you must consider the depreciation value when calculating IDV value to get a realistic assessment.\\nHow to Use an Insured Declared Value Calculator?\\nHere is a step-by-step guide you can follow to use an IDV calculator for your bike insurance:\\nStep 1: Visit the Insurance Company’s Website\\nOpen the website of your preferred insurance company and visit its IDV calculator webpage to use the calculator.\\nStep 2: Input Your Bike's Details\\nThe calculator will prompt you to input details such as make, model, variant, year of manufacture and registration date. Some calculators may ask for more details, like engine capacity and fuel type.\\nStep 3: Add Accessories\\nYou must input the details of extra fittings or modifications in your bike. The calculator will calculate their approximated value in the final IDV calculation.\\nStep 4: Choose Depreciation\\nThe calculator will automatically calculate the correct depreciation rate based on your bike’s age. \\nStep 5: Check the IDV\\nThe calculator will calculate the IDV, which becomes the current market value of your bike. You can use that IDV to compare different insurance companies or options.\\nStep 6: Adjust for Your Budget\\nIf the calculated IDV is higher or lower than your budget can permit, you may modify the IDV values to understand how it will affect your premium. \\nWhat is the Role of an Insured Declared Value Calculator?\\nAn IDV calculator is a valuable tool for bike owners. It simplifies the process of IDV calculation, offering quick and accurate results without the need for manual calculations. Here is how using an IDV calculator can benefit you:\\n1. Convenient and Accurate\\nAn IDV calculator saves you time by providing instant, accurate results for your bike insurance. Enter your bike’s details, and the calculator handles the rest, reducing errors. With updated depreciation rates and market values built-in, IDV calculators help you avoid under or over-insurance, ensuring your coverage is precise and reliable.\\n2. Compare and Customise Policies\\nIDV calculators let you compare premiums across different IDV values, helping you find the perfect balance between premium cost and coverage. It also allows customisation by including added accessories.  You can get a premium quote tailored to your bike’s actual value. \\nFinal Words\\nInsured Declared Value is vital for your bike insurance policy to determine the premium and maximum claim amount. Setting an accurate IDV ensures you are adequately protected without overpaying premiums. You can use an IDV calculator to streamline the calculation process and make informed decisions quickly and easily. Moreover, you secure optimal coverage for your bike, giving you peace of mind on every ride.\\n  Business Intelligence in Retailretail India\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nQuick Commerce Takes Center Stage: 70 pc of Indian Shoppers Rely on Speed & Convenience for Grocery Needs\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nNov 07, 2024 / 13 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In a fast-paced world where time is increasingly a precious commodity, quick commerce is transforming how shoppers fulfill their grocery needs. From its humble beginnings as a convenience-driven service for busy urbanites, quick commerce has surged into mainstream grocery shopping.\\nAccording to a recent report by NielsenIQ (NIQ), 31 percent of Indian shoppers now turn to quick commerce as their main grocery channel, with an additional 39 percent relying on it for top-up purchases. This dramatic shift toward quick commerce reflects a broader consumer movement toward speed, accessibility, and convenience, underscoring critical changes in how shoppers interact with the retail ecosystem.\\nThe Quick Commerce Revolution: Key Drivers\\nQuick commerce, characterized by its ultra-fast delivery times and focus on small-basket, high-frequency purchases, is reshaping the FMCG sector. As NIQ’s Mitesh Dabrai noted, the doubling in quick commerce usage over the past year is a clear indicator of its relevance to modern shoppers, who are increasingly “discerning, price-conscious, and channel-agnostic.” Economic pressures, coupled with a desire for instant gratification, have driven a significant portion of Indian shoppers toward quick commerce for essentials.\\nRising Food Prices and Demand for Convenience\\nRising inflation has forced Indian shoppers to make difficult choices regarding where and how they shop. With 87 percent of consumers feeling the impact of escalating food prices, price-conscious behavior has become more pronounced across various segments. However, while price sensitivity has affected purchasing decisions, it has not diminished the demand for convenience. Rather, shoppers are now more strategic in balancing their needs for affordability with a growing inclination for faster, more efficient shopping experiences.\\nQuick commerce meets this dual need by offering solutions that appeal to both convenience-seekers and budget-conscious shoppers. For instance, with smaller basket sizes and frequent top-up options, shoppers can buy what they need without overextending their budgets. Categories such as Ready-to-Eat meals and Salty Snacks have shown substantial growth in the quick commerce channel, with 42 percent and 45 percent of shoppers using it to meet their cravings for convenience food.\\nChanging Shopper Behavior: The Shift to Multichannel\\nThe NIQ report highlights a notable shift in consumer habits, with shoppers embracing multichannel shopping options. Interestingly, 20 percent of offline shoppers now also rely on online platforms for grocery needs, with metropolitan shoppers using quick commerce for their primary grocery purchases, and non-metro shoppers using it for top-ups. This shift underscores a more versatile shopper who moves seamlessly between channels based on needs, availability, and time constraints.\\nE-commerce and quick commerce are no longer confined to secondary, fill-in purchases. Increasingly, consumers are using these platforms for monthly shopping, particularly in metropolitan regions, where delivery infrastructure supports rapid, reliable service. According to the report, staples have emerged as a prominent category within e-commerce platforms, with 60 percent of Indian shoppers using online channels for essential groceries.\\nThe Influence of Price and Promotions on Store and Brand Choice\\nAs consumers shift to quick commerce, they are also becoming savvier about promotions and discounts, which significantly influence where and how they shop. Modern Trade is a powerful draw for promotions, with 40 percent of shoppers saying they change stores based on offers, while impulse buying is led by both Modern Trade (47 percent) and Online channels (35 percent).\\nPrice sensitivity has increased across all income groups due to inflation, pushing shoppers to seek better value propositions. For FMCG brands, this trend is an opportunity to differentiate themselves through strategic pricing, bundle offers, and exclusive promotions. By providing value-added services within the quick commerce space—such as cashback offers, discount codes, or subscription models—brands can capture loyal consumers who value both savings and efficiency.\\nQuick Commerce as a Driver of Private Label Growth\\nPrivate labels have emerged as a growth opportunity within the quick commerce ecosystem, fueled by rising consumer interest in premium and affordable alternatives. The NIQ report found that 67 percent of shoppers are actively seeking premium private labels, particularly in categories like carbonated beverages, staples, and snacks. The popularity of private labels reflects an evolving consumer landscape, where shoppers are increasingly open to exploring non-traditional brands that offer value without compromising quality.\\nQuick commerce platforms, with their agile supply chains and focus on convenience, are uniquely positioned to promote private label products. These platforms often feature exclusive deals on their in-house brands, further strengthening customer loyalty and increasing the likelihood of repeat purchases. For FMCG companies, investing in private label development and aligning these brands with consumer preferences can be a powerful differentiator.\\nThe Role of Quick Commerce in Sustainability and Local Preferences\\nIn an era of heightened awareness about sustainability, quick commerce also caters to a growing demand for eco-friendly and locally produced goods. As more consumers seek to align their shopping habits with their values, quick commerce has the potential to respond by promoting local and sustainable products. The NIQ report reveals that sustainability is particularly significant to Gen Z and Boomer shoppers, who increasingly prefer locally manufactured items.\\nBy providing access to locally sourced groceries and sustainable products through quick commerce, retailers can capitalize on this trend while supporting local businesses. Additionally, with shorter delivery times and optimized logistics, quick commerce minimizes the carbon footprint of last-mile delivery—a critical consideration for environmentally conscious shoppers.\\nThe Future of Grocery Shopping: Challenges and Opportunities for FMCG Brands\\nFor FMCG brands, the rise of quick commerce presents both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, quick commerce enables brands to connect with consumers at a time when convenience is king. However, it also demands constant innovation and adaptability to meet evolving shopper expectations. Shoppers today expect not only speed but also a seamless, frictionless shopping experience, regardless of the platform or channel.\\nOne critical area for FMCG brands is product assortment. In a space that relies heavily on fast-moving, high-demand items, curating the right mix of products is essential. For example, categories like Ready-to-Eat meals, snacks, and staples are well-suited for quick commerce, while less essential items may not perform as strongly. Brands must identify and prioritize items that align with quick commerce shopper behavior, ensuring they remain relevant and responsive to changing needs.\\nAddressing the Evolving Demand for Speed and Efficiency\\nThe growing preference for quick commerce among Indian shoppers signals an opportunity for brands to rethink logistics and distribution models. By investing in technology that optimizes inventory management and improves delivery efficiency, FMCG brands can better serve this high-demand channel. Moreover, as retailers become more data-driven, they can leverage consumer insights to tailor offerings based on region, purchasing history, and seasonal demand.\\nThe Significance of Consumer Loyalty in a Competitive Landscape\\nAs more brands enter the quick commerce space, retaining consumer loyalty will become paramount. While price and promotions are significant, brands must also focus on fostering relationships with consumers through loyalty programs, personalized offers, and responsive customer service. Building brand affinity in the quick commerce segment requires ongoing engagement and innovation, ensuring that shoppers feel valued and connected to the brand.\\nQuick Commerce as the New Normal\\nQuick commerce has undeniably reshaped the grocery shopping landscape, bringing unprecedented convenience to consumers while challenging traditional retail models. As FMCG brands navigate this evolving market, they must be agile and responsive to consumer demands for speed, value, and accessibility. By embracing quick commerce as a vital growth driver and aligning strategies with emerging shopper preferences, brands can capture a new era of grocery shopping that is fast, flexible, and firmly rooted in the priorities of today’s consumers.\\nIn summary, there is a clear shift toward convenience-focused, multichannel shopping behaviors, with quick commerce at the forefront. FMCG brands must capitalize on this transformation by investing in technology, fostering loyalty, and delivering high-quality, relevant products. As quick commerce solidifies its role within the retail ecosystem, it will continue to redefine what it means to shop for groceries in a digital, on-demand world.\\n  Quick CommerceGrocery ShoppingFood & Grocery\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nThe Game-Changing Potential of Generative AI in Transforming Supply Chains\\nBY - Guest author\\nOct 26, 2024 / 8 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Generative AI stands out as a transformative force in supply chain management for delivering flexibility and resilience. Half of supply chain leaders plan to implement generative AI (gen AI) in the next 12 months, with an additional 14 percent already in the implementation stage, according to a survey by Gartner, Inc.\\nThe Evolution of AI in Supply Chains\\nArtificial Intelligence has evolved over the years from basic automation to sophisticated algorithms capable of complex decision-making. Generative AI represents the latest leap in this evolution. Unlike traditional AI models, generative AI can learn and adapt with minimal human intervention, provided it has access to accurate data sets. The Asia Pacific region expected the greatest amount of change from utilizing AI and ML technologies in supply lines from 2023 until 2025. The continent was more than three percent ahead of the next region, showing more dedication and capacity for AI usage in supply chain. A major leap for supply chains long dependent on outdated systems and manual processes.\\nTransformative Applications of Generative AI\\nEnhancing Supply Chain Planning\\nTraditional methods of supply chain planning and demand forecasting often involve labor-intensive processes and are prone to inaccuracies. Generative AI changes the game by leveraging historical data and real-time market trends to make precise predictions about future demand. This enables companies to optimize their resource allocation, minimize waste, and be ready to meet customer needs. A good example is of Mars, a global food production leader that harnessed generative AI for enhancing logistics efficiency. This collaboration significantly lessened the need for manual interventions by 80 percent, cut down shipping expenses, reduced emissions, and enhanced punctual deliveries. Amazon, a leading online retailer, also leverages AI to effectively manage inventory, ensuring products are readily available when required. This strategy enhances customer satisfaction and boosts operational efficiency.\\nStreamlining Supplier Selection and Management\\nSelecting the right suppliers is crucial for maintaining a robust supply chain. Generative AI can analyze vast amounts of supplier data, including performance metrics, compliance records, and market conditions, to identify the best partners. This simplifies the supplier selection process and ensures that businesses are working with reliable partners. Walmart has been piloting an AI-based tool called \\\"Pactum\\\" for autonomous negotiations with suppliers. This tool is part of their efforts to streamline supplier selection and management using generative AI.\\nAdditionally, generative AI can automate many administrative tasks, such as contract management and compliance checks, reducing the burden on supply chain managers.\\nOptimizing Production and Operations\\nGenerative AI can significantly enhance production efficiency by optimizing manufacturing processes. From predictive maintenance to quality control, AI models can identify potential issues before they become critical, thereby reducing downtime and improving overall productivity. Companies such as Kinaxis and Dematic are building data-driven supply chains to address logistics use cases including scenario modeling, planning, operations management, and automation. This is valuable in industries where even minor disruptions can have significant financial implications.\\nRevolutionizing Logistics and Delivery\\nGenerative AI can significantly impact logistics. By analyzing real-time data on traffic, weather, and other variables, AI models can optimize delivery routes to reduce transit times and costs. A good example is, Blue Dart, a premier logistics company, which leverages generative AI to streamline its logistics operations. \\nChallenges and Considerations in Implementing Generative AI\\nWhile the benefits of generative AI are compelling, its implementation is not without challenges. Initial phases may see some degree of \\\"hallucination\\\" or errors in AI predictions, necessitating human oversight. It is crucial to have trained personnel who can validate and refine AI outputs to ensure accuracy.\\nAnother critical consideration is data security. Generative AI relies on vast amounts of data, and any compromise can lead to significant risks. Ensuring robust data protection measures and compliance with security standards is essential for successful AI integration.\\nLastly, the readiness of the workforce to adopt and leverage AI technologies plays a pivotal role. Training programs and change management initiatives are vital to equip employees with the skills and knowledge needed to work alongside AI effectively. To solve these challenges, we need to study those organizations who have benefited the most from generative AI and adopt best practices in context to individual challenges of every company and industry.\\nThus, integrating generative AI into supply chains is essential for sustainable growth and excellence, positioning businesses at the forefront of innovation.\\n  Authored By\\nAnand Iyer, Vice President & Global Delivery Head, Microsoft Business Applications & Modern Workplace, Infosys\\n  Supply ChainArtificial intelligenceRetail Supply Chain\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nIndia’s Festive Season Kicks Off with 20% Rise in E-Commerce Volumes\\nBY - Aritra Ghosh\\nFeatures Writer, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nOct 03, 2024 / 11 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The 2024 festive season sales have kicked off with a bang in the Indian e-commerce industry, delivering a significant increase in both order volumes and gross merchandise value (GMV).

This is indicative of a growing trend where personal care and beauty items are becoming more central to festive season shopping in India. Kapil Makhija, Managing Director and CEO of Unicommerce, attributes this surge to increasing consumer interest in self-grooming and beauty products during the festive period.\\nHe noted, “Festive season sale has become an exciting phase of the year when everyone awaits the attractive offers and the extensive variety of products. While this continues as a trend year after year, we see an increasing number of brands participating in the sale season, affirming India's status as a digitally forward country.”\\nThe health and pharma category was another star performer, registering a 33 percent rise in order volumes.

Nearly 6.5 crore customers shopped on Meesho during Day 1, with fashion, personal care, home & kitchen, and electronic accessories being the most popular categories. On average, 506 kurtis, 376 sarees, and 360 kids' wear items were sold every minute, reflecting a staggering demand for affordable fashion.\\nMeesho Mall, the company’s curated shopping experience, also saw ~2.5X growth in orders compared to last year.

These regions, often underserved by traditional retail, are experiencing a digital transformation, thanks to the expansion of internet access and e-commerce platforms.\\nAccording to industry experts, the growing demand from these smaller cities is driven by a combination of rising incomes and increasing familiarity with digital shopping platforms. As consumers in these regions become more comfortable with online shopping, e-commerce giants are focusing on providing a wide range of products tailored to their needs. From affordable fashion to everyday household items, platforms like Flipkart and Meesho are catering to the growing aspirations of Tier II and III city consumers.\\nWhat’s in Store for the Rest of the Festive Season?\\nWith the festive season far from over, there are plenty more opportunities for growth.

This trend reflects the growing demand for faster, more efficient delivery services across key cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and beyond.\\nZepto's iPhone 16 Launch\\nZepto has added the iPhone 16 to its platform, making it available for 10-minute delivery in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai.

It is no longer just a perk—it is a must-have—something customers expect. With e-commerce booming, global sales are predicted to hit $7.4 trillion by 2025, according to eMarketer. Fashion retailers are feeling the pressure, and keeping up with fast delivery is quickly becoming one of their biggest challenges.\\nTake India, for example. The fashion e-commerce market there was worth $14 billion in 2023, and it is set to grow to nearly $19 billion by 2030. It is growing at a rate of 34 percent every year, fueled by more people getting online, more smartphone use, and higher disposable incomes. But with this growth, shoppers expect more than just great products—they want them delivered fast. Many retailers, especially those with storefronts, are struggling to meet this expectation. That is where new-age marketplaces are stepping in and shaking things up, making it easier for brands to offer ultra-fast delivery without having to build out their own logistics systems.\\nThese platforms are not just meeting the demand for speed—they are changing how we think about the entire shopping experience. Nowadays, people want their fashion items delivered almost instantly. A global survey by Localz found that 77 percent of shoppers expect their order within two hours or less. In India, it is even more intense—80 percent of shoppers are looking for same-day delivery, and more than half of them expect to get their order in just a few hours (Invespcro, 2023). This shift in expectations is pushing brands to find ways to offer faster service, and partnering with these fast-delivery marketplaces is the easiest way to do it.\\nThe exciting part? The market for these platforms is still pretty fresh, so brands that get in now have a huge opportunity for a first-mover advantage. According to Market Data Forecast, the same-day delivery market in India alone is expected to reach over $10 billion by 2028. That is a massive chance for brands to solve the fast delivery challenge early on and stand out in a rapidly growing market.\\nPartnering with these new-age platforms is a game changer. Instead of worrying about how to offer ultra-fast delivery on their own, brands and storefronts can team up with these platforms, who already have the logistics and technology in place. It’s a win-win—brands get to offer quick delivery, and customers get the convenience they crave without the usual hassles. After all, 53 percent of shoppers have admitted to canceling a purchase just because the delivery was too slow (MarketingProfs, 2023). That is a lot of potential sales lost, all because delivery didn’t meet expectations.\\nWhat makes these marketplaces stand out is how they combine fast delivery with a smooth shopping experience. It is not just about getting the product quickly—they offer things like real-time tracking, easy returns, and even personalized recommendations. It turns what could be a frustrating waiting game into an experience that keeps customers engaged and happy. Imagine ordering your favorite outfit and having it at your door in under an hour—there is no doubt it is changing the way people shop.\\nFor fashion brands and retailers, the key here is that they do not have to tackle this delivery issue on their own. By teaming up with these platforms, they can offer fast service to their customers, without all the costs and headaches of building their own shipping systems. That is especially important now that consumers expect things like free shipping (with 66 percent of them considering it standard, according to Inc, 2023) and ultra-fast service.\\nThis is a big chance for brands to upgrade their game and provide something customers genuinely want. With the fashion e-commerce market growing like crazy and consumer expectations rising just as fast, getting in on these fast-delivery platforms could be the key to staying ahead of the competition. It’s not just about speed—it’s about making the entire shopping experience easier and more enjoyable.\\nThe future of fashion retail is clearly moving toward faster, more convenient shopping. As the market keeps expanding, brands that partner with platforms designed to offer ultra-fast delivery are setting themselves up to succeed. They will be meeting customer demands, offering a smoother shopping experience, and gaining a huge competitive advantage in a market that is only going to get bigger.\\nIn short, the message is simple: fast delivery is here to stay, and it is changing how people shop. Brands that move into this space by partnering with these new-age marketplaces are not just keeping up—they are getting ahead.\\n  Authored By\\nSaurabh Gumber, Founder and CEO, VAMAZA MALL\\n  DeliveryFashion eCommerceeCommerce Delivery\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nOne-Third of Grocery Products on E-Commerce Platform Have Labeling Issues\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nSep 17, 2024 / 9 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  India’s food industry has witnessed a remarkable transformation in recent years, with the packaged food market growing at an unprecedented rate. According to EuroMonitor, India is now the third-largest packaged food market in the world. In tandem with this growth, the e-commerce grocery segment has also surged, with monthly revenue surpassing Rs 6,800 crore in July 2024, marking a 12.1 percent rise from June 2024, as per ECDB. This remarkable growth is driven by the increased demand for convenience and accessibility, with more consumers turning to online platforms for their grocery needs.\\nHowever, a recent study conducted by Natfirst has uncovered significant compliance issues within this fast-growing sector. The analysis, which examined 2,871 grocery products listed on a major Indian e-commerce platform, found that 34.83 percent of products (approximately 1,000) had incomplete or inaccurate labelling information, posing challenges for consumers in making well-informed food choices.\\nThe study revealed several critical discrepancies in the labelling of pre-packaged food products. These issues ranged from inconsistent or missing net weights to illegible barcodes and poor-quality product images. Notably, 65 products lacked multiple essential labelling elements, including the nutritional table, ingredients list, and net weight. Furthermore, 232 products featured images that were unclear or illegible, while 139 products did not provide a nutritional table at all.\\nSuch lapses in labelling are a cause for concern, particularly in a country like India, where food safety and consumer rights are of paramount importance. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has long mandated strict labelling and display regulations for pre-packaged foods under the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations. These regulations are designed to provide consumers with accurate and clear information, allowing them to make informed decisions about the food they consume. However, there is still a significant gap in compliance.\\nThe Importance of Accurate Food Labelling\\nFood labelling is not just about adhering to regulatory norms—it plays a critical role in ensuring consumer safety and trust. Accurate and comprehensive labelling provides essential information on nutritional values, ingredients, allergens, and other critical details that help consumers make informed dietary choices. Inaccurate or incomplete labels can lead to confusion, potentially putting consumers at risk, especially those with specific dietary requirements or allergies.\\nMoreover, with the growing popularity of health-conscious eating, many consumers rely on nutritional labels to guide their food choices. A lack of clarity or missing information could hinder their ability to make healthier choices, undermining efforts to promote public health.\\nFSSAI Reactivates Draft Amendment Regulations\\nIn response to the findings of the Natfirst study and the increasing pressure to ensure compliance, the FSSAI has recently reactivated the draft Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Amendment Regulations, 2022. These amendments aim to strengthen the labelling norms for pre-packaged food products sold through e-commerce platforms.\\nUnder these revised regulations, e-commerce companies will be required to provide a clear image of the principal display panel of pre-packed foods on their platforms. This panel should prominently feature essential details, such as the product’s net weight, ingredients, and nutritional information. Additionally, all food products listed on e-commerce sites must display the manufacturer’s FSSAI License or Registration number, ensuring that consumers can verify the product's compliance with food safety standards.\\nThe regulations also permit the sampling of food products at any point in the supply chain to ensure adherence to labelling norms. This provision will help maintain the integrity of food products throughout their journey from manufacturer to consumer, reinforcing consumer confidence in the safety and quality of the food they purchase online.\\nThe Need for Retail Intelligence Solutions\\nThe findings of the Natfirst study underscore the urgent need for retail intelligence solutions to ensure real-time compliance with FSSAI norms. As Ravi Putrevu, Founder of Natfirst and TruthIn, emphasized, “Maintaining high-quality food labelling standards is an ongoing challenge, especially with millions of products being sold each month across diverse sales platforms. Regulatory compliance must be ensured not only in the domestic market but also in international markets where Indian food products are exported.”\\nRetail intelligence solutions can help bridge the gap between regulatory requirements and actual compliance by automating the process of monitoring and verifying product labelling. These solutions can provide real-time insights into product listings, flagging any discrepancies or missing information and helping e-commerce platforms and manufacturers correct these issues promptly.\\nAdditionally, these tools can assist in maintaining consistent product quality and transparency, which are vital for ensuring consumer trust in both domestic and international markets. With the global demand for Indian packaged food products on the rise, particularly in markets such as the US, UK, and Middle East, ensuring adherence to international food safety standards is crucial.\\nREAD MORE: What’s Fueling the Grocery Industry in 2024\\nThe Role of E-Commerce Platforms\\nE-commerce platforms play a pivotal role in facilitating consumer access to a wide range of food products. However, they also bear a significant responsibility in ensuring that the products listed on their platforms comply with regulatory norms.

In 2023, global e-commerce sales in the jewelry market reached approximately $250 billion, a figure expected to grow by 8 percent annually. The convenience and accessibility of online shopping have made it possible for consumers to purchase exquisite pieces from the comfort of their homes. For brands today, navigating this online retail landscape presents both opportunities and challenges. This article explores how e-commerce is reshaping the jewelry market and offers insights into successfully managing an online jewelry business.\\nThe Rise of Online Jewelry Shopping\\nChanging Consumer Behavior\\nIn recent years, consumer behavior has shifted significantly towards online shopping, with 85 percent of shoppers in the U.S. alone purchasing products online in 2023. The pandemic further accelerated this trend, driving a 25 percent increase in online jewelry sales globally. Jewelry, once thought to be an item that needed to be seen and felt in person, has found its place in the e-commerce world. Consumers now value the convenience, variety, and often competitive pricing available online, with 62 percent of millennials preferring to shop for jewelry online rather than in physical stores.\\nTrust and Authenticity\\nOne of the major challenges in selling jewelry online is establishing trust and authenticity. According to a survey, 70 percent of online jewelry shoppers cite trust as their primary concern. To address this, brands have adopted strategies such as providing detailed product descriptions, high-resolution images, and certificates of authenticity. Additionally, jewelry brands with a strong legacy, such as those with over 20 years in the market, are leveraging their experience to build credibility, resulting in a 15 percent higher customer retention rate compared to newer brands.\\nBuilding a Strong Online Presence\\nUser-Friendly Website\\nA user-friendly website is crucial for any e-commerce business. Statistics show that 88 percent of online consumers are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience. For a jewelry brand, the website should feature an intuitive design, easy navigation, and a seamless checkout process. High-quality images and videos, along with comprehensive product details, help customers make informed decisions. Brands that invest in high-quality visuals experience a 25 percent increase in conversion rates compared to those with basic imagery.\\nEngaging Content\\nEngaging content is vital to attract and retain customers. Data reveals that content marketing can generate three times more leads than traditional outbound marketing, at 62 percent less cost. Jewelry brands are increasingly focusing on creating blog posts, social media updates, and email newsletters to showcase new collections, share styling tips, and highlight the brand’s story. This personalized approach to content has been shown to increase customer engagement by 18 percent.\\nCustomer Reviews and Testimonials\\nCustomer reviews and testimonials play a significant role in building trust, with 92 percent of consumers reading online reviews before making a purchase. Encouraging satisfied customers to share their experiences and prominently displaying these reviews on the website can significantly boost conversion rates. In fact, products with over 50 reviews are 4.6 times more likely to be purchased than those without reviews.\\nLeveraging Technology\\nVirtual Try-Ons\\nInnovative technologies like virtual try-ons are enhancing the online jewelry shopping experience. A study found that 78 percent of shoppers prefer to use virtual try-on tools before making a purchase, and brands offering this feature have seen a 15 percent increase in sales. This technology bridges the gap between online shopping and the in-store experience, allowing customers to visualize how a piece will look on them, which reduces the likelihood of returns by 35 percent.\\nAugmented Reality (AR)\\nAugmented reality (AR) is another technology that is revolutionizing the online jewelry market. By 2026, the AR market is expected to be worth over $97.76 billion, with the jewelry sector being a significant contributor. AR apps allow customers to view jewelry pieces in 3D and from different angles using their smartphones. This interactive experience has been shown to increase customer engagement by 20 percent and boost purchase intentions by 33 percent.\\nProviding Exceptional Customer Service\\nPersonalized Consultations\\nEven in the digital age, personalized customer service remains crucial. Offering virtual consultations through video calls allows customers to receive expert advice from the comfort of their homes. Studies indicate that 56 percent of online shoppers are more likely to return to a site that offers personalized services. By providing 1:1 consultations, brands can better understand clients’ preferences and recommend pieces that suit their individual styles, leading to a 10 percent increase in customer satisfaction.\\nHassle-Free Returns\\nA flexible and hassle-free return policy is essential to build trust and ensure customer satisfaction. According to a report, 67 percent of shoppers check the return policy before making a purchase, and 92 percent will buy again if the return process is easy. Jewelry brands with customer-friendly return policies experience up to 20 percent higher repeat purchase rates. Ensuring that customers feel confident they can return or exchange items if they are not completely satisfied is key to fostering long-term loyalty.\\nIn conclusion, e-commerce has opened up new avenues for the jewelry industry, enabling brands to reach a broader audience and offer a convenient shopping experience. By building a strong online presence, leveraging technology, and providing exceptional customer service, jewelry brands can successfully navigate the online retail landscape. The key lies in balancing tradition with innovation, ensuring that every online interaction reflects the same care and quality as an in-store experience. With the right strategies in place, the future of online jewelry retail looks bright and promising.\\n  Authored By\\n  Rituu B Jhaveri, Founder, Rowa’s Jewels\\n  e-commenceJewelryonline retail\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nMerging Content and Commerce in the Age of Discovery\\nBY - Aritra Ghosh\\nFeatures Writer, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nSep 02, 2024 / 10 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The digital age has ushered in a new era of retail—one driven by discovery rather than necessity. This shift towards \\\"discovery commerce\\\" is redefining consumer behavior and transforming the Indian retail landscape. Rather than traditional, search-based shopping, consumers are being captivated by products through entertainment and social engagement. Platforms like Roposo are at the forefront of this revolution, integrating discovery commerce into their business model. Mansi Jain, Senior Vice President & GM of Roposo, shared insights into this exciting trend and its broader implications for the retail industry in an exclusive conversation with IndianRetailer.\\nThe Evolution of Discovery Commerce\\nAt its core, discovery commerce involves spontaneous purchasing, often inspired by visual or social content. It is about creating an emotional connection, pulling consumers into the buying journey when they least expect it. Unlike traditional e-commerce, where consumers seek specific products, discovery commerce prompts unplanned purchases based on inspiration.\\n\\\"Discovery commerce is about sparking joy and curiosity,\\\" says Mansi Jain. \\\"It’s the digital version of window shopping, but much more immersive. Consumers are not just seeing a product—they're experiencing it. Whether through influencer-driven content or dynamic fashion hauls, platforms like ours create moments of delight that lead to unexpected purchases.\\\"\\nThis experiential form of commerce is rapidly growing. According to a BCG-TikTok study, shoppertainment—commerce blended with entertainment—is projected to become a $1 trillion industry in Asia-Pacific alone. For Indian retailers, this shift represents a vast opportunity to engage consumers in a new, highly interactive way.\\nThe Power of Content and Community\\nPlatforms like Roposo seamlessly blend product discovery with entertainment and social interactions. From makeup tutorials to fashion reviews, the platform integrates commerce into engaging content, ensuring that the viewer's journey from discovery to purchase is smooth and intuitive.\\n\\\"Our goal is to make the shopping experience feel like a natural extension of the content,\\\" explains Jain. \\\"We show consumers what’s trending, but in a way that resonates emotionally. A skit, a product review, a behind-the-scenes look—all these forms of content foster a sense of community. It's more than shopping; it’s belonging to a trend.\\\"\\nRoposo’s ability to create communities around these trends sets it apart from traditional e-commerce. When consumers see their favorite influencers wearing a specific brand or style, they are more likely to trust and purchase those products. By building this kind of connection, the platform fosters brand loyalty and customer engagement on a deeper level.\\nThe Role of AI in Personalization\\nPersonalization plays a crucial role in discovery commerce, and advanced technologies like AI are driving this shift. Platforms like Roposo use AI to track consumer preferences, ensuring that the content and products they see align with their interests.\\n\\\"We are constantly analyzing purchasing patterns and browsing behavior to refine the user experience,\\\" says Jain. \\\"AI helps us understand what a user might like based on their past interactions. It's about making the content—and the shopping experience—personalized and frictionless.\\\"\\nBy offering recommendations tailored to individual preferences, platforms are creating a more engaging and convenient shopping environment, which ultimately drives higher conversions. For retailers, this means investing in AI-powered solutions is no longer optional—it’s essential.\\nShoppertainment\\nIndia's diverse consumer base makes it a fertile ground for discovery commerce, particularly among Gen Z and millennials. As these younger consumers embrace social platforms for entertainment, they’re also embracing new ways to shop. Roposo’s shoppertainment model—where content and commerce merge—allows brands to tap into this demographic.\\n\\\"Gen Z, in particular, values experiences over products,\\\" notes Jain. \\\"They want to be entertained and inspired, and then, if they see something they like, they’ll buy it. That’s the magic of shoppertainment—it turns passive viewers into active shoppers.\\\"\\nThis phenomenon is reshaping the way retailers and brands think about customer engagement. Retailers can no longer rely solely on product descriptions and reviews. Instead, they must create interactive, story-driven experiences that appeal to emotion as much as practicality.\\nThe Impact on Traditional Retail\\nDiscovery commerce is not just a digital trend; it's influencing offline retail as well. As consumers become accustomed to engaging, personalized content, they expect the same from physical stores. Retailers are now tasked with creating immersive, in-store experiences that mirror the online journey.\\n\\\"Consumers want seamless transitions between online and offline,\\\" says Jain. \\\"When they see something online that inspires them, they expect to find it in stores too. This convergence of digital and physical retail is the future.\\\"\\nRetailers embracing this shift are blending discovery with convenience, incorporating elements of shoppertainment into their physical spaces. Interactive displays, in-store influencers, and experiential marketing are becoming key strategies in capturing consumer interest.\\nA Growing Ecosystem of Partnerships\\nOne of the keys to success in the discovery commerce landscape is building strong partnerships. Roposo has strategically collaborated with brands like Campus Sutra and Uptownie to enhance its offerings and connect with established audiences.\\n\\\"Partnerships are crucial in the fast-moving world of shoppertainment,\\\" says Jain. \\\"They allow us to bring fresh, engaging content to our users while giving brands access to a highly engaged audience. It’s a win-win.\\\"\\nThese partnerships also allow brands to capitalize on the platform’s reach, integrating their products into a seamless content-to-commerce journey. For Roposo, this approach has proven successful in expanding its user base and driving revenue growth.\\nThe Road Ahead\\nLooking to the future, Mansi Jain is optimistic about the potential for discovery commerce in India. As AI and content creation technologies evolve, platforms like Roposo are poised to take full advantage of the growing demand for personalized, shoppable content.\\n\\\"Discovery commerce will only become more prevalent,\\\" she asserts. \\\"We’re working on tools that empower creators to produce high-quality, shoppable content with ease. This will democratize content creation and allow brands to engage with consumers in more meaningful ways.\\\"\\nIn a market as dynamic as India, where social interaction and commerce are deeply intertwined, discovery commerce offers a powerful way forward. For retailers, it’s about creating experiences, not just transactions—building relationships rather than simply selling products.\\nAs the lines between entertainment, community, and commerce continue to blur, discovery commerce is set to reshape the future of retail in India and beyond.\\n  e-eCommerceretail India\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nEnhancing On-Shelf Availability: A Festive Season Blueprint for E-commerce Businesses\\nBY - Guest author\\nAug 31, 2024 / 11 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  As consumers across the world embrace e-commerce businesses, OSA has become extremely critical in the current and future online markets. With the latest numbers from Future Market Insights, the global on-shelf availability solution market is set to hit the desired figure of $4.8 billion by 2024. Analyses show that this market will even continue to grow to a whopping $11.6 billion by 2034, such that there is a healthy CAGR of 9.1 percent in the market during the research period of the forecast. These figures explain the growing need to manage OSA as e-commerce firms seek to deliver what consumers want, especially during holidays such as this festive season.\\nOn the one hand, the festive season is a unique chance to boost sales and make customers happy for e-commerce organizations. But with the growing demands comes the question of availability—having the right product at the right time and place. OSA is important during this period because a stockout situation will mean no sales, unsatisfied consumers, and loss of brand loyalty. For e-commerce businesses gearing up for the festive season, here is the ultimate guide to improving on-shelf availability.\\n1. Demand Forecasting and Inventory Planning\\nAccurate demand forecasting is the foundation of high OSA during the festive season. E-commerce businesses must analyze historical sales data, market trends, and competitor behavior, while also considering potential events, holidays, and promotions that could drive demand. Leveraging analytics and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance these forecasts, ensuring that inventory levels are aligned with expected demand. Inventory planning should be conducted in tandem with demand forecasting, taking into account supply chain disruptions, supplier capabilities, and lead times. While it's advisable to stock up on frequently sold products, businesses should avoid overstocking to minimize holding costs and prevent markdowns post-season.\\n2. Strengthening Supplier Relationships\\nThe festive season is one of the important periods requiring suppliers to meet their commitments at high levels. It is necessary for e-commerce businesses to clearly convey the demand that they expect in the future to their suppliers so that the required capacities are available to meet such demands. Loyal supplier relationships mean that a company will be accorded special treatment, including priority on the stocks to be restocked and the time that it takes to have them restocked. Also, risks of supply chain disruption may be addressed by the expansion of the suppliers’ list. This means that if one supplier is unable to supply essentials, having other sources available can help minimize the chances of running out of stock.\\n3. Leveraging Technology for Real-Time Inventory Management\\nOrganizations need to employ real-time inventory management systems in order to maintain OSA during the festivities. These systems facilitate the monitoring of stock in different sales outlets and stores, giving a clear view of inventory. These systems can then be linked to e-commerce to automatically update stock status so that the customers do not get the wrong impression of what is available in the warehouse. Furthermore, real-time inventory means that inventory management decisions have to be made in a short span of time. In cases where a particular product is selling much faster than expected, call for automatic re-ordering or transfer of stock in anticipation of the popular item.\\n 4. Optimizing fulfillment and logistics\\nThe idea of smooth functioning of fulfillment and logistics is key to sustaining OSA during the festive period. Fulfillment centers should be evaluated and possibly altered to make certain that the products are picked, packed, and shipped as quickly as possible. This might have entailed efficiencies in the processes of the warehouse, hiring of more workers, or outsourcing the extra load to a third-party company. Another important element that must be taken into consideration is last-mile delivery. Cutting costs and improving delivery reliability can be accomplished through choosing credible courier services and providing numerous delivery choices for customers, and they can also help minimize stockouts. One might also suggest adopting the distribution center strategy, which means warehousing is closer to certain key markets to reduce lead time and increase OSA.\\n5. Dynamic Pricing and Promotions Management\\nFor OSA, particularly during the festive season, price and promotional strategies can play a great deal. It is recommended that e-commerce businesses should implement dynamic pricing models as a way of controlling the demand, especially where the retail price can be changed based on the existing sales data and available stock. For instance, if a given product is going around very fast in the market, some price increases can be made in order to regulate demand and scarcity. Promotions also must be accurately determined and controlled. Although using discounts and special offers promotes the products, it also contributes to exhaustion. Promotion decisions should be made with consideration to stock status, firms should offer either substitute options or pack slow-movers together with the best sellers in order to ensure equal sales of all stock.\\n 6. Enhancing Customer Communication\\nIt demonstrated that customers should be informed clearly and in advance when OSA is in operation during the festive season. If a product is unavailable or lost, it is important to advise the clients to prevent cases of disappointment. That is why revealing similar goods’ availability, giving options to pre-order, or offering back-in-stock notifications also contribute to maintaining customers who might switch to other suppliers.\\nMoreover, businesses should employ customers’ information to get in touch with the customers in subsequent purchases and remind them of potential products they have bought in the past or related to. This does not only improve the experience of shoppers but also creates demand for the available products in the market.\\n7. Post-Season Analysis and Continuous Improvement\\nAfter the festive season, conducting a thorough performance analysis based on OSA key indicators is crucial. Businesses should evaluate areas of success and identify opportunities for improvement. Key metrics to assess include the number of stockouts, replenishment times, and the accuracy of demand forecasts. Insights gained from this analysis should be used to refine processes, strengthen supplier relationships, and enhance inventory management for future high-demand periods.\\nMaintaining availability during the holiday season is a difficult but essential process for many e-commerce companies. Through demand forecasting, building supplier relations, being able to manage inventory in real-time, choosing the best options for fulfilling orders, using dynamic pricing options, being able to communicate effectively with customers, and analyzing data after the season, businesses can increase their sales while also providing a good shopping experience for the consumer. These strategies assist not only in getting through the holiday season but also in excelling during the period.\\n  Authored By\\nPunit Sindhwani, Founder & CEO, PAXCOM \\n  e-commerceE-commerce industryBusiness in retail\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nWhen Old Meets New: Marrying GenAI with Conventional CX Strategies for E-commerce Success\\nBY - Guest author\\nAug 25, 2024 / 9 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  With more people in India shopping online than ever before, customer experience has become a priority for many e-commerce businesses. Orders worth $46.67 billion were placed in India last fiscal year, putting these businesses under significant pressure to not just deliver seamless and convenient customer experiences, but to do so at scale.\\nCX has become more than a differentiator—it is a necessity for business success. And when businesses pay attention to delivering great CX, the reward is high–99 percent of India customers are willing to spend more on brands that offer personalized and streamlined services.\\nAI will play a pivotal role in every customer interaction, particularly as an overwhelming majority of CX leaders in India anticipate a five-fold increase in customer service interactions in the next three years, according to the Zendesk Future of AI-powered CX report. And many brands are turning to technologies such as generative AI to help streamline and enhance experiences for customers and agents. In fact, 92 percent of CX leaders in India believe AI is changing everything about CX and have plans to meet it head on quickly.\\nThat said, adopting this new technology doesn't mean abandoning conventional channels like phone calls or emails. Customers will want to reach out on whichever channel they prefer at any given moment, so the best strategy is to offer AI-augmented multi-channel support. Here’s how.\\nEliminate Repetition, Reduce Grind\\nAI is changing the way customers interact with brands for the better. It has taken the clunky chatbot with frustrating, circular decision trees and transformed them into AI agents with the most advanced conversational capabilities that understand customers’ contact reasons, intents, and sentiments. Well-trained AI never forgets a customer or their history with a brand, and customer context and data are readily on hand, providing around-the-clock support with reliable and correct answers regardless of which channel they choose to communicate.\\nUsing the reasoning abilities of the latest AI models, AI agents can learn, understand and be coached just like a human agent and make decisions for straightforward cases. Such a high level of understanding saves time and effort for both the customer and agent, while delivering personalized experiences that make customers feel cared for. Coupled with smart automation, generative AI helps simplify tasks, leaving human agents free to concentrate on important conversations that require critical thinking, solving complex problems and meeting business goals.\\nImmersive Experiences at Scale\\nAI is helping many e-commerce companies shift towards more enriched, immersive CX. In fact, 96 percent of CX leaders believe every interaction is a dynamic blend of commerce, service and support, enhancing customer engagement. Many of these technologies exist today and e-commerce companies looking to enhance their CX can already start incorporating them.\\nFrom hypergrowth to festive season rushes and daily fluctuations, generative AI is capable of offering immersive and personalized experiences at scale by equipping agents with real-time recommendations at every step of the customer journey to offer deeper personalization. It can analyze a customer’s shopping history and make strong recommendations based on their preferences.\\nIn addition to its conversational capabilities, generative AI can give AI agents a persona that reflects the brand’s personality across all conversations between chatbots and customers, reinforcing their brand and fully immersing in the experience. For e-commerce businesses trying to stand out from the competition, extending brand personality to their chatbots can be highly advantageous. It creates consistency across support channels and locations, helping customers form more meaningful, immersive connections with the brand.\\nUnlocking Growth Opportunities\\nGenerative AI holds the potential to unlock massive growth through conversational commerce. It puts intelligence at agents' fingertips, making it easier to identify new revenue opportunities through upselling and cross-selling. When more than one in three customers globally make a purchase after receiving a WhatsApp or text message, it’s a sign for e-commerce companies to adopt generative AI-powered CX tools that help them boost revenue.\\nHowever, e-commerce businesses don’t have to revamp their entire online presence to integrate generative AI tools that offer better shopping experiences, but rather integrate it into existing assets like apps or websites, to drive more revenue opportunities. Generative AI can analyze purchase history and style preferences to offer personalized recommendations to customers in real-time, identifying new avenues of upselling and cross-selling without overwhelming the customer.\\nDigital-savvy customers in India want to choose how and when they shop, so it should come as no surprise that they also want to choose how and when they contact customer support. Their lifestyles, routines, devices, and personal preferences play a major role in how and when they connect with a brand, making omnichannel the best strategy.\\nProviding round-the-clock omnichannel service offers convenience and gives customers more control over their experience, reducing customer effort and increasing satisfaction. The question isn’t about abandoning conventional strategies to make way for generative AI but about seamlessly integrating generative AI into existing systems and processes for the best results.\\nAs AI evolves, companies must continually assess and adapt their CX operations to meet the ever-changing needs of consumers. By embracing the potential of AI, CX professionals can improve operational efficiency, deliver quality CX that is consistent and accurate and, ultimately, improve business outcomes.\\n  Author:\\nVasudeva Rao Munnaluri, RVP India & SAARC, Zendesk\\n  Artificial intelligencee commerceconsumer engagement strategies\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nHow Technology is Improving Last-Mile Delivery during Holiday Season\\nBY - Guest author\\nAug 24, 2024 / 10 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  India's festive seasons, marked by celebrations like Dussehra, Diwali, Christmas, and New Year, see a dramatic increase in consumer activity. This surge in demand, coupled with a high festive sales pitch that sets the tempo for temporary hiring, is expected to drive a 15-20 percent year-on-year increase in demand, fuelled by consumer spending, resurgence in the rural economy amid prospects of a good harvest and a buoyant market. As a result, same-day and next-day deliveries are set to boom this festive season, presenting unique challenges for last-mile delivery—a critical component of e-commerce logistics. With the expansion of online shopping, technology is playing a pivotal role in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of last-mile delivery operations, especially during these peak periods.\\nApplication Programming Interface (API) integration has revolutionized how logistics companies manage their operations. APIs enable seamless data exchange between different systems, facilitating automated processes from pre-pickup to post-delivery. This continuous flow of information ensures that all stages of the supply chain are synchronized, allowing for real-time updates and efficient management of deliveries. During high-demand periods, such as festivals, API integration helps maintain smooth operations and reduces the risk of errors or delays.\\nIn India, where traffic congestion and infrastructure limitations are common, advanced route optimization software is crucial. This technology analyzes real-time traffic data, geographic constraints, and other variables to determine the most efficient delivery routes. By optimizing routes, logistics companies can ensure timely deliveries, reduce fuel consumption, and lower operational costs. During festive seasons, when traffic congestion is often at its peak, route optimization becomes even more critical in meeting delivery deadlines.\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used for demand forecasting, a vital aspect of managing last-mile delivery during the festive season. AI-driven analytics analyze historical data, market trends, and current shopping patterns to predict order volumes accurately. This predictive capability allows logistics companies to adjust their resources, inventory, and delivery schedules accordingly. For example, during Diwali or Dussehra, accurate demand forecasting enables companies to prepare for the spike in orders, ensuring that they can handle the increased volume without compromising on service quality.\\nReal-time tracking technology has transformed the consumer experience by providing up-to-date information on the status of orders. Customers can now track their packages from dispatch to delivery, receiving automated notifications and live updates. This level of transparency not only enhances customer satisfaction but also reduces the number of inquiries related to order status. During the busy festive season, real-time tracking helps manage customer expectations and improves overall service quality.\\nThe festive season often requires a temporary increase in the workforce to handle the higher volume of orders. Technology solutions that streamline the recruitment and scheduling of temporary delivery personnel are essential for managing this increased demand. Automated systems can efficiently handle the recruitment process, schedule shifts, and ensure that the additional workforce is utilized effectively. This helps maintain delivery standards and ensures that orders are fulfilled in a timely manner.\\nThird-Party Logistics (3PL) providers play a crucial role during peak periods by offering additional resources and specialized expertise. These providers can scale their operations to meet the increased demand, manage complex logistics, and ensure that last-mile delivery is handled efficiently. By partnering with 3PL providers, companies can leverage their experience and infrastructure to navigate the challenges of festive season logistics more effectively.\\nGenerative AI is emerging as a powerful tool in the logistics sector. By analyzing large datasets, generative AI provides advanced capabilities for demand forecasting, route planning, and risk management. This technology helps in predicting potential disruptions and generating actionable insights to improve operational efficiency. During the festive season, generative AI can be particularly useful in managing the complexities of high demand and ensuring that logistics operations run smoothly.\\nSustainability is becoming a major focus in the logistics sector. Innovations such as electric vehicles, sustainable packaging solutions, and energy-efficient warehouses are being adopted to reduce the environmental impact of logistics operations. Route optimization also supports sustainability goals by lowering fuel consumption. As Indian consumers become more environmentally conscious, adopting eco-friendly practices not only helps in reducing carbon emissions but also enhances brand loyalty and reputation.\\nAdditionally, the use of pop-up warehouses increases during the festive season. These temporary facilities are set up closer to high-density urban areas and consumer hubs, putting the frontline workforce at the forefront of technology. Logistics companies leverage their core capability to attract, onboard, train, and monitor flexi staff at these frontlines and within the pop-up sites. By strategically positioning these warehouses, they can reduce last-mile emissions, delivery times, and operational costs. Pop-up warehouses also help manage the increased volume of orders during festive seasons, ensuring that products reach customers more quickly and efficiently. This approach not only improves delivery speed but also supports environmental sustainability by minimizing the carbon footprint associated with long-distance transportation.\\nAs technology continues to evolve, it will play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of last-mile delivery in India. Innovations such as autonomous delivery vehicles, drone deliveries, and blockchain for supply chain transparency are on the horizon. Embracing these advancements will further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of last-mile delivery operations, helping logistics companies to meet customer expectations and navigate the challenges of peak seasons.\\n  Authored By\\n  Vikram Manuskhani, Chief of Operations, Blue Dart\\n  Artificial intelligenceDigital technologySustainability\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nIndian Brands Lead APJ Region in Generative AI Adoption\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nAug 23, 2024 / 9 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, Indian brands are emerging as trailblazers in the adoption of generative AI, setting a benchmark for the entire Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) region. According to the newly released Adobe Digital Trends 2024 APJ report, Indian companies are not only leading the region in generative AI deployment but are also demonstrating unparalleled data capabilities and a strong commitment to governance frameworks. These strengths position them as pioneers in technological innovation, poised to shape the future of AI on a global scale.\\nA Dynamic Shift in Digital Strategy\\nThe report underscores a significant shift across the APJ region, with brands gearing up for major organizational changes to scale up generative AI adoption. However, it is the Indian market that stands out for its aggressive embrace of this technology. The findings reveal that 45 percent of Indian organizations already have generative AI solutions in place and are actively assessing their effectiveness, while an additional 27 percent are conducting pilots.\\nAs Anindita Veluri, Director of Marketing, Adobe India noted, \\\"Indian brands are confidently deploying generative AI while enhancing their productivity on a larger scale. This innovation offers a distinct path to integrate data, anticipate customer needs, and provide more targeted and timely content delivery.\\\" Veluri highlighted that brands leading in this space are not just experimenting but are strategically integrating AI to drive consumer loyalty, efficient conversion, and trust.\\nGenerative AI: Transforming Customer Engagement\\nOne of the standout insights from the report is the extent to which Indian brands are leveraging data and algorithms to personalize customer interactions. According to the findings, 52 percent of Indian brands are using data to deliver personalized website experiences, the highest percentage in the APJ region. Moreover, 38 percent of these brands employ generative AI to craft customized emails, messages, and other content, further demonstrating their leadership in this domain.\\nThis approach is not merely about adopting new technology but about transforming how brands engage with customers. By integrating generative AI into existing workflows, Indian companies are able to deliver more relevant and timely content, significantly enhancing the customer experience.\\nChallenges in Scaling AI Adoption\\nWhile the enthusiasm for generative AI is palpable among Indian executives, the report also highlights a critical gap between leadership and day-to-day users. Across the APJ region, only 4 percent of executives report that their organization lacks a formal generative AI adoption strategy. However, this figure rises significantly among practitioners, indicating a disconnect between strategic intent and operational execution.\\nIn India, this gap is particularly evident, with many users expressing skepticism about the effectiveness of current AI rollouts. This divergence in perception underscores the need for clearer communication and more inclusive strategy development as companies move from pilot phases to full-scale implementation.\\nGovernance and Ethical Use: A Priority for Indian Brands\\nA significant area of focus for Indian brands, as highlighted in the report, is the development of governance frameworks and ethical guidelines for AI use. 70 percent of senior executives in India feel well-prepared to implement these guidelines, and 58 percent are actively investing in governance frameworks—a figure that is 14 percentage points above the APJ average.\\nThis proactive stance is crucial as generative AI continues to evolve, bringing with it complex ethical considerations. Brands that invest in robust governance structures not only protect themselves from potential risks but also build trust with consumers, which is increasingly becoming a key differentiator in the digital marketplace.\\nOrganizational Transformation in the AI Era\\nTo fully leverage the benefits of generative AI, Indian brands are also anticipating significant changes to their operating models and organizational structures. By the end of 2024, 80 percent of Indian brands expect to use generative AI extensively for idea creation and conception, allowing skilled employees to refine these concepts into final products. Additionally, 76 percent of Indian brands plan to utilize AI to auto-update live content—a practice that is expected to be more prevalent in India than anywhere else in the world.\\nThese initiatives reflect a broader trend within the region, where brands are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of AI. Over two-thirds of APJ brands believe that generative AI will have the most significant impact on data analytics and management, more so than any other part of the organization.\\nIn India, this is particularly pronounced, with 75 percent of brands planning to increase their investment in customer data management in 2024. This focus on data underscores the critical role it plays as a cornerstone capability in the AI era.\\nUpskilling and Ethical AI Usage\\nAs brands navigate the complexities of AI adoption, there is also a strong emphasis on upskilling employees and establishing clear guidelines for AI usage. The report identifies advanced AI skills training for key staff (47 percent) and the development of policies for ethical and secure generative AI usage (45 percent) as top priorities for Indian brands.\\nThese efforts are essential to ensure that employees are not only equipped to work with new technologies but also understand the ethical implications of their use. By fostering a culture of responsible AI usage, Indian brands can continue to lead in this space while mitigating potential risks.\\nIndia's Role in Shaping the Future of AI\\nThe Adobe Digital Trends 2024 APJ report paints a compelling picture of how Indian brands are at the forefront of generative AI adoption. Their exceptional data capabilities, commitment to governance, and willingness to embrace organizational change set them apart as pioneers in the digital landscape.\\nAs Veluri aptly concluded, \\\"Those at the forefront are leading with higher consumer loyalty, efficient conversion, and trust.\\\" Indian brands are not just adopting AI—they are shaping their future, setting the standards for innovation, ethical use, and customer-centricity in the digital age.\\n  Artificial intelligenceIndian Brands\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nThe Future of E-Commerce: Integrating AI and Virtual Reality for an Immersive Retail Experience\\nBY - Guest author\\nAug 24, 2024 / 9 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Online shopping is quickly evolving with the help of new technology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) are making shopping more interactive and personalized. According to Mordor Intelligence, the AI in Retail market is estimated to be worth $9.85 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $40.49 billion by 2029. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.68 percent from 2024 to 2029. Also, the market size for Virtual Reality in Retail was valued at  $3.18 billion in 2023 (Market Research Future). Additionally, a study by Deloitte and Snap found that 67 percent of people globally use AR at home, and 41 percent of them use it for shopping. As these technologies become more common, they will greatly change the way we shop online.\\nMaking Shopping Easier with AI and VR\\nAI and VR are changing how customers interact with online stores. One of the most notable examples is Sephora’s Virtual Artist. This tool uses AI to let customers virtually try on makeup products, from lipstick to eyeshadow. By simply uploading a photo, users can see how different shades will look on their faces, helping them choose the right product without the guesswork. This not only enhances the shopping experience but also reduces the chance of returns, making it a win-win for both customers and retailers.\\nIKEA enhances customer experiences with spatial AI through its virtual reality (VR) capabilities. The IKEA app enables customers to use VR to visualize how furniture will look in their homes before making a purchase. By immersing themselves in a virtual environment, users can place 3D models of furniture in their own spaces, helping them make more informed decisions. This level of convenience is becoming increasingly important as online shopping continues to grow.\\nReducing Cart Abandonment with AR and VR\\nCart abandonment is a significant challenge in e-commerce, with nearly 78.65% of shoppers leaving items in their carts without completing the purchase, according to Barilliance. Integrating AI and VR into e-commerce platforms can help address this issue by reducing the uncertainty that often leads to cart abandonment.\\nFor example, AI-powered recommendations can tailor product suggestions based on customer behavior, while VR enables customers to virtually try on products or visualize them in their homes. These technologies enhance the shopping experience, making it easier for customers to make informed decisions and complete their purchases. As a result, retailers benefit from improved customer satisfaction and increased conversion rates, making AI and VR invaluable tools for reducing cart abandonment.\\nConnecting with Customers in More Interactive Ways\\nAI and VR are transforming how retailers engage with customers, offering new levels of interactivity. These technologies enable the creation of virtual showrooms where customers can explore products in an immersive environment. This enhanced engagement can significantly impact purchasing decisions.\\nFor instance, Sephora’s Virtual Artist leverages AI and VR to allow users to try on makeup virtually and access tutorials on achieving various looks. This interactive approach not only provides a unique and valuable experience but also fosters brand loyalty by engaging customers in a meaningful way.\\nSaving Time and Money for Shoppers\\nAI and VR are making online shopping more convenient than ever. These technologies save customers time by allowing them to try products virtually instead of visiting physical stores. This is particularly useful for items like furniture and makeup, where seeing the product in context can make a big difference.\\nMoreover, AR and VR can lead to cost savings for consumers. By providing a realistic preview of products, these technologies help customers avoid buying items that do not meet their expectations. This “try before you buy” approach ensures that customers are more satisfied with their purchases, leading to fewer returns and a better overall shopping experience.\\nCreating Immersive Retail Environments\\nOne of the most exciting advancements in e-commerce is the use of VR to create immersive retail environments. By leveraging VR, retailers can design virtual versions of their physical stores, allowing customers to explore products in a simulated space. This not only replicates the in-store experience but also introduces features that are impossible in the physical world.\\nFor example, virtual stores can be dynamically updated to reflect seasonal trends or customer preferences, thanks to AI-driven insights. This keeps the shopping experience fresh and engaging, encouraging customers to return and explore new offerings.\\nWhat’s Next for E-Commerce?\\nThe integration of AI and VR in e-commerce is still in its early stages, but the potential is enormous. As these technologies become more widespread, they will likely redefine the online shopping experience. By enabling customers to explore products in a more interactive and personalized way, AI and VR will play a key role in the future of e-commerce.\\nAs the AI and VR markets continue to expand, with the global AI market projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3 percent from 2023 to 2030, reaching $1,811.8 billion by 2030 (GrandViewResearch), and the global VR market expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.9 percent, reaching approximately $187.28 billion by 2032 (Precedence Research), e-commerce will increasingly rely on these technologies to enhance customer experiences and drive sales. Retailers who adopt AI and VR early will be well-positioned to lead in this new era of online shopping.\\n  Authored By\\nPiyush Gupta, CEO, VOSMOS\\n  e-commerceArtificial intelligenceVirtual Reality\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nOnline Businesses are fuelling India’s Pre-Owned smartphone industry\\nBY - Guest author\\nAug 18, 2024 / 8 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  India is home to 659 million smartphone users, the second largest smartphone user base in the world. Internet penetration, mobile-first infotainment and financial platforms, and superlative camera features are some of the contributing factors to the growth of smartphone aspirations, even in Tier II and below towns. However, aspiration needs affordability to create a market. This is where pre-owned smartphones come into play.\\nIndustry estimates project that the overall pre-owned smartphone market in India is close to $5 billion and is expected to reach $10 billion by 2030. The organised segment accounts for 20-25 percent of the current market. This segment is largely made up of online platforms that enable consumers to buy authentic pre-owned smartphones, along with various value-added benefits. These platforms, including several new entrants, are not only reshaping consumer behaviour but also propelling technological advancements and sustainability initiatives. Let us see how online businesses, particularly newer players, are playing a pivotal role in the pre-owned smartphone industry in India.\\nConsumer Behaviour: Convenience and Affordability\\nNew online platforms have made it incredibly convenient for consumers to buy and sell pre-owned smartphones. The typical hassles of offline transactions, like trust deficit and the long time required to identify buyers or sellers, have already been tackled to a great extent. These new brands provide user-friendly interfaces, detailed product listings, and secure payment gateways that add to the user’s convenience.\\nApart from convenience, consumers also look for affordability when it comes to changing or upgrading their smartphones. With the tech advancements, more consumers are willing to try out the newly launched high-end phones. New platforms allow them to sell their old devices so that they can partially fund their new purchases. Consumers can also fund the gap between their sales and purchase prices through easy EMIs. Thus, consumers can access a range of smartphones at significantly lower prices than new models, making technology accessible.\\n Ensuring Quality and Trust\\nThe quality and authenticity of Pre-Owned smartphones has always been a big concern for consumers. To address this, many online platforms now offer certified pre-owned phones that have been thoroughly inspected on many parameters and have gone through multiple quality checks. This assures the consumers that their phones are in good working condition. The additional guarantee provided by the platform takes this confidence a notch further.\\nSustainability Initiatives: Promoting a Circular Economy\\nThe Pre-Owned smartphone market contributes significantly to the cause of environmental sustainability. By extending the life cycle of smartphones, online platforms focus on the reduction of manufacturing and electronic waste, which is a growing concern globally.\\nAlthough India's 'Make in India' initiative aims to boost local manufacturing, the reality includes a complex landscape. While many components are sourced locally, high-end parts often need to be imported due to supply chain constraints. Unfortunately, these imports face steep tariffs aimed at protecting domestic manufacturers, thereby increasing overall production costs.\\nHowever, India faces challenges in becoming a dominant manufacturing hub. Key issues include deficiencies in infrastructure, such as inadequate transportation networks and limited access to advanced technology and connectivity. These deficiencies can significantly hinder manufacturing productivity and operational efficiency.\\nDespite these challenges, India possesses substantial potential as a manufacturing destination. Addressing infrastructure gaps and improving 'ease of doing business' metrics are critical steps to unlock this potential fully. Additionally, proactive steps to integrate more seamlessly into the global tech manufacturing supply chain will be essential for India to capitalise on its strengths and attract further investment.\\\"\\nChallenges and the Road Ahead\\nDespite the significant progress made by multiple online platforms, there are still some challenges. As mentioned earlier in the article, a large chunk of the Pre-Owned phone market is still unorganised. Here, the consumers are always prone to issues such as poor quality and the lack of standardization. Moreover, in some consumer segments, there is still an underlying perception about used smartphones being inferior in quality.\\nThey need to continue investing in technology and customer education to come around these issues. Enhancing transparency through detailed product information, and warranties, and providing credible after-sales service will help consumers feel more confident about their purchases. Additionally, these platforms can also collaborate with manufacturers and authorized service providers to standardize the refurbishment process. This will provide a consistent supply of high-quality pre-owned smartphones.\\nWhile the challenges are steep, the current trend indicates that online platforms will be able to address most of these. This will also help them play an even more important role in Digital India.\\n  Authored By \\nYug Bhatia, CEO and Founder, ControlZ.  \\n  smart phonesonline businessindian retail\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nQ-Commerce Set to Surge with $6 Billion GMV in FY25\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nAug 14, 2024 / 11 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In the ever-evolving landscape of Indian retail, Quick Commerce (Q-commerce) has swiftly transitioned from a novel concept to a pivotal component of urban living. Delivering everything from groceries to gadgets at remarkable speeds, Q-commerce has tapped into the pulse of new-age consumers, highlighting India’s adaptability and appetite for innovation. As Indian cities continue to grow, so does the demand for convenience, driving the rapid rise of Q-commerce as a crucial part of daily life.\\nQ-commerce has not only transformed how we shop but has also significantly disrupted traditional retail models. The growth numbers from last year are nothing short of remarkable. According to RedSeer, the Q-commerce market grew at a rate of 70-75 percent in FY24, a figure that eclipsed the growth of traditional e-commerce by nearly fivefold. However, the question remains: how long can Q-commerce sustain this meteoric rise?\\nThe Rise of Q-Commerce\\nIndia's urban population, especially Generation Z and millennials, is leading the charge in the adoption of Q-commerce. These consumers value convenience and speed, preferring to have products delivered to their doorstep rather than spending time at physical stores. The demand for on-demand shopping solutions saw Q-commerce platforms like Swiggy Instamart, Dunzo, and Zepto thrive, even as similar models floundered in other global markets.\\nKey drivers of growth include:\\nIncreasing User Base: The Average Monthly Transacting Users (MTU) grew by over 40 percent in FY24. This surge in users was largely driven by the younger, tech-savvy generation in metro cities who have embraced the convenience of ordering essentials and non-essentials alike at the click of a button.\\nHabit Formation: The ordering frequency per user jumped from 4.4 times a month in FY21 to nearly 6 in FY24, indicating that consumers are now using Q-commerce platforms not just for infrequent top-ups but for regular stock-ups. This shift in consumer behavior is a result of growing trust in these platforms and their ability to deliver consistently.\\nHigher Spending Per User: The average order value (AOV) on Q-commerce platforms increased by more than 15 percent in FY24, thanks to the rise in event-driven purchases and the diversification of categories. Consumers now use Q-commerce platforms for everything from daily essentials to specialized goods such as beauty products, home decor, and gifting items.\\nMetro Domination: In FY24, nearly 90 percent of the Q-commerce market was concentrated in metro cities. These densely populated urban centers are ripe for Q-commerce, where consumers prioritize time-saving and convenience.\\nWhat to Expect in FY25 and Beyond\\nThe growth trajectory of Q-commerce shows no signs of slowing down. According to Redseer’s projections, the Q-commerce market is expected to grow by 75-85 percent in FY25, potentially reaching a GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) of around $6 billion. This will be fueled by an additional 5 million new MTUs, further expanding the user base.\\nExisting users, too, are expected to spend more, with projections suggesting a 20 percent increase in expenditure on Q-commerce platforms. This uptick will be driven by increased trust and habit formation, along with experimentation in newer propositions such as sustainable products, health-oriented offerings, and non-essential categories. These developments will likely attract consumers to explore more diverse options, including luxury items and general merchandise beyond groceries.\\nAs demand grows, so too will the infrastructure. Q-commerce platforms are expected to add at least 500 new dark stores (warehouses for quick delivery) across India, with a focus on the top 30-50 cities. These dark stores will optimize delivery logistics and improve the throughput of existing operations, ensuring that platforms maintain their competitive advantage.\\nWhen Will the Boom Stabilize?\\nWhile the growth of Q-commerce appears unstoppable, experts predict that the market will stabilize in the coming years. By FY26, India’s Q-commerce user base is expected to reach around 20 million MTUs, at which point the growth rate may begin to plateau. This mirrors trends seen in the food delivery sector, where growth slows after reaching a certain user saturation point.\\nThe majority of new users in the next few years will come from the top 30-50 cities, while expansion into smaller towns and rural areas will remain limited to experimentation. The current dark-store model may not be viable in less dense markets due to logistical challenges and lower demand. However, platforms may explore alternative models, such as partnering with local Kirana stores for fulfillment in smaller cities. While there is skepticism about the scalability of this approach, Q-commerce could surprise the market as it did last year.\\nInnovations in Q-Commerce\\nThe versatility of Q-commerce platforms has already been demonstrated, from delivering daily essentials to luxury items. As platforms continue to evolve, several potential innovations could shape the future of Q-commerce in India:\\nVirtual Storefronts: Imagine walking into your favorite brand's local store—not physically, but virtually through a Q-commerce platform. The integration of virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) could allow consumers to shop in a virtual environment, providing a seamless and immersive shopping experience.\\nEarly Morning Essentials: Q-commerce could expand into the space of early-morning subscriptions, offering essentials like milk, eggs, and bread. Currently dominated by subscription-based services, this sector could be a lucrative target for Q-commerce players.\\nQ-commerce First Brands: The rise of Q-commerce could lead to the emergence of brands that are developed specifically for these platforms. These \\\"Q-commerce first\\\" brands would be designed to meet the unique demands of quick delivery, including fast-moving, high-demand products that cater to the urban consumer.\\nSustainability and Niche Products: As consumer awareness around sustainability grows, Q-commerce platforms might explore offering eco-friendly products, such as zero-waste packaging or organic goods. Catering to this rising demand could open up new growth avenues and distinguish platforms in a competitive market.\\nREAD MORE: The Meteoric Rise of Q-Commerce in India, Estimated to be 3X by 2029\\nThe Future of Retail Is Now\\nAs India stands on the brink of a retail revolution, Q-commerce is not just a passing trend but a fundamental shift in how consumers interact with brands. The rise of Q-commerce has redefined expectations around convenience, speed, and accessibility, ensuring that the future of retail is just a few clicks away.\\nThe growth of Q-commerce has been nothing short of a retail phenomenon, and while the road ahead may bring new challenges, it is clear that Q-commerce will remain a dominant force in the Indian retail market for years to come. With its rapid expansion, innovative potential, and ability to adapt to changing consumer needs, the future of shopping is here—and it’s faster than ever before.\\n  Quick CommerceIndian retail industry\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nThe Future of Digital Grocery: Five Strategic Recommendations for Profitability & Growth\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nAug 12, 2024 / 10 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In an era where digital transformation is reshaping every industry, the grocery sector is no exception. To stay competitive and profitable, grocers must navigate the complexities of digital commerce with a customer-centric approach. However, many grocers struggle to deliver a profitable digital offering due to legacy systems and siloed operations. \\nAccording to Capgemini’s latest report, these five strategic recommendations guide the development of a successful, sustainable, and scalable digital grocery capability, emphasizing the importance of data integration, advanced technologies like AI and generative AI (GenAI), and a strong focus on customer needs.\\n1. Develop a Customer-Centric Strategy\\nThe cornerstone of a successful digital grocery solution is a deep understanding of the customer. Grocers must acknowledge that they cannot cater to everyone; instead, they should focus on identifying and prioritizing key customer segments. Developing a customer-centric strategy involves creating a clear vision of who the primary customers are, what they need, and what motivates their purchasing decisions. These insights will inform the design of the digital offering, from product selection to fulfillment options.\\nFor instance, some customers may prioritize convenience and speed, while others may value product variety or price. By understanding these preferences, grocers can tailor their digital services to meet the specific needs of their target audience. This might involve offering a range of fulfillment options, such as quick delivery for time-sensitive orders or next-day delivery for those who plan their shopping in advance. Additionally, grocers should consider enabling personalized recommendations and offers, which can increase customer loyalty and drive repeat business.\\n2. Refine Existing Systems to Enhance the Experience and Optimize Operations\\nMany grocers are currently operating with legacy systems that were not designed for the demands of digital fulfillment. These systems, often hastily adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic, are typically difficult to optimize and rarely enable profitable operations. To unlock the revenue potential of digital grocery, grocers must be willing to overhaul their existing infrastructure and embrace new ways of working.\\nThis transformation requires strategic investments in modern systems and digital solutions powered by AI and GenAI. Such technologies can enhance both sides of the customer promise—availability and fulfillment—by automating processes, improving accuracy, and enabling more agile operations. For example, AI-driven demand forecasting can help grocers maintain optimal inventory levels, reducing stockouts and overstock situations. GenAI can also be leveraged to create more personalized shopping experiences, generating tailored recommendations and offers based on real-time customer data.\\nHowever, grocers must be cautious of falling into the trap of investing in point solutions that only address specific issues without considering the broader business strategy. To avoid deepening silos within the organization, investments should be aligned with the overall digital strategy and aimed at creating a seamless, integrated experience for customers.\\n3. Prioritize Investments That Maximize Profitability\\nDigital grocery is a challenging space with razor-thin margins, making it crucial for grocers to carefully evaluate their investments. To ensure long-term growth and sustainability, grocers should prioritize developing capabilities that have a clear and significant impact on profitability.\\nOne area of investment that can deliver substantial returns is improving the accuracy of availability data. Inaccurate data can disrupt order fulfillment, leading to costly substitutions, increased food waste, and poor replenishment decisions—all of which negatively impact profitability. By contrast, accurate availability data can streamline operations, reduce waste, and enhance customer satisfaction.\\nWhile personalization is another valuable capability, its impact is often limited by the grocer’s data maturity. Without the ability to scale personalized initiatives, the return on investment may be marginal. Therefore, grocers should focus on building data maturity and ensuring that their data infrastructure supports high-precision availability and fulfillment before expanding into more advanced personalization efforts.\\n4. Develop a Flexible Fulfillment Infrastructure and Network\\nThe fulfillment stage is critical to the success of any digital grocery offering. Customers today expect a seamless experience that balances speed, convenience, and affordability. However, the importance of these factors varies from one customer to another, making it essential for grocers to develop a flexible fulfillment infrastructure that can cater to diverse needs.\\nGrocers have several options for fulfilling digital orders, including internal delivery services, third-party partnerships, high-tech solutions like drones or robots, and click-and-collect services. Each option comes with its own set of advantages and challenges, and the right choice will depend on the specific needs of the target customer base.\\nLast-mile delivery is particularly important, as it directly influences customer satisfaction and their likelihood of returning. While optimizing costs is essential, grocers must remember that last-mile delivery is not just an expense—it’s a critical touchpoint in the customer journey. A well-executed last-mile strategy can enhance the overall shopping experience, building customer loyalty and driving repeat purchases.\\n5. Build Data Maturity to Achieve High-Precision Availability and Fulfillment\\nData maturity is a key enabler of a successful digital grocery strategy. Many grocers currently rely on historical data or generic customer profiles, which limits their ability to provide a responsive and personalized experience. To achieve high-precision availability and fulfillment, grocers must integrate and synchronize disparate data sources, enabling a more accurate understanding of customer behavior and inventory levels.\\nAdvanced analytics, AI, and GenAI can play a crucial role in this process. By leveraging these technologies, grocers can gain real-time insights into customer preferences, optimize inventory management, and enhance the overall efficiency of their operations. For example, AI can be used to predict demand patterns, allowing grocers to adjust their inventory and fulfillment strategies accordingly. GenAI can also help in creating dynamic pricing models that respond to changes in demand, maximizing profitability.\\nMoreover, a mature data infrastructure can support the personalization of the customer experience. By analyzing customer data, grocers can curate personalized offers and recommendations, increasing customer satisfaction and driving sales. In turn, these insights can help grocers make more informed decisions about product assortment, pricing, and promotions, further enhancing profitability.\\n  Grocerye-grocery\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nDecoding the eCommerce Matrix: Unveiling the 'Whys' Behind Success and Challenges\\nBY - Guest author\\nAug 10, 2024 / 10 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The rapid growth of eCommerce in recent years has created a situation where competition is fierce. In this highly competitive market, understanding the eCommerce matrix is crucial for brands who want to succeed. Making decisions based on intuition alone can lead to suboptimal outcomes, which can be costly in an industry as unforgiving as eCommerce.\\nAs more businesses enter the online space, standing out becomes harder, making it imperative for brands to decode their performance metrics to identify what drives success and what hinders growth.\\nSuccess Factors in eCommerce\\nData analytics is at the heart of successful eCommerce strategies. It allows brands to make informed decisions, outperform competitors, and adapt to market changes swiftly. By using data, brands can get insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends, allowing them to build their marketing efforts effectively.\\nFor example, personalization in marketing, driven by data, significantly enhances customer loyalty and boosts sales. 80 percent of consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences.\\nWhen data informs decisions, every aspect of the business, from marketing strategies to inventory management, is optimized for better results. Third-party data further enriches this process, offering benchmarks and industry trends that help brands stay ahead. The use of data analytics not only improves operational efficiency but also ensures that marketing efforts resonate with the target audience, driving engagement and conversions.\\nAnalyzing the 'Whys' Behind eCommerce Performance\\nRetail success is not a one-time achievement. High sales in one quarter do not guarantee sustained performance. Understanding why sales were strong in a particular period is essential for replicating that success. For example, if a retailer experiences a spike in sales, identifying the metrics that drove this increase—such as a successful marketing campaign or a popular product launch—provides actionable insights for future strategies.\\nSimilarly, analyzing poor performance is crucial. If a campaign underperforms, brands must identify the root causes to make improvements. Was the targeting off? Or was the targeting right but the audience didn’t find the creatives to be relatable? By pinpointing these issues, brands can refine their approaches and avoid repeating mistakes. For example, if a marketing campaign fails, analyzing factors like audience segmentation, messaging, and ad placement can reveal areas for improvement.\\nThe Answer Is Not Always Simple\\nBrands often oversimplify the reasons behind their eCommerce performance. If revenue dips, they might quickly attribute it to lower traffic and stop there. However, eCommerce outcomes are complex and require a deeper analysis to identify the true causes.\\nIn reality, the drop in revenue could indeed be due to decreased traffic, but what caused the decline in traffic? Perhaps the marketing campaigns didn’t perform as expected. Then the question becomes, what specifically underperformed in the campaigns? It could be incorrect targeting or unrelatable creatives. This process illustrates the importance of drilling down into multiple layers to identify the root cause of eCommerce performance issues.\\nTo find comprehensive answers, brands need to analyze top-level metrics:\\nTraffic Analysis: Examine traffic sources and their impact on sales.\\nConversion Rate Optimization: Improve conversion rates through A/B testing, user feedback, and other techniques.\\nRevenue Drivers: Identify and optimize key revenue drivers.\\nCustomer Retention: Implement strategies for retaining customers and increasing their lifetime value.\\nEach of these metrics can be further divided to gain deeper insights:\\nTraffic Analysis: Break down by channel (organic, paid, referral), geography, and device.\\nConversion Rate Optimization: Segment by landing page performance, checkout process analysis, and user journey mapping.\\nRevenue Drivers: Analyze by product categories, pricing strategies, and promotional effectiveness.\\nCustomer Retention: Assess loyalty program engagement, repeat purchase rates, and customer satisfaction scores.\\nBy thoroughly examining these metrics and their subcategories, brands can find the complex factors affecting their eCommerce performance and develop targeted strategies to address them.\\nTools and Technologies for eCommerce Success\\nGiven the complexity of analyzing multiple metrics accurately, relying solely on human judgment is impractical. Cognitive biases can skew analysis, leading to incorrect conclusions. For example, if sales are low, business owners might blame the marketing team without considering other factors like product demand.\\nTo overcome these challenges, brands need advanced analytics tools that provide accurate insights. Powered by AI and machine learning algorithms, these tools can analyze vast amounts of data, including sales, customer behavior, and marketing performance, to offer a holistic view of the business. Brands can easily identify patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent. For example, an analytics tool might reveal that a decline in sales is due to a drop in repeat purchases rather than a decrease in new customer acquisition. Such insights are invaluable for making strategic decisions that drive growth and improve performance.\\nTakeaway\\nTo repeat success and avoid repeating failures, it is crucial for brands to understand the reasons behind their performance. Data-driven decision-making is essential for dealing with the challenges of the eCommerce matrix. Every eCommerce decision made with the help of data has far more chance of success compared to those based on intuition alone!\\n  Authored By\\n  Prem Bhatia, CEO and Co-Founder Graas\\n  e-commerceBrandsOnline\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nIndia's Lifestyle Market Set to Hit $210 Bn by 2028 with 22 pc Online Growth\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nAug 09, 2024 / 11 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  India's lifestyle market, currently valued at a staggering $130 billion, is on its way to a significant transformation. Fashion dominates this market, accounting for approximately 80 percent, with beauty and personal care (BPC) making up the remainder. Over the next five years, this market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10–12 percent, reaching a projected $210 billion. This growth will be primarily driven by the organized segment, which is gaining traction as consumers increasingly seek quality, branded products.\\nA recent study conducted by Bain & Company in collaboration with Myntra sheds light on the rapid evolution of India's e-lifestyle market. Currently valued at $16–$17 billion in 2023, the e-lifestyle market is expected to more than double to an impressive $40–$45 billion by 2028. This robust growth trajectory is being fueled by a combination of favorable economic conditions and structural shifts in consumer behavior.\\nDriving Factors Behind the Growth\\nThe anticipated growth in India's e-lifestyle market can be attributed to several key factors. First, the easing of short-term inflationary pressures is expected to stimulate consumer spending. Additionally, there are structural shifts that are creating a more favorable demand environment. These include a rise in disposable incomes, a growing base of fashion-forward and digitally native Gen-Z shoppers, and an increasing demand for organized and branded products.\\nThe market is also benefiting from superior customer value propositions offered by online platforms. These include a trendy and wide-ranging selection of products, faster delivery times, easier returns, and a tech-enabled shopping experience. Social media is playing a pivotal role in product discovery, further enhancing the shopping experience. Moreover, the growth of omnichannel access, where consumers can seamlessly transition between online and offline shopping, is bridging the gap between India and more mature e-lifestyle markets like the US, China, and Germany, which boast over 35 percent e-lifestyle penetration. In India, e-lifestyle penetration is projected to grow from 13 percent to an impressive 18–22 percent over the next five years.\\n\\\"India’s e-lifestyle market has come of age in the last few years, with a diverse shopper base. Two out of three online shoppers are from beyond the top 50 cities, one in two are from non-affluent segments, and one in three are Gen-Z. There still exists massive penetration headroom. One in five dollars spent on lifestyle will be online,” said Shyam Unnikrishnan, Partner at Bain & Company.\\nFashion Leading the Charge\\nCurrently, the e-lifestyle market in India is dominated by fashion, which makes up around 75 percent of the market. Within this segment, accessories and women’s apparel are expected to see faster growth compared to other fashion categories. The BPC segment, while smaller, has gained mainstream popularity, with a penetration rate of approximately 16 percent in 2023. This segment is also expected to grow slightly faster than fashion over the next five years, indicating a rising consumer interest in beauty and personal care products.\\nA significant trend identified in the study is the rise of the trend-first fashion market, driven largely by online platforms. With a vast assortment and quicker product refresh cycles, this trend-first market is expected to grow eightfold, reaching $4–5 billion by 2028. Consequently, the online share of trend-first fashion is projected to increase to 50–55 percent, up from the current 30–35 percent. This shift underscores the growing importance of staying ahead of fashion trends and offering consumers the latest styles.\\nThe Evolving Online Shopper\\nIn 2023, more than 175 million consumers across India shopped for lifestyle products online, making an average of 6–7 transactions per year.

These shoppers visit their preferred platform at least once a day on average and make over 25 purchases per year, far exceeding the market average. The study also highlights the growing influence of Gen-Z shoppers, who, despite lower spending per order, transact more frequently.

The study notes an increasing share of India-made products in global brand assortments, driven by enhanced manufacturing capabilities. These include not only cotton textiles but also technical textiles, which are gaining prominence. Brands are working closely with manufacturers to shorten go-to-market (GTM) times, control costs, and enhance agility. The greater role of technology in sourcing is also bolstering India’s position as a fashion-sourcing destination.\\nIndia has emerged as a key market for top global brands, with 90 percent of the top 50 global brands already present in the country. Half of these brands generate over $30 million in revenue from their India operations, reflecting the confidence in India’s potential as a major lifestyle market. The past year has seen the launch or planned launch of over 60 global brands across various segments, including fashion and beauty. These launches span a range of categories, from scale and niche to luxury and new-age brands.\\nThe Role of Online Channels in Brand Expansion\\nThe online channel has played a pivotal role in the entry of global brands into India. \\\"Three in five global brands have entered India via the online channel in the past year, and we are proud to have contributed to the launch of some of these global brands in the country,\\\" said Nandita Sinha, CEO of Myntra. A well-rounded, high-decibel launch, combined with easy discovery, access to insights about Indian consumers, and Myntra's extensive reach to 99 percent of serviceable pin codes, are among the key factors enabling these brands to scale up in the subcontinent.\\nREAD MORE: The Retail Transformation: How 7.6% Economic Growth in FY24 is Redefining India’s Market!\\nScaling Online Sales\\nThe study identifies a common playbook adopted by high-growth brands to scale online sales in India.

This is an explicit acceptance of the fact that enterprises can no longer afford to prioritize financial profitability over environmental costs; the environment is no longer an “externality”. \\nThis mindset is reshaping business priorities, growth strategies, and operations due to global climate change and social divisions. Adverse impacts include inadequate rainfall, high temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and severe flight turbulence. Socio-economic inequities also worsen, leading to unrest and migration.\\nLeaders are consciously considering sustainability aspects when making business decisions due to:\\nBusiness decisions based solely on financial gains, ignoring environmental impacts \\nRegulatory changes holding businesses accountable for environmental and social impacts \\nRising stakeholder activism from customers, employees, and business partners against unsustainable actions\\nWith pervasive digitalization and changing globalization, sustainable commerce demands a shift from Milton Friedman’s 1970s famous assertion that a business’s sole responsibility is to maximize shareholder profits.\\nWhat is the sustainable commerce movement?\\nSustainable commerce requires businesses to prioritize conserving resources and minimizing environmental damage, even if it leads to lower profits, across all strategic and operational aspects of the value chain.\\nMillennials and GenZers, increasingly comprising employees, customers, influencers, and policy makers, strongly support environmental and social issues. Survey show over three out of four employees would consider companies’ sustainability commitments before accepting job offers. \\nThe sustainable commerce paradigm will impact demand, operations, and value chains.

Ensure downstream suppliers adhere to the same standards.\\nGreener logistics options: to reduce carbon footprint, such as using trains instead of trucks and waterways for heavy equipment.\\nGreener Reverse Supply Chains: Create safe disposal channels for end-of-life products. Use third parties to buy and recycle used items from consumers. E-commerce companies can adopt this, selling refurbished products to recoup costs.\\nBusinesses need AI tools to accurately capture and analyze large data sets from various sources, generating actionable insights.\\nWhile sustainable commerce is evident in manufacturing, it applies to all sectors, including service providers.

One of the most significant developments in this transformation is social commerce. As social media platforms continue to evolve, they have increasingly integrated e-commerce functionalities, creating a seamless blend of social interaction and online shopping.\\nSocial commerce refers to the use of social media platforms to facilitate and enhance the buying and selling of products and services online. This integration allows users to discover, research, and purchase products directly within their favorite social media apps. Businesses may leverage the enormous user populations of social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest to increase sales and foster brand loyalty by fusing the power of social networks with e-commerce.\\nSocial commerce influences the inherently social nature of these platforms, where users can share their purchases, leave reviews, and recommend products to their network, creating a community-driven shopping experience. This method goes beyond traditional e-commerce by incorporating elements such as social proof, user-generated content, and real-time engagement, which can significantly influence purchasing decisions.\\nGlobal and Indian Market Trends\\nThe rise of social commerce is evident from recent statistics and market trends. Globally, social commerce sales are projected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2025, accounting for a significant portion of the e-commerce market. In India, social commerce is rapidly gaining traction, driven by the country's high social media usage and growing e-commerce industry. As per a report by Bain & Company, India's social commerce market is expected to grow to $20 billion by 2025, up from $1.5 billion in 2020.\\nConsumers are increasingly turning to social media platforms for shopping, with platforms like Instagram and Facebook leading the way. Instagram's \\\"Shop\\\" feature and Facebook's \\\"Shops\\\" are prime examples of how these platforms are enhancing their e-commerce capabilities to cater to this growing trend. Additionally, the rise of short-video platforms like TikTok has also contributed to the growth of social commerce, with influencers and content creators playing a pivotal role in driving sales through engaging content.\\nBenefits of Social Commerce\\nEnhanced Customer Engagement\\nOne of the primary benefits of social commerce is enhanced customer engagement. Social media platforms are designed for interaction, making them ideal for brands to connect with their audience. Through posts, stories, live videos, and direct messages, businesses can engage with customers in real time, answer queries, and provide personalized recommendations. This level of interaction builds trust and fosters a sense of community, encouraging repeat purchases and brand loyalty.\\nSeamless Shopping Experience\\nSocial commerce offers a seamless shopping experience by integrating the entire customer journey within a single platform. From product discovery to purchase and post-purchase engagement, everything happens within the social media app. Features like shoppable posts, in-app checkouts, and instant customer support streamline the buying process, reducing friction and making it easier for consumers to complete transactions. This convenience is particularly appealing to younger, tech-savvy shoppers who value efficiency and instant gratification.\\nTargeted Advertising\\nSocial media platforms are equipped with sophisticated targeting capabilities, allowing businesses to reach their ideal customers with precision. By leveraging data on user behavior, interests, and demographics, brands can create highly targeted ad campaigns that resonate with specific audiences.\\nGranular Measurement and Analysis\\nFinally, using social commerce lets businesses take advantage of granular measurement and analysis capabilities. Companies can track all kinds of data related to their campaigns including engagement rates, click-throughs, conversions, and more. This data is invaluable for fine-tuning existing strategies as well as developing new ones in order to maximize profits.\\nStrategies for Leveraging Social Media Platforms\\nInfluencer Collaborations\\nCollaborating with influencers is a powerful strategy for leveraging social media platforms for social commerce. Influencers have built trust and credibility with their followers, making their recommendations highly influential. By partnering with influencers, brands can tap into their reach and authenticity to promote products in a relatable and engaging manner. Whether through sponsored posts, unboxing videos, or live shopping events, influencer collaborations can drive significant traffic and sales.\\nInteractive Content\\nCreating interactive content is another effective strategy for driving social commerce. Interactive content, such as polls, quizzes, and live videos, encourages user participation and keeps audiences engaged. Live shopping events, in particular, have gained popularity as they allow brands to showcase products in real-time, answer questions, and offer exclusive discounts. This interactive approach not only boosts engagement but also creates a sense of urgency, prompting immediate purchases.\\nCustomer Reviews and Testimonials\\nCustomer reviews and testimonials play a crucial role in social commerce by providing social proof and building trust. Encouraging satisfied customers to share their experiences on social media can influence potential buyers and drive sales. Brands can feature user-generated content, such as photos and videos of customers using their products, to add authenticity and credibility. Additionally, responding to reviews and addressing feedback shows that the brand values customer opinions, further enhancing trust and loyalty.\\nFuture of Social Commerce\\nEmerging Trends\\nThe future of social commerce is promising, with several emerging trends set to shape the industry. One such trend is the integration of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies. These technologies offer immersive shopping experiences, allowing customers to virtually try on products or visualize them in their environment before making a purchase. This not only enhances the shopping experience but also reduces the likelihood of returns.\\nAnother emerging trend is the rise of social commerce on messaging platforms. Apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are increasingly being used for shopping, with businesses setting up virtual storefronts and offering customer support through these channels. This trend is particularly significant in regions with high mobile penetration, such as India and Southeast Asia.\\nAdvice for Retailers\\n\\nFor retailers looking to capitalize on the rise of social commerce, it is essential to stay agile and adapt to evolving trends. Investing in social media marketing and building a strong presence on key platforms is crucial. Retailers should also focus on creating high-quality, engaging content that resonates with their target audience. Retailers should also explore innovative technologies, such as AR and VR, to offer unique shopping experiences. Lastly, providing exceptional customer service and actively engaging with customers on social media can foster loyalty and encourage repeat business.\\nConclusion\\nThe rise of social commerce represents a significant opportunity for businesses to leverage social media platforms for online sales growth. By integrating social interactions with e-commerce functionalities, social commerce offers enhanced customer engagement, a seamless shopping experience, and targeted advertising. As the industry continues to evolve, retailers must stay ahead of emerging trends and adopt effective strategies to maximize the potential of social commerce. With the right approach, businesses can not only drive sales but also build lasting relationships with their customers in this dynamic digital landscape.\\nIn conclusion, the future of e-commerce is here and businesses must take advantage of it now if they want to maximize profits through social commerce.\\n  -Authored By\\nManish Verma, Co-founder & Director (Marketing & Operations), TruTRTL\\n  Social CommerceMarketing Trendsretail India\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nInfluencers Fuel India's E-Commerce Boom\\nBY - Imran Fazal\\nFeatures Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nJun 13, 2024 / 17 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  India’s digital economy is forecasted to reach an impressive $800 billion by 2030, according to a report from Invest India.

Influencer marketing is a powerful tool; however, it is important to set clear objectives and identify the right influencers to ensure success.”\\nAmazon’s Creator University\\nCurrently valued at $70 billion+, India's online shopping constitutes approximately 7 percent of the country's total retail market, presenting a significant opportunity for growth. The Invest India report highlights that India will lead the online shopping revolution, with an estimated 500 million shoppers by 2030. It also notes the country's increasing internet penetration, with 87 percent of Indian households expected to have internet access by 2025.\\nRecently, Amazon.in launched its Creator University and Creator Connect initiative to help both established and aspiring influencers scale up on Amazon.in. The first Creator Connect event, \\\"A Summer Escape,\\\" was held on June 3, 2024, in Mumbai, focusing on building a community of fashion and lifestyle creators coinciding with Amazon Fashion's Wardrobe Refresh Sale.\\nKishore Thota, Director of Shopping Experience, India & Emerging Markets, Amazon, said, “Amazon recognizes the power of creators and their content. That is why we have invested heavily in building a thriving two-sided marketplace where creators and customers connect. Dedicated teams across product and business functions work tirelessly to develop programs and features that benefit both sides.”\\nThota further added, “We believe creators are essential to serving our customers’ needs. Their content drives brand awareness, product recall, positive brand image, customer loyalty, and ultimately, sales. By fostering a platform where creators can flourish and gain recognition, income, and audience love, we create a win-win situation.”\\nSimilarly, Amazon offers a feature called Amazon Live, an on-site, on-app influencer-led program that provides customers with an interactive, social, and entertaining way to shop. Through Amazon Live, customers can interact with trusted influencers and shop selections from livestreams. Launched in India in September 2022, Amazon Live addresses customers’ needs for product discovery, focused expertise, trust (through the influencer), and value.\\nIt should be noted that the role of influencers in shaping consumer behavior and driving sales has become more critical than ever.

However, 93 percent of retailers said it is “somewhat important” or “very important” to offer generous refund and return policies to win new customers and retain loyal ones. This leaves Indian retailers selling online with a big dilemma. How do they make returns easy, yet discourage fraudulent activity at the same time?\\nDifferent Types of Returns Fraud\\n‘Serial returners’ are shoppers who regularly and deliberately buy multiple items and repeatedly returning them. ‘Wardrobers’ abuse the system by wearing clothes for one occasion only, then sending them back. More overt scams include claiming that an item that arrived, has never arrived, or that the item does not match the product description, or was damaged in transit.\\nOther fraudulent activities include returning shoplifted items, and ‘merchandise exchange’ whereby shoppers purchase a new item, then return an older or non-working version of the same item, using the packaging from the newer merchandise. Such scams are not solely practiced by individuals. Organized international crime rings are often co-ordinating fraudulent returns activities on a grand scale.\\nTime to Take Action\\nRetailers are pushing back. For instance, in 2019, Asos.com said it would begin deactivating[2] the accounts of serial returners on its site. Some fashion brands, including Zara, J.Crew[3] and Uniqlo[4], have begun charging for returns in order to claw back lost revenue.\\nThe key to addressing the scale of these problems is having digital systems in place that will alert retailers and spot which SKUs – and which customers - are problematic. Data analytics of returns patterns is something Asendia can offer clients through the e-PAQ Returns[5] solution. The system provides a full suite of retailer reports and dashboards. The power is in spotting the trends and taking timely action to stamp out returns fraud activity, wherever in the world it is happening.\\nHere are four ways data analytics can assist in the fight against returns fraud:\\nPattern Recognition and Anomaly Detection\\nIt’s possible to process vast amounts of transaction, inventory, and customer data to establish normal shopping patterns and behaviors. By using advanced algorithms, retailers can identify anomalies that might indicate returns fraud. Unusual patterns, such as frequent returns of high-value items, or returns from the same address with different customer names, can be flagged for further investigation. Analysis of the reason for returning can also flag suspicious, repetitive behavior.\\nCustomer Data Analysis\\nRetail loss prevention teams can deploy analytics to detect potential networks of fraudsters working together. By examining shared IP addresses, shipping addresses, and payment methods, retailers can uncover hidden associations that might indicate organized fraud rings. Identifying such networks can help retailers take pre-emptive action to prevent fraud.\\nPredictive Modeling for Fraud Prevention\\nRetailers with a costly returns problem can leverage historical data to assess the likelihood of a particular transaction being fraudulent. These predictive models can factor in variables, such as purchase history, device information, and behavioral patterns. Retailers can then set customizable risk thresholds, automatically flagging or blocking transactions that exceed these thresholds, thereby reducing returns fraud.\\nReal-time Monitoring and Alerts\\nImplementing real-time data analytics allows retailers to monitor transactions as they happen. By using machine learning algorithms, retailers can instantly evaluate each purchase for signs of potential fraud. If suspicious activity is detected, alerts can be sent to fraud prevention teams for immediate action, such as manual review or order cancellation.\\nMake Your Returns Policy Crystal Clear\\nRetailers can protect themselves against fraud by having a clear and stringent returns policy – and always enforcing it. Requesting that customers send a printout of the receipt when returning items can also help, alongside confirmation of address and zip code information, plus the last 4 digits of the payment card used.\\nWell-established parcel shipping partners, who are increasingly handling returns on behalf of retailers, are in a strong position to help retailers manage reverse logistics.\\nLeveraging Market-Specific Insights\\nAccording to a recent report by Asendia, 76 percent of Indian shoppers would be prepared to pay a nominal fee for returning items. This indicates a receptiveness in the Indian market to levying charges on returns, offering retailers an opportunity to deter unnecessary returns and cover some costs.\\nData analytics provides retailers with a powerful arsenal against returns fraud by detecting unusual patterns, and enabling informed decision-making. When better-informed, online stores can cut down on returns fraud and make sure honest shoppers feel safe and confident.\\n[1] https://www.riskified.com/lp/policy-abuse-global-benchmarks-report/\\n[2] https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47820387\\n[3] https://www.jcrew.com/help/returns-exchanges\\n[4] https://faq-uk.uniqlo.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/What-is-your-online-returns-policy\\n[5] https://www.asendia.com/e-paq/returns\\nHelen Scurfield, CEO – Global Returns, Asendia\\n  ecommerceBig DataData Analytics\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nIndia’s E-commerce Set to Hit US$ 300 Billion by 2030\\nBY - Aritra Ghosh\\nFeatures Writer, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nMay 31, 2024 / 7 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The Indian e-commerce industry is on a rapid upward trajectory, poised to surpass the US to become the second-largest e-commerce market globally by 2034.

Prominent data center players in India such as CtrlS Datacenters & Sify Technologies, have been at the forefront of LEED (Leader in Energy and Environmental Design) certified green data centers.\\nThe e-commerce sector aims for carbon neutrality through measures such as carbon offsetting via reforestation, renewable energy investments, sustainable building and waste management practices, and the use of energy management systems for efficiency optimization.\\nThis holistic approach to sustainability extends beyond operational changes; it influences brand image and consumer loyalty. Today's discerning consumers gravitate towards brands that reflect their environmental values, compelling e-commerce companies to align with these expectations. Strategic partnerships and technological innovations are key, enabling businesses to amplify their sustainability impact. Such initiatives not only contribute to environmental health but also bolster brand reputation and consumer trust.\\nThe Green Revolution showcases the potential for aligning economic progress with environmental sustainability, boosting India's global reputation and its role in combating climate change. This movement highlights the importance of innovation, dedication, and collective efforts towards achieving a sustainable future.\\nThe Indian e-commerce sector is not just adapting to current demands but is also driving a shift towards sustainability. This change promotes a balance between commerce and environmental care, ensuring long-term benefits. With actions like green data centers and life cycle assessments, the industry presents a sustainable model, emphasizing the importance of corporate responsibility for a greener planet. This eco-conscious revolution signifies a major step towards a sustainable market landscape.\\nAuthored By\\nPartha Ghosh, Head of Consulting, Digital Experience, Europe, Infosys\\n  Green revolutionSustainabilityretail India\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nIndia Retail Landscape Set for a Recast with AI-Powered Engagement\\nBY - Guest author\\nApr 13, 2024 / 10 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  It is no longer about neon lights and fancy storefronts that dictate the footfall into the retail store, the digital window dressing is the real lure. The pandemic has permanently shifted a chunk of the retail traffic to the digital channel and charted an evolutionary path like never before. Fuelled by rapid digitization, present-day consumers have access to an on-demand economy where they desire to engage with retailers on a channel of their preference at the click of a button and receive answers to a host of queries ranging from order changes and delivery tracking to complaints and returns.\\nMeeting the expectations of personalized and seamless interactions across channels has raised the stakes for retailers. According to a study by Genesys, 80 percent of consumers will buy more from companies that consistently personalize their interactions, anticipate their needs, and proactively offer solutions. Today, the biggest challenge for retailers is automating smarter, adapting faster, and following through with a curated value proposition that caters to clients. By overcoming these challenges, retailers can build loyalty and retention in the long run.\\nWith the rise of e-commerce and digital channels, organizations are witnessing a large influx and increased volume of customer data. This data can provide valuable insights into the consumer psyche if it is tapped meaningfully. However, many retailers are not able to harness the right technology and find it tough to process this large quantity of data to enhance client engagement and loyalty. They inadvertently miss the opportunities that digital promises, such as maintaining seamless experiences, understanding buyer preferences, and expanding client reach.\\nHaving a state-of-the-art cloud contact center can provide retailers with strategic insights into the nature of customer queries, behavior, and pain points, which they can harness to carve out strategies and orchestrate meaningful experiences along the entire journey. However, very often internal silos and complex tasks lead to operational challenges in a contact center, which results in negatively impacting employee engagement, managing resources, and eventually affecting the bottom line. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning can play a vital role here. By marrying automation and logic, employees can utilize tools to gain productivity and efficiency, which can eventually result in improved experiences and business results for the end user. Forrester Research states that organizations that effectively leverage AI can expect an increase of 5-10 percent in their revenues. They can take advantage of AI in contact centers to adapt to increasing demands and improve overall business performance while also using it to improve quality, consistency, and employee experience. Businesses with the right AI tools can predict, listen, understand, and act in real time, allowing them to remove friction for their workforce and provide more personalized services for their customers.\\nHarnessing AI for Predictive Routing & Personalised Engagement\\nMaximising AI for enhancing employee engagement does not entail just adding the latest application as a magic bullet but building an AI strategy that encompasses data, analytics, and the many applications of AI and machine learning -- routing, scheduling, forecasting, predictions, and more. When these elements come together, they provide compelling business outcomes.\\nOf the various components responsible for the success of a contact center, routing ranks high. Most of the contact centers still use queue-based routing, a technology that was developed more than 40 years ago. However, such traditional routines pose severe bottlenecks when new channels are built. It is challenging to align with new demands and alter business rules as queues in such a routing system are inflexible, siloed, and static. All this leads to a dependency on the IT team, which decreases employee efficiency and delivers a high effort and fragmented experience for customers.\\nTo stay competitive, organizations must transition to a predictive routing technology that has the potential to support a larger, omnichannel experience spanning the entire customer journey by harnessing the power of data over time. Here leveraging AI and machine learning,  clients are paired with those agents who are best suited for the customer’s case.\\nToday, predictive engagement is emerging as a powerful tool, enabling organizations to connect with their audience precisely when it matters most. For instance, predictive engagement initiates a proactive chat when a customer abandons their shopping cart. It seamlessly connects the visitor with a dedicated sales representative who can offer guidance through the purchase journey. Lastly, predictive engagement goes above and beyond to ensure that the customer’s resources are dedicated to the most valuable and gratifying inquiries, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience by providing the right level of assistance to the customer.\\nThe Future of Retail: Personalised & Automated Engagement Pave the Way\\nAn e-commerce concept known as connected retail which has the potential to go beyond a transactional approach to lend customers a personalised experience across each touchpoint using digital technologies, is gaining recognition. With a customer-centric approach, retailers can address customer expectations across all channels by understanding who they are, where they came from, and what they want to do next. The key lies in leveraging high-quality insights effectively to connect with the audience better for a more empathetic, personalized approach. Insights can be garnered in real-time, to figure out who, when, and how to engage, and based on the outcome prediction retailers can proactively identify their target audience and surface relevant offers to capture upsell opportunities and drive conversions.\\nWith AI, retailers can adapt quickly to changing business demands, personalize experiences with consumers, and beat the competition through a showcase of value and increased digital bandwidth. Today’s AI can also be implemented and managed with limited resources. Predictive routing and personalized engagement, powered by AI and machine learning, combine employee performance capabilities with user collaborations in a unique manner to accomplish better client and employee interaction. In these times of flux, it is important for businesses to make the most of the next-generation routing solution and take their retail businesses to the next level of growth by delivering incredible experiences powered by transformative AI technologies.\\n  About the Author\\nRaja Laksmipathy, Managing Director of Genesys India\\nA seasoned professional with 30 years of experience in Unified Communications and Collaboration applications.

As the world grapples with sustainability challenges, there's a growing awareness about the excessive packaging accompanying our online purchases. In a recent study commissioned by Amazon, it was revealed that seven out of 10 Indian adults would gladly receive their online orders sans additional delivery packaging, marking a significant shift in consumer attitudes towards eco-conscious practices.\\nThe findings come at a time when essential items are increasingly being delivered to Indian doorsteps without the burden of excess packaging. The rationale behind this shift is compelling – more than half of Indian shoppers cited a desire to minimize packaging material consumption as their primary motivation. This aligns with global efforts by Amazon, which has managed to slash outbound packaging weight per shipment by a staggering 41 percent since 2015, eliminating over 2 million tons of packaging material in the process.\\nThe company has been pioneering sustainable packaging initiatives in India and globally. By utilizing reusable crates or tote bags to protect eligible items, Amazon has managed to bypass the need for supplementary packaging, leading to lighter shipments and reduced carbon emissions per package.\\nHowever, not all items are created equal in the eyes of consumers when it comes to packaging preferences. The study identified certain product categories, such as clothing apparel, detergent, and stationery, where customers are content to receive items in their original packaging with just an address label added. On the other hand, discreet packaging remains crucial for sensitive products like contraceptive devices and medical supplies.\\nAbhinav Singh, Vice President of Operations at Amazon India, emphasized the company's commitment to sustainable practices, stating, \\\"“Like us, our customers really care about reducing packaging, and we’ve made significant progress doing so for years,” said Abhinav Singh, Vice President- Operations, Amazon India. “That said, we aren’t satisfied with continued reduction. Where possible, we want to eliminate packaging altogether.\\n“One way we do this is by working with manufacturers to design packaging that’s capable of shipping safely, without additional paper bags, envelopes or boxes from us. We’ve already achieved a lot, increasing the number of orders shipped to customers with no added delivery packaging in India by 83 percent since 2021. We are working to ship even more deliveries the same way.”\\nTo assuage concerns regarding product safety, the subjects selected items to rigorous drop tests, ensuring they reach customers unscathed. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, Amazon evaluates the durability of manufacturer packaging, customizing shipping solutions based on distance traveled and product fragility. While tech accessories, homeware, and shoes are often shipped with minimal packaging, items requiring extra protection, such as liquids and fragile goods, still warrant additional packaging.\\nDespite the transition towards reduced packaging, customer confidence remains paramount. The study found that one in three respondents felt reassured by the refund or replacement policy for missing items, underscoring the importance of trust in driving sustainable shopping practices.\\nIn tandem with its packaging reduction initiatives, Amazon has positioned itself as a leader in environmental stewardship through initiatives like The Climate Pledge. By committing to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040 and transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy across its operations by 2025, Amazon is setting a precedent for corporate sustainability efforts worldwide.\\nAs consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions, the shift towards minimal packaging in online shopping represents a pivotal moment in the retail landscape. With Amazon spearheading these efforts, there's hope that other industry players will follow suit, ushering in a future where convenience and environmental responsibility go hand in hand.\\n  : eCommerce marketeCommerce LogisticsSustainabilityindia retailretail India\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nTop 3 Predictions for the Retail Sector in 2024\\nBY - Guest author\\nMar 30, 2024 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Given the significant developments in 2023, such as the growth of retail media, generative AI, connected TV (CTV), shoppable content, and digitally enabled stores, 2024 is poised to advance even further and facilitate additional disruptions. According to a study, sales initiated through live commerce could constitute 20 percent of all e-commerce by 2026. Projections indicate that India's e-commerce market will reach $220 billion by 2025, with live commerce contributing over $50 billion in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), as reported by EY India.\\nAI in Retail\\nAI and predictive analytics will continue to drive optimizations like dynamic pricing, fraud prevention, and supply chain management. The use of AI in retail is predicted to grow, providing enhanced efficiency, better decision-making, and a more personalized and easy shopping experience for customers.\\nThe Rise of AI Shopping Agents\\nAI shopping agents, trained on individual customer preferences and favorite influencers, function as virtual stylists and shoppers. These agents can recommend items based on our preferences and style, identify wardrobe gaps, notify us of relevant bargains and deals, and even execute orders on our behalf. This transition from incremental savings to disruptive, personalized experiences showcases AI's capacity to profoundly reshape purchasing behavior and revolutionize the retail industry. Instead of mere optimizations, these AI agents/personalized GPTs could evolve into trusted advisors and purchasing partners.\\nIn 2024 and beyond, numerous AI applications are expected to emerge. Similarly, generative AI stands out as a powerful technology that leverages vast datasets to create personalized experiences and streamline various facets of retail operations. It offers numerous advantages for a variety of purposes and is not limited to a single domain. GenAI extends its capabilities to customer interactions by generating relevant responses in various formats, such as text and visuals, based on real-time data. It can identify upselling and cross-selling opportunities and efficiently handle client inquiries. The real-time capabilities of Gen AI also extend to pricing optimization, allowing it to adjust prices in response to market conditions, demand patterns, and competition pricing.\\nShoppable Content & Live Commerce\\nLive commerce is also transforming the online shopping experience by combining entertainment and quick purchasing. It represents a novel approach to e-commerce that blends real-time engagement with online buying, enabling e-commerce websites to deliver personalized, interactive, and real-time experiences instead of static content.  By harnessing these capabilities, e-commerce websites can enhance user engagement, build trust, and ultimately increase conversions and revenue. One of the primary advantages of live shopping is its ability to elevate the entire e-commerce experience. Through live interactive streaming of videos or events, brands can engage with customers in real-time, making the purchasing process more personalized and enjoyable. Features such as live demonstrations, Q&A sessions, and exclusive offers create a sense of urgency and anticipation, encouraging immediate purchases. In addition to shoppable livestreams, various platforms offer solutions for live auctions, personalized shopping experiences, and e-commerce-related video chat for customer assistance.\\nLive shopping sets itself apart in a crowded e-commerce landscape by offering a unique and compelling purchasing experience. It enables businesses to bridge the gap between in-store and online purchasing experiences, making them more engaging and memorable for customers.\\n  About the Author\\nRanga Jagannath, Senior Director, Agora\\n  indian retail sectorArtificial intelligenceRetail industry\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nSurpassing competition: How Super Apps Can Deliver Great CX with Observability\\nBY - Guest author\\nMar 28, 2024 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Savvy Indian retailers are capitalizing on growing app fatigue to deliver an all-inclusive digital experience to consumers through super apps. The rise of super apps in India like PhonePe and Tata Neu is evidence of the growing customer preference for these all-in-one applications that combine multiple digital services into one single platform. However, the profitability of super apps relies not only on convenience but also on providing excellent digital experiences to customers. \\nAccording to the New Relic State of E-commerce in India report, Indian customers had potential concerns with super apps that were related to bandwidth and storage, including the need for 4G/5G internet capabilities (45 percent), and a lot of storage space on devices (42 percent). Despite strong interest in the segment, reliability is still a key concern for many Indians and represents a hurdle to adoption.\\nScaling confidently without compromising user experience\\nAs super apps add new integrations and scale their user and revenue base, their tech stack naturally becomes more complex, making it hard to pinpoint and resolve issues when they arise. These apps serve millions of customers so any disruptions or downtime will result in significant revenue losses and potential customer churn.\\nIn India, 59 percent of customers cited poor user experience as one of the major reasons for uninstalling an app. The potential for super apps to fail is multifold: high traffic volumes, poor third-party integrations, the lack of adequate monitoring, troubleshooting, and blindspots in the IT environment to name a few. While the reasons are numerous, every time the app crashes, the brand loses face in front of its customers, risking customer attrition, and potential revenue for its business and integrated partners.\\nIrrespective of whether an outage occurs due to problems within the application, the cloud it runs on, or even the customer’s internet connectivity,  the brand will often take the hit for a compromised digital user experience. It’s perhaps why one in three customers will leave a brand behind when encountering a poor experience.\\n \\nScaling confidently requires super apps to deliver a seamless user experience. Full-stack observability helps to solve these problems by giving engineering and technology teams actionable insights into business-impacting issues, ensuring optimal application performance at all times. It also helps to pinpoint any issues with ISPs, SaaS apps, DNS, or third-party providers so engineering teams can find and fix issues proactively and minimize any impact on the customer experience.\\nCreating frictionless transition between services\\nThe key to super app success lies in ensuring smooth transitions between different services. Eliminating each step that creates friction increases the activation rate, ultimately offering super apps a competitive edge. Another strength of super apps is the ability to analyze large volumes of data to learn user behaviors that help to customize the experience. However, making sense of vast amounts of data can be challenging without the right tooling.\\nGlobally, data scientists spend nearly 40% of their time cleaning and organizing data. Teams get bogged down by silos, where data from individual tools inevitably ends up on multi-tabbed spreadsheets, losing crucial context and insight. The same goes for engineers.  For them to be more proactive in improving app reliability, they must be able to make sense of their telemetry data so they can pinpoint its impact on business outcomes. This level of contextualization helps super apps to expand and grow with confidence, but can only be achieved with observability.\\nFull-stack observability platforms are designed to identify patterns proactively as they provide full visibility into applications, storage, services, and networks, ensuring that engineering teams have in-depth visibility into the behavior, performance, and health of the app. The success of super apps are reliant on this level of insight. Without observability, engineering teams run the risk of blind spots that can impact the customer experience, and businesses risk losing those customers to the competition.\\n  Authored by\\nRohit Ramanand, GVP of Engineering India, New Relic \\n  appsDigital Indiaretail India\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nEmbracing the Virtual Frontier: 5 Insights into the Future of Retail\\nBY - Guest author\\nMar 23, 2024 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In retail, the rise of the metaverse and Web 3.0 marks a shift towards new business approaches.

Over the past decade, the growing prominence of E-commerce platforms has drastically transformed the landscape of the Indian fashion retail sector. \\n\\nTo understand the role of E-commerce in the Indian fashion retail industry, we must first delve into its historical context. E-commerce in India was relatively nascent until the early 2000s when the internet began gaining widespread popularity. In 2007, the launch of Flipkart, an online marketplace, marked a turning point for E-commerce in India. Flipkart provided a platform for retailers to sell their products online, fueling the growth of E-commerce in the country. This was followed by the entry of other prominent players such as Amazon and Snapdeal, further accelerating the adoption of online shopping among Indian consumers.\\n\\nIn the vast fashion landscape, MYNTRA and AJIO have played a crucial role in curating and personalizing the shopping experience for their customers. These platforms employ big data analysis and machine learning algorithms to understand individual preferences and provide tailored recommendations. By employing advanced technologies, MYNTRA and AJIO have revolutionized how consumers discover and choose fashion, rendering each shopping experience highly personalized.\\n\\nE-commerce platforms have also played a significant role in bridging the gap between fashion designers and consumers. In the past, small-scale designers struggled to find a market for their creations due to their limited reach. However, E-commerce has provided them with a global platform to showcase their designs and sell directly to consumers, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This has given rise to a thriving ecosystem of independent designers who can now compete with established fashion brands. As a result, the Indian fashion retail industry has become more diverse and inclusive, fostering creativity and innovation.\\n\\nSeveral influential individuals have contributed to the field of E-commerce in the Indian fashion retail industry. Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, the founders of Flipkart, were pioneers in introducing E-commerce to the Indian market. Their entrepreneurial spirit and vision revolutionized the way Indians shop for fashion. Similarly, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, played a crucial role in popularising E-commerce in India through the launch of Amazon India, which became a major player in the fashion retail sector.\\n\\nDespite the numerous benefits, the role of E-commerce in the Indian fashion retail industry also presents challenges. One of the main concerns is the impact on traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Many small retailers have struggled to compete with the convenience and affordability offered by online platforms. This has led to several store closures and job losses, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas where E-commerce penetration is high. Additionally, counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers pose a significant threat to the credibility of e-commerce platforms, undermining consumer trust.\\n\\nHowever, the future of E-commerce in the Indian fashion retail industry looks promising. The rapid growth of internet penetration, especially through smartphones, has fueled the adoption of E-commerce among a large section of the population. This presents an enormous opportunity for players in the industry to tap into the potential of a vast consumer base. Moreover, the advancements in technology, such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality, hold the potential to enhance the online shopping experience, making it more personalized and immersive.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the role of E-commerce in the Indian fashion retail industry has reshaped the way business is conducted and revolutionized consumer shopping habits. The historical context, key figures, and impact we have discussed shed light on the transformative power of E-commerce in this sector. While there are both positive and negative aspects to consider, the future looks promising as E-commerce continues to evolve and adapt to the changing needs and expectations of Indian consumers. The role of influential individuals and potential developments highlight the potential for continued growth and innovation in the Indian fashion retail industry through E-commerce.\\nAuthored By\\nVedant Bang, Director, Thomas Scott India\\n  apparel fashionretail Indiaecommerce\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nBig Basket's 10-Minute Delivery, 10-Minute Cooking Proposition\\nBY - Imran Fazal\\nFeatures Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nMar 05, 2024 / 5 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In a significant move, bigbasket, a notable entity under the Tata group, unveiled its latest venture, the Precia brand, in collaboration with renowned Padma Shree Awardee Chef Sanjeev Kapoor.

There are 7,000 listed companies in India and one hundred thousand startups. Many startups are in Maharashtra, and one hundred new startups are emerging in India every day. India is the largest SMB market globally, making it one of the most exciting markets today.”\\nHe further added, “When we look at the supply lens and examine Microsoft's data, one out of four projects on AI in GitHub today is run out of India. Every sixth AI researcher in the world is from India. In the next ten years, 25 percent of the global workforce will come from India, meaning every fourth worker in the world will be from India.”\\nDiscussing the growing influence and power of Artificial Intelligence, Chandok mentioned, “Last night, my 12-year-old daughter was creating text-to-video, and she told me that AI will change her life. She is an artist; she draws and paints. This also indicates how the younger generation perceives AI.”\\nExpanding on this, Chandok continued, “People will stop searching and instead have conversations. I have stopped searching myself; in fact, I was conversing with my Copilot to understand what is happening at the event and what I should speak about. We have shifted from searching to genuine conversations. This is not just chat drama anymore. These are sophisticated engines providing reasoning within.”\\nRegarding his personal perspective, Chandok remarked, “People say AI is overhyped, but I think it's not hyped enough. The next generation, which will use this in the next few years, will have much higher expectations of what technology can do for them. So, how you build it for that generation, how you build it for that future, will be really interesting to see.\\\"\\nChandok also emphasized that those who do not embrace AI, risk falling behind in the rapidly evolving technological landscape. He encouraged Indian developers to seize the \\\"lifetime opportunity\\\" to become unstoppable by learning to use and deploy AI effectively.\\nHe concluded, “If you are not learning AI, you are falling behind. I myself spend 30 minutes a day to learn more about AI. Technology is changing every day, and it has been 15 months since ChatGPT was launched. The speed of technology diffusion is unlike anything I have seen in my life, and it is advancing very rapidly. My call to action for everyone is to find a way to learn, otherwise, we will all fall behind.”\\n  retail IndiaMicrosoftArtificial intelligence\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nMaharashtra is the Startup Capital of India: Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis\\nBY - Imran Fazal\\nFeatures Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nFeb 19, 2024 / 5 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Igniting the debate on the Mumbai versus Bengaluru startup ecosystem, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, during Mumbai Tech Week, remarked that Maharashtra is the startup capital while Pune is the tech capital of the country. Fadnavis also mentioned that the Maharashtra government is in active talks with 2-3 global tech giants to help them establish their tech operations in Maharashtra.\\nDevendra Fadnavis, Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, launched Mumbai Megapolis Metaverse during Mumbai Tech Week organized by Tech Entrepreneurs Association of Mumbai (TEAM).\\nDuring the Fireside Chat with Rishi Darda, Joint MD and ED of Lokmat Media Group, remarked, “I must tell you that when we talk about the startup ecosystem, Bengaluru and Hyderabad are boasted as good startup ecosystems, but let me tell you that the actual reality, as per the numbers, is that Maharashtra is the startup capital.”\\nFadnavis said, “The highest number of startups which are functional (those that have not moved to Bengaluru) are in Maharashtra, and the highest number of Unicorns, out of all the registered startups in India, are in Maharashtra, while 25 percent of the Unicorns are also housed in Maharashtra. Ultimately, the future of the startup ecosystem is Artificial Intelligence and technology, and now with the capacity of Data Center that we have created. I think that the entire future belongs to Mumbai.”\\nElaborating on the issue of affordability of living in Mumbai, Fadnavis said, “Mumbai had become unaffordable for many, and that is why people shifted to other cities. But now, we are making Mumbai affordable. Once Mumbai becomes affordable, it will be the city of dreams. One should note that nobody wants to move out of Mumbai and in fact, people want to come to Mumbai.”\\nTalking about future plans for the tech startups in Maharashtra, Fadnavis said, “We have planned something very big with TEAM for the tech and Startup industry. TEAM really represents Mumbai and this will bring back Mumbai to its true position. Maharashtra was the first state in 2016 in which we came up with the startup policy and startup fund. We are now pushing to create a new startup policy to make the ecosystem much more effective and make it most attractive in the country. The future of startups belongs to Maharashtra.”\\nIt was in 2023, Google began construction on its new Hyderabad campus. The office, which will be a 3 million ft structure, and located in the Financial District of the city, will be Google’s largest office anywhere outside the US, and its second-largest office worldwide after the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, California.\\nTalking about the big tech companies investing in other states rather than in Maharashtra, Fadnavis said, “I must tell you that the biggest investment in data centers is being made in Maharashtra. Recently, we went to Pune and entered into an MoU with Google, the search engine giant, to utilize artificial intelligence for agriculture, healthcare, and education solutions.”\\nHe elaborated further and said, “The country head of Google told me that we will pitch Pune as the tech city. So today, not just Mumbai, Pune is the tech capital. In fact, many times Pune is overshadowed by Mumbai. But every tech company is present in Pune. Not only Pune but they are present in Nagpur and other Tier II cities as well.”\\nDiscussing the role of government in bringing tech companies to the state, Fadnavis said, “As a government, we are in active talks with tech giants to offer them good facilities. They do not require anything from the government, but they just require good governance, which of course, we are committed to giving. There are 2-3 very big tech companies coming to Maharashtra soon.”\\n  MaharashtrabengaluruGoogleMumbai\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nFrom Likes to Profits: How Indian Entrepreneurs are Mastering Social Media Sales Strategies\\nBY - Guest author\\nFeb 03, 2024 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  India’s dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem has undergone a remarkable transformation as the mindset of hardworking entrepreneurs shifts from merely contributing towards maximizing profits to employing innovative social media marketing strategies.

At the recent Microsoft AI Tour in Mumbai, Puneet Chandok, Microsoft Country Head, hailed India as a formidable force in this AI-driven era.\\nMicrosoft commenced 2024 with a groundbreaking move, launching the professional version of its AI chatbot, Copilot. Boasting capabilities such as custom GPTs and seamless Office integration, this innovation positions Microsoft at the forefront of AI advancements.\\nThe impact of Microsoft's AI tools on the company's performance is evident, with an impressive 18% year-on-year revenue surge, exceeding $60 billion from September to December. Satya Nadella, Microsoft's Chairman and CEO, emphasized the shift from theoretical discussions on AI to its widespread application across their tech stack.\\nNadella said, \\\"We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.

Precise, timely, and error-free deliveries can lead to satisfied customers, while delays or mistakes can result in dissatisfaction. As the e-commerce landscape evolves, the integration of automation and robotics emerges as a transformative solution to overcome the challenges associated with last-mile logistics. Automation is at the forefront of this transformative shift and is actively developing solutions to redefine last-mile logistics and enhance efficiency.\\nEfficiency in last-mile logistics begins within distribution centers and warehouses. Robotic arms, conveyor systems, and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are increasingly deployed to enhance order fulfilment speed. The use of robots in Indian warehouses is on the rise, recognizing their potential to improve operational efficiency. However, careful consideration of factors like existing infrastructure and workforce adaptability is crucial for successful integration.\\nDrones and other last-mile delivery technologies, such as autonomous delivery systems, enroute manufacturing, robotic stores on wheels, and delivery lockers, are emerging as promising solutions for the future of e-commerce. These innovative solutions are part of the vision for the future of e-commerce. Combined with the expertise, these can revolutionize delivery processes, making them faster, more cost-effective, and more reliable.\\nMajor e-commerce retailers continue to innovate, pushing for fast delivery options. Consumer expectations for convenience, speed, and affordability have risen, placing substantial pressure on retailers' bottom lines. Shorter delivery times have become a determining factor for online shoppers, influencing purchasing decisions.\\nThe rise of automation has revolutionized e-commerce fulfilment, streamlining operations from order processing to shipping. Robotics, AI, and machine learning are examples of technologies have significantly improved efficiency, reduced errors, and enhanced overall productivity. Faster order processing, accurate inventory updates, and reliable shipping information enhance customer satisfaction and foster brand loyalty.\\nTechnology-driven fulfilment systems empower e-commerce businesses to scale efficiently, adapt to fluctuating demand, and make data-driven decisions. Cloud-based platforms and on-demand warehousing solutions provide greater flexibility. Data analytics offer valuable insights into customer behavior, inventory levels, and shipping patterns.\\nFulfilment centers equipped with automation technologies are becoming crucial for quick order processing in hyper-urban locations. These centers contribute to fulfilling the instant gratification needs of customers and form a significant part of automating the last mile.\\nWhile integrating automation technologies promises transformative benefits, it has challenges. The substantial initial investment, regulatory hurdles, safety concerns, and the essential role of human involvement in handling exceptions and customer interactions must be considered. The last mile is among the most expensive and challenging parts of the delivery process. The perennial debate on whether customers are willing to pay for deliveries and returns has led companies to seek ways to optimize, automate, and reduce the cost of last-mile delivery. Challenges like training and retaining last-mile delivery executives are addressed through automation, reducing dependency and minimizing errors.\\nLast-mile delivery automation is the final piece of the puzzle in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce. Whoever successfully solves this puzzle stands to gain the greatest advantage. While challenges exist, the integration of automation and robotics holds the key to shaping the future of last-mile delivery, offering businesses the opportunity to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and meet the ever-growing expectations of online shoppers. The journey toward an automated last mile is not without obstacles. Still, the rewards in terms of customer satisfaction, operational excellence, and market leadership make it a strategic imperative for e-commerce players worldwide.\\nNirav Doshi, Founder and Managing Director, NIDO Group\\n  eCommerce Logisticsindia retailretail IndiaAutomation\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nRedefining the Online Shopping Landscape: Unveiling Shifting Trends and Growth Patterns\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nJan 29, 2024 / 5 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In the ever-evolving landscape of online shopping, the traditional dominance of metros and Tier I cities is undergoing a transformation. While comprising only 14 percent of the total population, these urban centers command a significant 43 percent share of online shoppers, according to a recent report by Alliance Bernstein. However, as the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, growth patterns are experiencing a notable shift.\\nAs we navigate the post-COVID era, the dynamics of online shopping are undergoing a profound transformation. The expansion into Tier II and beyond, the normalization of growth patterns, and the influence of seasonal trends underscore the resilience and adaptability of the online market. The evolving landscape presents both challenges and opportunities, making it imperative for internet companies to stay agile and responsive to ever-changing consumer behaviors.\\nChanging Trends\\nThe overall monthly shopper base (MTUs) has surged, constituting 31 percent of Active User Base (ATUs), a considerable leap from the pre-COVID figure of 23 percent. This signals a maturation of the online user base, with an evident rise in the frequency of online shopping activities. Concurrently, internet companies are strategically expanding their supply chains into Tier II and beyond, capitalizing on improving consumer bases and ordering metrics in these cities.\\nPost-COVID Normalization of Growth\\nAcross various internet sub-segments, user growth is gradually normalizing after the initial COVID-induced traction. Particularly, in severely under-penetrated markets like grocery delivery, which accounted for less than 1 percent of total grocery retail spend, there was a remarkable surge in active user base, peaking at an impressive 228 percent YoY growth in July 2022. Meanwhile, slightly mature sectors such as E-Commerce and Fashion continue to witness sustained growth rates, fueled by increased competition from a plethora of Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) platforms.\\nOTT's Uptick\\nThe Over-The-Top (OTT) segment experienced an uptick towards the end of the year, showcasing a 10 percent increase in Monthly Active Users (MAUs) in July-23, which escalated to an impressive 55 percent increase in MAUs by November-23. This surge was attributed to the broadcast of World Cup screenings, especially in cricket (ICC World Cup, T20) and football (FIFA World Cup). Noteworthy gainers in this arena were Jio Cinema and Disney+Hotstar, boasting exclusive broadcasting rights.\\nSeasonality Trends\\nThree sectors have emerged as notable examples of strong seasonality trends. Firstly, in the realm of E-Commerce, the festive season in October drives the highest uptick in active user base, culminating in end-of-year sales across various categories. Secondly, Fashion Commerce, particularly apparel-led firms, experiences two festive seasons each year, with Q1 and Q3 being the strongest quarters, propelling user growth through end-of-season sales. Lastly, Digital OTT's key growth driver lies in sports content viewership, primarily cricket and football, with platforms like Jio Cinema and Disney+Hotstar securing exclusive broadcasting rights.\\n  Online ShoppingeCommerce TrendsE-commerce industry\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nGen AI Takes Center Stage: 71 pc of Retailers Set to Adopt within Next 12 Months\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nJan 19, 2024 / 7 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The retail industry, recognized for its adaptability, is standing at the threshold of a transformative era with the advent of Generation AI (Gen AI). Traditionally relying on data to predict consumer behavior and manage inventories, the industry is now poised to leverage Gen AI for unprecedented insights and efficiency gains across the entire retail value chain. Here we explore the potential impact of Gen AI on the retail landscape.\\nGen AI in Retail: A Paradigm Shift\\nTraditionally reliant on data for predicting consumer behavior and managing inventories, the retail sector is now gearing up to leverage Gen AI for a seismic shift in operations. Recent findings from a comprehensive survey conducted by EY underscores this readiness, revealing that 6 percent of the surveyed audience has already implemented Gen AI, while a staggering 71 percent within the retail sector plans to adopt it within the next 12 months.\\nThe Promise of Gen AI in Retail\\nGen AI touted as the next frontier in artificial intelligence, holds the promise of revolutionizing the retail experience by tapping into vast repositories of unstructured data. The survey projects current AI investments in the retail sector, estimated at $5 billion, to skyrocket to $31 billion by 2028. An overwhelming 88 percent of respondents within the retail sector believe that Gen AI will have a medium to high impact on their business.\\nImpact Areas: Beyond Customer Experience\\nWhile 76 percent of respondents foresee the highest impact on customer experience, the industry is also actively exploring Gen AI's potential impact on product innovation (65 percent), cost reduction (54 percent), and the entire value chain (50 percent). This signals a comprehensive approach, where Gen AI is seen as a catalyst for positive change across various aspects of retail operations.\\nEconomic Implications: Gen AI's Contribution to Profitability\\nAccording to the EY report, by 2025, Gen AI could potentially elevate the retail sector’s profitability by a substantial 20 percent. The technology not only reduces overheads but also has the potential to significantly boost sales through tailored consumer experiences. This economic implication positions Gen AI as a critical driver of financial success for retailers.\\nGlobal Hub: India's Potential in Gen AI Retail Solutions\\nGiven its IT prowess, India is positioned to emerge as a global nucleus for Gen AI retail solutions. Even local retailers can leverage Gen AI tools to provide 'hyper-local' personalized shopping experiences, contributing to the technology's global adoption.\\nIndustry Insights and Leadership Perspective\\nAngshuman Bhattacharya, National Leader – Consumer Product and Retail Sector, EY India, shared valuable insights, emphasizing that Gen AI is not just a technological leap but a seismic shift in how retailers adapt, innovate, and enhance customer experiences. He stressed the importance of leadership in navigating the AI revolution, balancing innovation with the responsibility to craft a future where technology enriches shopping experiences with integrity and transparency.\\nChallenges and Ethical Considerations: Privacy at the Forefront\\nDespite the enthusiasm for Gen AI, the retail industry faces challenges and ethical dilemmas, particularly concerning privacy. As the technology promises valuable insights through features like real-time promotions using location tracking, transparency in data usage becomes imperative. The survey reveals that 80 percent of organizations express low-to-moderate readiness, citing unclear use cases and a skills gap. Currently, 82 percent prefer partnerships with external tech providers for Gen AI implementation.\\nREAD MORE: India's E-Retail Market Poised to Soar Beyond $160 Billion by 2028\\nNavigating the Gen AI Revolution in Retail\\nAs the retail industry embraces the Gen AI revolution, the integration of this technology brings with it a responsibility to address privacy, ethical considerations, and workforce readiness. Industry leaders must navigate this transformative era, ensuring that Gen AI not only drives profits but also enhances shopping experiences with integrity and transparency. The journey toward a future shaped by Gen AI requires a delicate balance between innovation and responsibility, marking a new chapter in the evolution of the retail landscape.\\n  Artificial intelligenceIndian retail industryDigital technology\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nThe Phygital Edge: Cohesive Online and Offline Engagement to Skyrocket Customer Satisfaction\\nBY - Guest author\\nJan 17, 2024 / 8 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Even though online shopping has become a staple choice for Indian consumers, physical stores are still popular destinations. Little wonder, then, that a digitally enabled physical space (with the best of both worlds) holds all the aces today in customer engagement.\\nTake, for instance, the sports gear brand Decathlon, which provides hassle-fee shopping with a phygital approach. With features like scan and go, a virtual reality zone, and a welcome zone at its store, Decathlon has seamlessly fused its physical stores with online buying experiences.\\nThis shift isn’t just limited to popular apparel retailers and extends to the D2C stratosphere. Changing the face of the Kirana ecosystem are marquee players like Reliance Retail and D-Mart. Reliance has enhanced its D2C offerings with JioMart, and D-Mart has launched D-Mart Ready, the new formats that seamlessly combine physical retailing with online shopping.\\nWhy the Shift to Phygital Engagement\\nBecause the Indian customers say so!\\nIndians actively seek brands that go above and beyond after that first purchase. Consider a scenario where brand A, a show retailer, sells a pair of Oxfords to a customer, takes their money, and ends the interaction with a “Thank you for your order” email with the shipping details. Now imagine another shoe retailer, brand B, follows the same path but doesn’t end the interaction at the shipping details email. Brand B reaches out to the customer with relevant shoe recommendations of Brogues (a formal-wear shoe) on WhatsApp, aligned with the customer’s interest in Oxfords (also a formal-wear shoe). The customer mentioned above gets relevant coupon codes in their email and priority notifications for sales, referral codes, etc. There is no need to specify which of the two brands secures a loyal customer just from that single transaction.\\nThe bottom line is that customers expect consistent engagement across all channels. In fact, siloed messaging across channels is one of the primary reasons for negative customer experiences. \\nThe findings from a recent study on the personalization pulse of Indian consumers corroborate this sentiment. A significant proportion of consumers surveyed (40.5 percent) said they interact with a brand across 2-3 channels before making a purchase. Therefore, brands that respond with a cohesive customer experience that is consistent and seamless across various channels to meet the diverse preferences of their customers will stay ahead of the game.\\nSo, What’s the Hold-up?\\nWhile the perks of having an omnichannel/phygital customer engagement strategy are numerous, a couple of issues hamper adopting this approach for the better.\\n● Data silos are one of the biggest barriers brands face while adopting an omnichannel strategy. When confronted with isolated and unconnected data, brands have to look into manually merging segmented data gathered from different channels and sources. Naturally, the entire process becomes quite expensive and time-consuming.\\n● Conversations across all channels must be consistent and aligned completely. It is frustrating for the customers if the brand engages with them through contradictory communication. Channels have to collaborate their data in real-time to offer seamless omnichannel experiences.\\nChoosing the Right Engagement Partner to Ensure Maximum ROI\\nThe cornerstone of a successful omnichannel approach is building strong customer relationships through personalized and highly satisfactory shopping experiences. Over time, the direct results are increased average order values (AOV) and higher retention rates. However, as mentioned before, creating consistent customer experiences across channels takes time and effort. To overcome these challenges, brands should invest in an insights-led customer engagement platform (or CEP).\\nWhy?\\nWell, such an AI-powered platform can:\\nHelp brands garner deep-level insights like what the most-used channels are by their customers\\nMap entire customer journeys\\nIdentify gaps between channels that are causing friction in the customers’ experiences\\nCreate a unified engagement strategy across channels that gets optimized in real-time.\\nFurthermore, a well-equipped CEP helps optimize costs (a one-stop solution to say goodbye to multiple tools and channel providers) and increases operational efficiency significantly (through AI-powered functionalities, reducing the manual effort required to orchestrate campaigns).\\nAn integrated omnichannel/phygital strategy can solidify a brand’s footing in the customers’ hearts, ergo, keeps them coming back for more. It all boils down to who the brand’s trusted engagement partner is and how they utilize the platform. As rightfully quoted by Sean Gerety, “The technology you use impresses no one. The experience you create with it is everything.”\\n     Author: Raviteja Dodda, CEO & Co-Founder, MoEngage\\n  india retailretail India\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nVibrant Gujarat 2024: Charting the Future of Indian E-commerce\\nBY - Aritra Ghosh\\nFeatures Writer, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nJan 11, 2024 / 7 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The ongoing Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit 2024 is not merely a congregation of leaders and policymakers; it is a melting pot of ideas and strategies that promise to shape the future of various industries.

Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel's launch of IndiaHandmade.com last year, an online platform for artisan weavers, exemplifies the state's commitment to digitalization. Partnerships with Flipkart and Amazon further illustrate Gujarat's dedication to supporting local businesses in reaching a global audience.\\nA Vision for Viksit Bharat@2047\\nThe seminar concluded with a vision for the future - 'Viksit Bharat@2047.' The discussions not only highlighted the opportunities presented by progressive digitalization but also underscored the need for inclusive growth, where every segment of the economy, from large businesses to grassroots entrepreneurs, can thrive.\\nAs India inches closer to becoming the world's second-largest e-commerce industry, it is imperative to address the challenges and leverage the opportunities that digitalization brings.

The study highlights key factors contributing to this growth, such as affordable data, enhanced logistics and fintech infrastructure, and robust digital consumer ecosystems.\\nCurrent Scenario and Growth Projections\\nAs of 2023, the Indian e-retail market is expected to range between $57-60 billion, with an annual shopper base of approximately 240 million. This represents an annual addition of $8-12 billion since 2020. Despite this substantial growth, online spending in India constitutes only 5-6 percent of total retail spending, indicating vast potential for expansion. In comparison, the United States and China boast online spending percentages of 23-24 percent and 35 percent, respectively.\\nThe report anticipates a rebound in the market, with growth levels reaching 23-25 percent in the coming years. By 2028, the e-retail market is poised to surpass $160 billion, showcasing massive headroom for growth.\\nDriving Factors and Opportunities\\nThe report underscores the enduring fundamentals of India's e-retail industry, including factors such as affordable data, improved logistics, and a thriving fintech infrastructure. With 94-95 percent of retail spending still happening offline, there is immense scope for the e-retail sector to capture a larger share of the market as GDP per capita increases, particularly beyond the $4,000 mark.\\nCurrently, the per capita income in India stands at around $2,600, and as this figure rises, there is an expected surge in online spending, particularly on discretionary products. The report suggests that the majority of internet users in India, over 60 percent, are yet to embrace online shopping, highlighting the untapped potential within the market.\\nExpanding Seller Ecosystem\\nThe seller ecosystem in India is rapidly expanding, with twice as many sellers added in 2022 compared to the previous year. Notably, around two-thirds of these new sellers originate from Tier II and smaller cities, indicating a democratization of the e-retail landscape beyond metropolitan areas. More than half of the total seller base is concentrated in seven major cities, including Delhi NCR, Surat, Jaipur, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Kolkata.\\nEmergence of New Business Models\\nThe e-retail industry in India is witnessing the emergence of innovative business models to cater to evolving consumer needs. These include Quick Commerce (Q-commerce) platforms, Hyper-Value Commerce, Inspiration-Led Commerce (Live Commerce), and Fast Fashion.\\nQ-commerce, in particular, has experienced significant growth, with orders doubling over the past year and accounting for a substantial portion (40-50 percent) of India's e-grocery spending. The Hyper-Value sector has also witnessed substantial growth, with its share of overall e-retail expanding five times between 2020 and 2022.\\nIn conclusion, the e-retail landscape in India is poised for significant growth, driven by factors such as affordable data, improved logistics, and a flourishing digital ecosystem. The projections of the market surpassing $160 billion by 2028 underscore the tremendous potential within the sector. As the seller ecosystem expands, new business models emerge, and online spending continues to rise, the Indian e-retail market is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the country's retail landscape in the years to come.\\n  e-retailRetail industryOnline Shopping\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nRole of VMI in Elevating Supply Chain Management for Indian Businesses\\nBY - Guest author\\nJan 09, 2024 / 7 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In the dynamic landscape of today's business environment, effective supply chain management is a critical determinant of success. As Indian businesses strive for operational excellence, Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) emerges as a strategic solution to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and elevate supply chain performance. In this innovative model, the supplier assumes a more proactive role, engaging in continuous monitoring of inventory levels, forecasting demand trends, and autonomously replenishing stock as needed. The primary goal of VMI is to create a seamless and efficient inventory management process that benefits both the supplier and the buyer. This method goes beyond the traditional buyer-initiated replenishment process, introducing a more dynamic and synchronized relationship between the two parties.\\nKey Components of Vendor-Managed Inventory\\nReal-Time Visibility: Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) offers real-time visibility into inventory levels, providing businesses with accurate data for informed decision-making. Leveraging advanced technologies such as IoT and RFID, VMI ensures that inventory data is continually updated, thereby minimizing the risks associated with stockouts or overstock situations.\\nDemand Forecasting: A key strength of VMI is its capacity to accurately forecast demand. Utilizing data analytics and analyzing historical consumption patterns, suppliers can anticipate future requirements, reducing the likelihood of stock imbalances and optimizing inventory management.\\nAutomated Replenishment: VMI streamlines the replenishment process by introducing automation. This feature enables suppliers to proactively restock inventory levels, reducing the need for manual intervention. The automated replenishment not only enhances efficiency but also ensures timely deliveries, minimizing disruptions in the supply chain.\\nTrends Shaping the Adoption of VMI\\nTechnology Integration: The integration of cutting-edge technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, is increasingly prevalent in VMI systems. These technologies play a pivotal role in enhancing predictive analytics, providing businesses with more accurate demand forecasts and ultimately contributing to more efficient inventory management.\\nCollaborative Partnerships: Indian businesses are increasingly recognizing the significance of establishing strong collaborative partnerships with their suppliers. These relationships are built on principles of transparency, trust, and a shared commitment to operational efficiency. By fostering these collaborative ties, businesses aim to create a more integrated and responsive supply chain.\\nMulti-Location VMI Models: A notable trend in India is the proliferation of multi-location VMI models. This approach allows businesses to synchronize inventory management across various locations, thereby optimizing the supply chain on a broader scale. The adoption of multi-location VMI models reflects a strategic effort to enhance coordination and efficiency in managing inventory across diverse geographical areas.\\nThe Impact of VMI\\nImproved Efficiency and Cost Savings: VMI significantly improves operational efficiency and generates substantial cost savings by automating inventory management processes. The reduction in manual intervention streamlines operations, enabling businesses to optimize order quantities, minimize carrying costs, and achieve overall cost-effectiveness in their supply chain.\\nEnhanced Customer Satisfaction: The implementation of VMI ensures a consistent and reliable supply of products, allowing businesses to meet customer demands promptly. This reliability positively impacts customer satisfaction and fosters loyalty, as customers can rely on businesses to consistently deliver the products they need.\\nRisk Mitigation: VMI plays a crucial role in mitigating risks associated with stockouts or excess inventory. The system's emphasis on accurate demand forecasting and timely replenishments equips businesses to navigate uncertainties and disruptions in the supply chain effectively. This risk mitigation aspect contributes to the overall resilience and stability of Indian businesses adopting VMI practices.\\nIn the intricate landscape of contemporary supply chain management, Vendor-Managed Inventory emerges as a pivotal catalyst for transformative change in Indian businesses. Embracing VMI and aligning with prevailing industry trends enables businesses to strategically position themselves for enduring growth, operational excellence, and a distinctive competitive advantage in the dynamic marketplace. A great VMI program ensures shorter lead times, greater transportation planning, and improved customer experience.

Examining the broader industry canvas, we delve into the overarching trends and narratives that shaped the narrative of e-commerce, with a focus on insights from industry leaders, and a synthesis of the journeys undertaken by Myntra and Snapdeal.\\nThe E-Commerce Tapestry: Industry Insights\\nMacro-Level Growth and Consumer Adoption\\nAt a macro level, e-commerce witnessed an outstanding 26 percent year-on-year order volume growth, reflecting the robustness of the industry. The transformation in consumer preferences, inclining towards innovative product categories and a surge in awareness of sustainable options, has been a pivotal driver of this growth.\\nTiered Triumph\\nOne of the standout trends was the remarkable surge in e-commerce adoption from Tier II, III, and IV cities. Over 65 percent of prime members who participated in the festive season shopping hailed from these smaller towns, a substantial increase from the previous year's 50 percent. This shift signifies the democratization of e-commerce, reaching deeper into the heart of India.\\nSMBs and Artisans Shining\\nIn a heartening turn of events, the festive season witnessed not only the traditional success of blue-chip companies but also a notable rise of Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs), women entrepreneurs, and artisans. A substantial 30 percent increase in SMB participation during the festive season, coupled with a 35 percent surge in sales within the initial 48 hours, paints a picture of inclusivity and economic empowerment.\\nSeller Success Beyond Metros\\nSellers from Tier II and III cities, often overlooked in the grand narrative, emerged as significant contributors. Over 65 percent of sellers who received sales were from these smaller cities, fueled by a robust distribution network that ensured almost 50 percent of all orders were delivered within 2 days or less pan India.\\nIn the words of Mr. Anuj Bhatia, Founder of eTrade, \\\"Apart from the buyers, sellers from Tier II and III cities also witnessed successful strides all around the year. This has been complemented by a large distribution network, making 2023 a year full of opportunities and growth for the industry.\\\"\\nE-Commerce Giants: Myntra and Snapdeal's Unique Stories\\nMyntra's Fashion Democracy\\nMyntra, a stalwart in the fashion e-commerce space, embarked on a journey to democratize fashion in India. The platform's milestones in 2023 spoke volumes about its ability to resonate with diverse consumer segments. “From crossing the 75 million mark in new app users to achieving a 100 percent year-on-year growth in loyal customers, our success mirrors a larger narrative of inclusivity,” said Myntra’s spokesperson.\\nSnapdeal's Niche in Value E-Commerce\\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Snapdeal carved its niche in value e-commerce. By strategically curating its product selection, with over 90 percent of items priced below Rs 1,000, Snapdeal fostered loyalty from budget-conscious consumers. “Our success lies in recognizing the value-seeking, middle-income users predominantly located in Tier II+ cities, offering a wide selection of quality, value-priced products,” stated Himanshu Chakrawarti, CEO, Snapdeal.\\nKey Industry Strategies and Technological Leaps\\nDiversity in Product Categories\\nBoth Myntra and Snapdeal observed shifts in consumer preferences in specific product categories. Categories like ethnic wear, sports, and casual footwear, and wearables saw surges in demand. This reflects a nuanced understanding of consumer needs and a commitment to providing a diverse range of products.\\nTechnological Prowess\\nTechnological advancements played a pivotal role in enhancing user experiences across platforms. Features like voice assistance in multiple dialects, AI/ML tools, and data science capabilities were leveraged to make the e-commerce journey seamless. Virtual try-ons, personalized interfaces, and app makeovers were among the strategies to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.\\nSustainable Growth and Focus on Value\\nThe overarching theme across the industry has been a shift towards sustainable growth and a focus on providing value. Snapdeal's emphasis on a curated selection of value products below Rs 1,000 aligns with the industry's recognition that the future of e-commerce revolves around the 'value' segment.\\nREAD MORE: Customer Experience Needs to Be Disrupted With the Power of AI in E-Commerce\\nLooking Ahead: Sustaining Growth, Innovation, and Customer-Centricity\\nAs we gaze into the future, the e-commerce industry is poised for sustained growth, continued innovation, and a steadfast commitment to customer-centric practices.

The echoes of 2023 reverberate with a promise – a promise of an industry continually redefining itself to meet the diverse needs of a dynamic and ever-growing consumer base.\\n  e-commerceDigital channelOnline Shopping\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nCustomer Experience Needs to Be Disrupted With the Power of AI in E-Commerce\\nBY - Guest author\\nDec 16, 2023 / 8 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The Indian e-commerce industry has been growing by leaps and bounds and is expected to surpass the US by 2034 to become the world’s second-largest. In 2022, Indian shoppers spent over 8.7 billion hours on shopping apps, which is almost 50 percent higher than the numbers in 2019. More and more people are now choosing to shop online, demanding seamless, personalized interactions at every touchpoint. This makes it imperative for e-commerce businesses to embrace innovation and introduce exceptional functionalities that ensure remarkable customer experiences. This would further enable them to gain a competitive edge and capture a larger share of the market.\\nOne such powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize customer experience in the realm of e-commerce is Artificial Intelligence (AI). With its strong data analyzing and predictive capabilities, AI is already making multiple breakthroughs in various aspects of e-commerce operations. Platforms powered by AI can speedily scan and analyze volumes of customer data from various channels to gauge interesting insights about consumer behavior, preferences, shopping patterns, etc. E-commerce businesses can better understand their consumers and use this knowledge to create personalized deals, recommendations, pricing, promotions, and rewards for each buyer. These tailored strategies ultimately increase the chances of successful purchases.\\nAI chatbots and voice assistants have also evolved significantly and can now drive deep personalized communications with consumers through customized content. In addition to elevating customer experiences, this personalized approach also contributes to improved sales and stronger customer loyalty. When customers feel understood and catered to, they are more likely to make a comeback for future purchases. Interestingly, 89 percent of customers expect e-commerce companies to understand their unique expectations, while a notable 64 percent lose trust in businesses that fail to deliver targeted communication.\\nAI has also been making great strides in simplifying product search on e-commerce platforms. With the sheer number of products available on any e-commerce platform, finding the right product at times becomes overwhelming for customers. This complexity often prompts shoppers to abandon their carts and leave without making an actual purchase. In India, the average cart abandonment rate is 51 percent. However, with the integration of AI in e-commerce, the search process has been greatly simplified. AI-powered insights enable e-commerce players and aggregators to provide relevant filters and sorting options, which makes it easier for shoppers to quickly find what they need. Moreover, voice search mechanisms that are quick to understand human speech, are playing a key role in changing the dynamics of product search on online shopping platforms.\\nAdditionally, e-commerce companies deal with complex logistics challenges to ensure timely delivery of products to consumers. This happens at the back end and involves massive coordination between various suppliers, warehouses, and shipping partners. AI-driven inventory management has proved to be extremely advantageous in this case. By analyzing historical data and current market conditions, the use of AI allows e-commerce businesses to accurately predict product demand. This knowledge further allows them to optimize their stock levels and mitigate the risks of stock surplus or shortages. The use of AI robots have proved effective in enhancing warehouse efficiency by streamlining order processing and reducing human error. Additionally, AI can efficiently predict lead times, transportation delays, and other supply chain disruptions, which makes it easier for businesses to make proactive adjustments. By automating repetitive tasks and providing real-time insights on the best shipping routes, AI can help businesses deliver products faster, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.\\nLooking at the current trend, 51 percent of e-commerce businesses have already integrated AI into their operations to create highly distinct customer experiences. The trend is swiftly becoming more widespread, with AI knocking on the doors of many more players. Gazing into the future, as the technology continues to evolve and penetrate deeper into the e-commerce ecosystem, more possibilities for enhancing customer experience are likely to emerge in this space.\\nBusinesses that can harness the disruptive power of AI will secure a long-term advantage in attracting and retaining customers. For others, the battle could prove to be tough, since, in today’s hyper-competitive era, it is always the survival of the fittest.\\n  About the Author\\nAnuj Bhatia, Founder, eTrade\\nWith a passion for innovation and a keen eye for market trends, Anuj founded eTrade in 2010, aiming to revolutionize the way people engage with online commerce.

Annual sale events are crucial to the industry, and in 2022 alone, India’s e-commerce industry reached Rs 40,000 crore ($480 million) in revenue. In a few days from now, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will be here. 12.7 percent of annual shopping will take place across this eight-day shopping marathon, making it one of the largest drivers of revenue for the Indian retail market.\\nWhen large, revenue-driving sales are underway, businesses face challenges with maintaining the uptime of their websites and mobile apps due to an increase in traffic. Because downtime drives customers away, competitors with more reliable systems will come out on top. When website and mobile app traffic volumes rise during sale days, backend teams need to constantly fight issues, which they may not be able to address fast enough. This is perhaps why research into Cyber Monday sales revealed that only 36 percent of customers in India were satisfied with their online experience during this sale period.\\nToday’s retailers face fierce competition amid a risky macroeconomic climate, with major hikes in energy costs, growing inflation, interest rates and supply chain disruptions causing consumers to tighten their purse strings. This makes festive sales even more critical, as customers look to find a bargain.\\nWith millions of dollars on the line, it is critical for retailers to double down on their digital customer experience (DCX) strategies to create seamless customer journeys. Observability is important here, as it allows teams to proactively analyze and optimize their systems based on logs, metrics and traces, in order to provide a real-time view of collated data. Retailers need powerful AI-driven observability solutions to ensure they can offer seamless customer experiences for festive season shoppers.\\nThe Cost of Doing Business without Observability\\nWith the festive season sales already well underway, Indian e-commerce and retail businesses must ensure that their services can scale efficiently to meet the demand of peak traffic periods, as even a small outage can have an adverse impact.\\nAccording to the New Relic State of Observability in Retail report, nearly 4 in 10 global retailers report having high-impact outages once a week. What’s concerning is the time taken to resolve these, as the longer a resolution takes, the more revenue is lost. Currently, 61 percent of retailers say it takes at least 30 minutes to resolve such outages, and this is costing them dearly. The median annual cost of IT outages among retailers stands at $9.95 million. During a sale, this could mean more revenue is lost. For businesses that aren’t using full-stack observability, the process of finding and fixing issues becomes very difficult and ultimately ends up costing the business new customers and brand loyalty.\\nFixing Incidents Quickly to Maintain Uptime\\nRetailers are realizing the benefits of observability because the payoff is evident. By adopting observability, retailers improved the time taken to detect and fix incidents. Many of them are realising the monetary benefits of maintaining uptime. The State of Observability in Retail report also revealed that nearly 60 percent of retailers derived more than $500,000 in total annual value, with 43 percent saying they derived a total annual value of $1 million or more after adopting observability.\\nIn most retail and e-commerce companies, the responsibility for maintaining uptime falls on engineering teams. To enable an omnichannel approach, retailers often depend on third-party solutions that they have little or no access to like kiosks, video cameras and POS systems. They also use different technologies for payments and external distribution logistics. With such a variety of technology in play, teams often find it challenging to easily implement telemetry in their retail strategy. And when outages occur, engineering teams at the backend have to spend hours trying to parse logs, analyse metrics and toggle between different monitoring tools. Spending a significant amount of time on fixing a single issue can pose a challenge to maintaining uptime.\\nAll-in-one observability platforms consolidate the entire process of monitoring and analyzing the IT infrastructure. It helps engineering teams find out what’s going wrong and also to derive valuable context of how it went wrong and what’s needed to fix the problem. When these processes are automated, DevOps teams can fix issues faster, ensuring uptime.\\nRetailers aiming to keep their digital storefronts operational this festive season must invest in full-stack observability. This will provide them with comprehensive visibility into their software, and the ability to proactively collect and visualise data, apply intelligence and understand the behaviour of the IT ecosystems. Observability solutions have emerged as a competitive differentiator for retailers and ecommerce companies, and the time for these businesses to adopt them is now.

Retailers have leveraged technology innovations to enhance efficiency while remaining steadfast in their commitment to customer centricity. The result? Total experiences that delight both customers and employees.\\nHowever, the retail journey doesn't stop here. The evolution of customer behavior and technology continues unabated. Retailers are mandated to stay attuned to this evolution to stay ahead of the curve in terms of sales and customer satisfaction.\\nThe future of retail is poised to ride the technology wave, further bridging the physical and digital realms. Retailers are looking beyond mere product sales on shelves, aspiring to build comprehensive ecosystems that encompass services spanning health, finance, entertainment, and more capitalizing on digitization and technology's ability to offer enhanced accessibility to consumers. In this era of technological transformation, barriers between industries are blurring, enabling retailers and other operators to seize opportunities rapidly by engaging directly with consumers.\\nSome of the technologies that are scripting this transformation and will continue to do so in the future are Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and others. These multifaceted technologies promise to revolutionize both physical and virtual operations and reshape customer relations. Let’s take a closer look at these modern-day technologies that will undoubtedly shape the future of retail, catering to a digital-first, digital-only consumer base.\\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence will Drive Customer Benevolence\\nThe ability of Generative AI to work with Large Language Models applying in-context learning to learn from analogy and generate responses based on enhanced understanding of context, improved reasoning, inference skills, and tailored problem-solving capabilities has come out as a potent force for businesses.\\nGenerative AI is a powerful technology that leverages vast datasets to create personalized experiences and optimize various aspects of retail operations. It's not limited to one area but offers multiple benefits across different functions. In content creation and optimization, Gen AI autonomously generates and improves product descriptions and copy, reducing the need for extensive human involvement. It also excels at providing personalized discounts by analyzing purchase history.\\nGen AI extends its capabilities to customer interactions through the development of intelligent bots. These bots go beyond traditional AI bots by generating relevant responses in various formats, such as text and visuals, based on real-time data. They are efficient in handling customer inquiries and can identify upselling and cross-selling opportunities.\\nIn the context of inventory management, Gen AI analyzes multiple data sources, including consumer sentiment and competitor data, to predict demand accurately. This helps retailers drive sustainability by optimizing supply and delivery, preventing inventory deficits, and avoiding wastage.\\nIn the instance of supply chain management, Gen AI can assist with product configuration in transport, ensuring the best possible use of space and safe handling of goods, apart from suggesting the most viable transport routes. This ability to optimize the operational aspect of logistics not just saves costs but also augurs well for sustainability reducing carbon footprints, and ensuring minimum wastage of perishable and high-value goods.\\nGen AI's real-time capabilities also extend to pricing optimization, where it can adjust prices based on competitor pricing, demand trends, and market conditions.\\nGen AI can also play a crucial role in fraud detection by identifying counterfeit products, unauthorized sellers, and fraudulent activities, helping retailers save valuable resources and drive sustainability. Similarly, the technology can be utilized for product and packaging design optimization, reducing material use, and encouraging recyclable materials.\\nThe versatility of the technology is already a talking point among retailers around the globe with 92% planning to ramp up their investments in Generative AI as per a GlobalNewswire release.\\nImmersive Reality will No Longer be a Novelty\\nRetailers bet big on experience as a major differentiator and try using technology to drive experience as a differentiator. The evolution of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality has thrown open a new paradigm in experience that seamlessly marries the physical with the virtual. The ability to experience furniture, fashion, and more from the comfort of the drawing room is a relatively new experience, one that customers are eagerly absorbing and consuming. According to a survey by PWC, India, China, and Qatar are most keen on VR. The survey states that 32% of users buy products after checking them out on VR platforms. A similar report on AR from NielsenIQ highlights that 56% of customers feel more confident about the product using AR, while 61% said they prefer to shop with retailers offering AR experiences.\\nAR/VR and MR empower retailers to:\\nEntertain – Walmart collaborated with DC Comics and Marvel to bring superhero-themed AR experiences to selected outlets\\nEducate – Vanity Planet’s skin reporter app scans users faces to educate them about their skin types and possible skin conditions, aligning it with complementing makeup recommendations\\nEvaluate product fit – IKEA uses AR to help users gauge the fit of furniture within a given surrounding enabling consumers to validate their purchase against their exact requirements\\nEnhance the post-purchase experience – McDonald's used AR to help users discover the origins of ingredients used in their products to ensure customers know the source of their produce and enjoy consuming the products without hesitation\\nThe evolving wave of spatial computing that utilizes a range of technologies, including AI, ML, AR, and IoT, to establish an awareness of the three-dimensional (3D) environment surrounding an object, enable it to interact seamlessly with its surroundings is a fast-developing technology poised to take the experience quotient to another level and promise an immersive, engaging future for retail consumers and better returns for retailers. The growing influence of immersive technologies is charting the way for retailers into the evolutionary world of the Metaverse. Retail giants like Nike, Gucci, and Adidas among others have already made a foray into the virtual world by buying real estate, building digital stores, conducting fashion shows, and hosting concerts. The future state of this space holds a lot of promise for retailers as it is expected to create a digital connection between the customer and the brand, like never before. Retail brands are excited about the opportunity as it provides them with direct access to zero-party data of customers, enabling retailers and service providers to establish a hyper-personalized connection with the customers. The customer is enthusiastic and buoyed by the surreal experience that is being rendered across these new digital platforms, which promises to better all previous experiences from the past.\\nExpanding the Expanse with Omnichannel Integration\\nPowering the futuristic omnichannel retail ecosystem at the front end will be a headless commerce architecture that delivers a distinctive, consistent customer experience across channels and supports all touchpoints with shared functionalities, such as wish lists, appointment booking, and payments. This architecture is also expected to be more scalable and flexible than a traditional monolithic architecture as it is decoupled from the backend giving retailers the ability to drive changes faster. The world is steadfastly embracing IoT in the shape of wearables, home automation, and more. The headless architecture will help retailers deliver content across each device type without reinventing the wheel, keeping the experience consistent. Talking of the backend, the move towards a microservices-based architecture at the backend can also be a game changer for retailers. This decoupling of the monolithic architecture at the backend will help retailers to upgrade or revamp a specific function quickly, for example integrating biometrics into the sign-in function or integrating gesture recognition for payment. These new-age capabilities can be separately developed and deployed in a modular fashion. This is unlike how it is done in the traditional monolithic architecture where the complete system would need a revamp for the addition of any functionality.\\nBlockchain Safeguarding Digital Assets Across the Virtual Terrain\\nBlockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that provides robust security and transparency for safeguarding digital assets in the retail sector across the digital landscape. Through its immutable and distributed nature, blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and data, reducing fraud and enhancing trust. For example, in supply chain management, blockchain can trace the origin and journey of products, allowing customers to verify the authenticity and quality of goods. It also acts as a powerful tool for driving sustainability within the retail sector by providing retailers insight into their supply chains, promoting responsible sourcing and reducing waste. By verifying product authenticity, blockchain helps combat counterfeiting, ensuring that consumers receive genuine, quality products discouraging the production of environmentally damaging fakes.\\nIn e-commerce, blockchain-based payment systems like Bitcoin offer secure and borderless transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Blockchain can also be a game changer in driving loyalty programs enabling retailers to offer customers rewards securely, while smart contracts, an agreement based on blockchain technology that kicks in automatically once certain conditions are met, can enforce credible, transparent agreements on product authenticity, warranties, or refund policies, ensuring a seamless and trust-driven retail experience. Blockchain holds significant value in a rapidly digitizing world that is embracing Non-Fungible Tokens, or unique digital identifiers recorded on a blockchain ledger as an identification of ownership and authenticity for digital assets such as art, music, fashion, or any other collectible owned by an entity. One of the main advantages of NFTs is that they allow people to own and intellectual property. NFT cannot be replicated, a strong reason why fashion labels, and multinational retail conglomerates, are exploring the use of NFTs to secure ownership of digital assets and thwart counterfeiting.\\nEmbracing the Future of Retail Technology, Today\\nAs inflation and fears of an economic slowdown weigh heavy on the minds of consumers, curtailing their spending, retailers will need to embrace the advances in technology to attract, convince, and drive sales to build an all-encompassing retail ecosystem. Retailers will need to deploy new-age strategies powered by contemporary technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, augmented and virtual reality, and more to get up close and personal with their customers building long-lasting trust and value. Retailers will have to look at technology not just for delivering convenience and experience but also as a medium to drive sustainability and security. The time is ripe for retailers to embrace the future of technology to catapult from digital transformation to digital ascendance.\\n    Author: Nareshraj Gururaj, Sr. Vice President, India Delivery & Operations, Innover\\n  future\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nPhygital Retail: Bridging the Gap Between Online and Offline Shopping in India\\nBY - Guest author\\nNov 06, 2023 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  \\\"Phygital\\\" describes the seamless integration of physical and digital experiences, revolutionizing the way consumers shop.

Similar to the developed countries, India is accessible to technological progress. Technology and logistics are two of the many sectors that are connected. Wherever technology is extensively used. Due to modern business methods and innovations, the flow of commodities from manufacturers, merchants, or wholesalers to customers has changed. The transition from manual to automated technologies and communication, as well as advancements in information technology, have had a significant impact on the logistics business.\\nAs a result, it is now crucial to keep track of the supply chain and the transparency of logistical activity in order to maintain the needed pace, ensure customer happiness, and guard against any delivery ecosystem inefficiencies.\\nBelow are some prominent ways that the Indian logistics sector has been transformed by technological advancements:\\nImproved Supply Chain Management\\nDue to AI's crucial position in supply chain management, technology has undergone tremendous change. One example is the development of predictive optimization, which is anticipated to become one of the biggest forces in the logistics sector. The entire supply chain is strengthened and improved through supply chain visibility solutions, which provide constant data access to all users. Predictive optimization facilitates efficient last-mile delivery by bridging the supply and demand gap through accurate forecasts. The last-mile delivery intelligence, which includes route optimization and ETA prediction, will also ensure smooth operations.\\nDigitization Ends Warehousing Problems\\nOne of the most important advantages of digital warehousing is increased visibility. Real-time understanding of inventory levels and shipment status is hampered by slow, error-prone manual methods, which cause delays and mistakes. Similar to how this data may be organized, warehouse management systems (WMS) may provide staff with real-time positional information. This level of sight helps warehouses avoid several common accidents. Improved visibility makes warehouses more useful. This augmentation might be most obvious in preference. Employees who are knowledgeable about the precise position of every item spend less time rummaging through and perusing shelves.\\nEnhanced Routing Assistance\\nAnother important impact of technical developments on the logistics industry is the enhancement of routing. Modern GPS technology makes it unlikely that drivers would get lost or that consumers will have to wait for deliveries.\\nTechnology can also be used to optimize routes, ensuring that drivers take the fastest paths possible to their destinations. In addition to knowing this before leaving, drivers can also be notified of a better route while on the road, depending on things like traffic jams, roadwork, or other unexpected delays. Businesses benefit from this flexibility to take more economical routes because it lowers fuel costs and vehicle usage.\\nSmooth Functioning\\nThe ability to track a product's delivery from start to finish is one of the most common client expectations in logistics. Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to monitor an object's temperature and location. The position and temperature of items being moved by vehicles can also be tracked using IoT. The logistics sector is seeing substantial changes in its manufacturing processes as a result of technical improvements and the e-commerce boom.\\nThe use of data to drive operations and decision-making will rise as logistics becomes more and more digitized. A seamless exchange of information between humans and machines will result from AI data analytics. AI can ascertain how logistics movement might be optimized by analyzing data and automating procedures like capacity estimation, demand patterns, network analysis, and other similar elements.\\nThe improvement of fleet performance visibility is one of the most significant ways AI may assist in lowering logistics costs. A logistics platform powered by AI would allow for precise load-vehicle matching and onboard capacity optimization. With fewer trucks, it would be possible to transport shipments that currently demand more trucks, reducing overall vehicle overburden. A logistics company can significantly increase its cost utilization in warehousing by implementing AI-based automation in inventory management. Time is saved, and fewer human resources are required, which also lowers operational costs.\\nTech Powered Fourth-Party Logistics\\nWith a 4PL, a firm outsources all of its logistics, supply chain management, and supply chain optimization to an outside logistics service provider. All distribution chain and logistics tasks are handled by 4PL Logistics, which also keeps an eye on the operational and financial effectiveness of the supply chain. These logistic aggregators cover all aspects of a company's logistics needs as well as its strategic planning. They also collaborate with 3PLs to outsource some logistics and transportation-related tasks. Significant changes in the logistics processes are made as a result of a 4PL company's strategic, operational, and technological partnership, increasing efficiency and lowering costs. One of a 4PL's key features is that it provides total visibility, real-time information, and communication to gather, store, and manage supply chain data\\nEven if reinventing the processes is necessary, Indian logistics firms must invest in modernizing technologies to create creative and effective solutions. Robotics and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used to automate operations in warehouse and transportation management. As a result, companies will be able to use fewer human help.\\n  About the Author\\nPawan Kumar, Co-Founder of Shipease\\n    Indian Logistics Industrytechnological advancements\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nOnline Sellers Shine Through Tough Times with Festive Optimism\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nOct 25, 2023 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Despite a challenging start to the year in CY23, online sellers are gearing up for a festive season comeback.

This approach has fundamentally altered how businesses connect with their audience by eliminating intermediaries and establishing direct relationships. However, in today's digital commerce landscape, marked by intense competition and soaring consumer expectations, thriving as a D2C brand requires more than just cutting out the middleman. It necessitates a strategic blend of two forces: personalization and artificial intelligence (AI).\\nD2C, short for Direct-to-Consumer, represents a business model empowering brands to oversee every aspect from production to marketing and order fulfillment. This model has surged in popularity due to a growing appetite for unique, personalized products. In contrast to the traditional supplier-to-retailer (S2R) approach, where intermediaries like wholesalers come into play, D2C brands directly sell their products through various channels, including e-commerce websites, mobile apps, and brand-owned physical stores. Freed from shelf space constraints and intermediary pricing policies, D2C brands leverage their in-depth knowledge of their target audience to curate captivating product offerings, fueling innovation and fostering close client relationships. \\nWhen it comes to  Artificial Intelligence, which is gaining a stronger foothold in our world day by day, D2C brands are not only able to collect data about consumers but also derive meaningful insights from it. This data-driven strategy enables brands to curate product catalogs with unmatched accuracy, anticipate consumer needs, and optimize pricing strategies. These brands can improve their marketing strategies, streamline their business processes, gain greater insight into their customers, and ultimately thrive in the market by utilising the power of AI. \\nFor example, imagine an online store that knows exactly what you’re looking for. It recommends products that you didn’t even think you needed. Such is the strength of AI personalization, allowing consumers to enjoy a highly curated experience. This in turn leads to a rise in consumer loyalty as well as conversions. An advantage artificial intelligence has over the human mind is that it is able to analyze and process large amounts of data, identifying patterns that humans might miss.  AI-driven recommendation engines leverage customer browsing and buying patterns to offer tailored product suggestions and content, thereby enhancing the likelihood of customers completing a purchase.\\nDirect-to-consumer (D2C) brands are reshaping the retail landscape through a powerful arsenal of AI-driven tools, such as recommendation engines, dynamic pricing algorithms, personalized email marketing, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, machine learning, augmented reality (AR), and virtual assistants. This technological synergy enables D2C brands to deeply connect with consumers and redefine their shopping experience while transcending traditional retail norms. Beyond customer engagement, these tools optimize operations, predict market trends, manage inventory efficiently, and reduce costs and waste through machine learning.

the Auto Industry\\nBY - Guest author\\nNov 21, 2024 / 7 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The way people shop for and purchase cars has changed dramatically over the past decade.Earlier, buyers had to physically go from dealership to dealership, comparing models and negotiating prices; now, much of the process can be done online.This evolution to online car buying has revolutionised the auto industry.In the section below, we'll discuss how online car buying transforms the auto industry.The Evolution of Car Buying: Traditional vs Online\\nTraditionally, buying a car meant heading to local dealerships, test-driving various models, and haggling face-to-face over vehicle prices and financing terms.Information was limited to what individual sales associates provided, making it hard for buyers to compare different makes and models.The paperwork and financial arrangements were handled onsite before driving home your new vehicle.In contrast, online car buying allows you to research cars from desktop or mobile devices on your own time.You can browse inventory across a wide geographic area, view 360-degree interior tours and video test drives, and compare pricing and specs side-by-side.When ready to buy, you can select models you want, apply for financing, estimate payments, fill out paperwork, and even have your vehicle delivered to your doorstep.Key Benefits of Online Car Buying\\nThe benefits of buying a car from an online platform are mentioned below:\\n  1.Convenience and Time Savings\\nA major perk is the convenience of researching and buying from home or anywhere.There is no need to schedule trips across town to different dealers during work hours.Online buying saves huge amounts of time.2.Broader Selection \\nSearching dealer online inventories opens up options across a whole region rather than just one lot.This means more choices in terms of makes, model configurations, and colours.3.Transparent Pricing\\nOnline listings display pricing, allowing savvy shoppers to compare vehicle prices more easily across dealers.With traditional dealerships, buyers had to negotiate with individual salespeople to learn “bottom-level” pricing.The transparency of online prices levels the playing field.4.Easy Financing \\nGetting pre-approved financing online is simple.It lets you know your budget before entering negotiations.Online applications through dealer or third-party lending networks streamline the financing process.5.Streamlined Paperwork and Delivery\\nFinalising all paperwork digitally reduces the long, stressful process at the dealership.Online buyers can sign and submit documents electronically to complete purchases.Many dealers now offer home delivery once sales are finalised.How Online Car Buying is Changing Consumer Behavior  \\nThe convenience and transparency of online car buying is shifting how people research, evaluate and decide on purchasing vehicles:\\nOnline reviews and 360 views replace some in-person research.Pricing information and tools create buyer expectations around deals.Buyers prefer no-haggle pricing vs negotiating unfamiliar car pricing models and payments.More customers complete the buying journey digitally versus at dealerships.How to Choose the Right Online Platform for Car Buying\\nHere are some tips for choosing the right online platform for car buying:\\nLook for a user-friendly website with extensive search filters to find your desired vehicles.AckoDrive is one such online platform that one should choose for a smooth car-buying process.Check if they provide upfront pricing without negotiating with sales staff for quotes.Transparent prices must be there.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"X/Ou0U/SBfBt30d+/XRgpK47z3Ho9y8qqEeKtafVdIc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8de44147-3b0f-4054-874b-b95fa071c5a3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8de44147-3b0f-4054-874b-b95fa071c5a3\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f17f5275-1013-40b6-afb2-dd8616ebeaae\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"D5Bw76CwlWQJjXC29HINmMk0omA3iBlvarr9+B2jUGc=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"12e44285-844e-4d3e-9a20-c1634e873ba3\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"w7/Ulbfsv7pzgsaN46m5F8JdjNw/ZpdufmVHnLw5DHw=\"}},\"text\":\"Online

Businesses\\nBY - Guest author\\nNov 21, 2024 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The retail industry in India is booming with MSME startups, and it is becoming more important for such companies to have insurance policies to retain their employees in the long term.Whether you hire an office employee or a work-from-home one, giving them the right perks is essential.The average policy size for retail health insurance in India has grown by almost 48% over the past six years.Rising medical costs and growing demand for policies with broader coverage options among policyholders drive this increase.Retail health insurance provides coverage for both the individual employee and their family.In this kind of insurance, the individual directly buys the insurance through the company.Such policies are personalised to cover their medical plans.How Medical Health Insurance Attracts Employees\\nProviding medical health insurance is a great way of bonding with employees and keeping them motivated.A few advantages are:\\n●Providing a Healthy Work Culture\\nWhen employees know the perks from the initial days, their chances of having work motivation are higher, which promises a healthy work culture and helps maintain a loyal relationship with the company.The reason is that having medical health insurance is safe for them and their families.Their financial and medical needs would be handled, as health is a serious concern nowadays.●Helps Hire Top Talents\\nA recent survey reveals that Indian companies increasingly include outpatient department (OPD) and preventive healthcare costs in their group insurance plans.The survey highlights a 30-40% rise in adoption rates across healthcare, power, engineering, banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI).Also, providing perks like medical health insurance adds an advantage in the hiring process, as it is an added incentive that helps retain employees.●Flexibility In Premium Plans And Tax Savings\\nTax savings are an important part of a retail business owner's or company's strategic planning.Hence, health insurance is one of the best ways to provide an added advantage to employees and encourage them to seek its benefits.It also helps them plan and save on taxes.Retailer businesses can seek low per-employee premium plans to maintain their cashflows without the tension of investing a large amount at once.In addition, the company faces a diversity risk within its group plan.This risk is evaluated and factored into the plan, resulting in a lower overall premium cost.For instance, premium rates are typically lower when providing group health insurance.Job Satisfaction And Boosts Morale\\nNowadays, proving compensation isn't enough to ensure stability, but providing additional advantages like the following.●Employees who feel that their well-being is prioritised are likelier to develop a positive, emotional connection to their organisation.These perks often become a factor in employees' commitment, as they see that the company is dedicated to supporting their needs beyond just a paycheck.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ceFWw2ccw7BvKLYNMzA1t57fJHUz/Y1ipK0AtiVoZxU=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"12e44285-844e-4d3e-9a20-c1634e873ba3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"12e44285-844e-4d3e-9a20-c1634e873ba3\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"8de44147-3b0f-4054-874b-b95fa071c5a3\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"eIkKJOJvtidRNuCIg158W/KcmpCgFws5Ap/0Uhia9uw=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"979677fd-6633-4086-ad83-5b3b1bff48e0\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"S4vymtMGApO83qIe4t4LZ4AMNRDoC3uX0YbVk6qBq5s=\"}},\"text\":\"Hence,

invest their energy and skills in the company’s goals.●Many employees struggle to maintain a work-life balance due to demanding schedules and the “always-on” culture.Offering flexible work hours, remote work options, or mental health days gives employees the flexibility to address personal needs without feeling guilty about work.Takeaway\\nAny retail owner who wishes to expand their business must have a strong, focused team, which is possible when employees are met.This is only possible by covering their risk to ensure stress-free work.Medical health insurance policies through ACKO help provide mental stability and act as a strategic investment for retail businesses to meet their future goals.InsuranceEconomy & Policy\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nNavigating Life Insurance

multiple factors must be considered to ensure you get the best coverage for your requirements.One crucial element is the Insured Declared Value (IDV), which plays a significant role in determining your premium and maximum claim amount.In this guide, we will explore why IDV calculation matters and how you can use an IDV calculator for your bike insurance.What is the Insured Declared Value?The Insured Declared Value or IDV represents the current market value of your bike.It determines the maximum amount you can claim in the event of a total loss or theft of your bike.For instance, if your bike is stolen or has irreparable damage during an accident, the insurance company will reimburse the amount based on the IDV set on your policy.In addition, the IDV considers multiple factors, such as the bike’s age, depreciation, and the manufacturer’s listed selling price.The IDV is usually closer to the selling price for new bikes, but as your bike ages, the IDV decreases due to depreciation.Why Does Insured Declared Value Matter in Bike Insurance?\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"GIark2nKplA2Im2pTeOl/1Jv+YwJ/8BIkNcdKCu/fcg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"cd16ad34-5807-4eb0-94fd-c849bb877365":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"cd16ad34-5807-4eb0-94fd-c849bb877365\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9095ac79-8770-47cd-b55a-c18a6b10245e\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"fkS27+N/KaPNXxWQGjKAv92fqxir2RaBlkvCxKVXR08=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"42eb520a-2f23-4897-a68b-3d698fa7751e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"PKfZm9axnDusMbUA8EP9gXe6u+Zta76/y+8O91LNZdo=\"}},\"text\":\"In

Bike Insurance?Understanding the importance of IDV will help you to appreciate the significance of setting the value.Here are a few reasons why IDV calculation matters for bike insurance:\\n1.Determines Claim Amount\\nIDV sets the upper limit for claim reimbursements.It indicates that the IDV is the maximum amount you can claim during a theft or total damage.Setting a lower IDV might save you some premium costs but reduces the claim amount, potentially leaving you with insufficient coverage.2.Impacts Premium Costs\\n\\nIDV directly influences your bike insurance premium.A higher IDV means higher premiums as the insurer's liability increases.On the other hand, a lower IDV results in lower premiums but lower claim payouts.Hence, you can use a two wheeler insurance premium calculator to balance premium affordability and adequate coverage.3.Affects Depreciation\\nDepreciation is one of the biggest factors that affects your bike's IDV.In addition, every year, your bike's value decreases as it ages.The depreciation rate is pre-defined by the insurance regulators and varies depending on your bike's age.Hence, you must consider the depreciation value when calculating IDV value to get a realistic assessment.How to Use an Insured Declared Value Calculator?Here is a step-by-step guide you can follow to use an IDV calculator for your bike insurance:\\nStep 1: Visit the Insurance Company’s Website\\nOpen the website of your preferred insurance company and visit its IDV calculator webpage to use the calculator.Step 2: Input Your Bike's Details\\nThe calculator will prompt you to input details such as make, model, variant, year of manufacture and registration date.Some calculators may ask for more details, like engine capacity and fuel type.Step 3: Add Accessories\\nYou must input the details of extra fittings or modifications in your bike.The calculator will calculate their approximated value in the final IDV calculation.Step 4: Choose Depreciation\\nThe calculator will automatically calculate the correct depreciation rate based on your bike’s age.Step 5: Check the IDV\\nThe calculator will calculate the IDV, which becomes the current market value of your bike.You can use that IDV to compare different insurance companies or options.Step 6: Adjust for Your Budget\\nIf the calculated IDV is higher or lower than your budget can permit, you may modify the IDV values to understand how it will affect your premium.What is the Role of an Insured Declared Value Calculator?An IDV calculator is a valuable tool for bike owners.It simplifies the process of IDV calculation, offering quick and accurate results without the need for manual calculations.Here is how using an IDV calculator can benefit you:\\n1.Convenient and Accurate\\nAn IDV calculator saves you time by providing instant, accurate results for your bike insurance.Enter your bike’s details, and the calculator handles the rest, reducing errors.With updated depreciation rates and market values built-in, IDV calculators help you avoid under or over-insurance, ensuring your coverage is precise and reliable.2.Compare and Customise Policies\\nIDV calculators let you compare premiums across different IDV values, helping you find the perfect balance between premium cost and coverage.It also allows customisation by including added accessories.You can get a premium quote tailored to your bike’s actual value.Final Words\\nInsured Declared Value is vital for your bike insurance policy to determine the premium and maximum claim amount.Setting an accurate IDV ensures you are adequately protected without overpaying premiums.You can use an IDV calculator to streamline the calculation process and make informed decisions quickly and easily.Moreover, you secure optimal coverage for your bike, giving you peace of mind on every

IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nNov 07, 2024 / 13 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In a fast-paced world where time is increasingly a precious commodity, quick commerce is transforming how shoppers fulfill their grocery needs.From its humble beginnings as a convenience-driven service for busy urbanites, quick commerce has surged into mainstream grocery shopping.According to a recent report by NielsenIQ (NIQ), 31 percent of Indian shoppers now turn to quick commerce as their main grocery channel, with an additional 39 percent relying on it for top-up purchases.This dramatic shift toward quick commerce reflects a broader consumer movement toward speed, accessibility, and convenience, underscoring critical changes in how shoppers interact with the retail ecosystem.The Quick Commerce Revolution: Key Drivers\\nQuick commerce, characterized by its ultra-fast delivery times and focus on small-basket, high-frequency purchases, is reshaping the FMCG sector.As NIQ’s Mitesh Dabrai noted, the doubling in quick commerce usage over the past year is a clear indicator of its relevance to modern shoppers, who are increasingly “discerning, price-conscious, and channel-agnostic.”Economic pressures, coupled with a desire for instant gratification, have driven a significant portion of Indian shoppers toward quick commerce for essentials.Rising Food Prices and Demand for Convenience\\nRising inflation has forced Indian shoppers to make difficult choices regarding where and how they shop.With 87 percent of consumers feeling the impact of escalating food prices, price-conscious behavior has become more pronounced across various segments.However, while price sensitivity has affected purchasing decisions, it has not diminished the demand for convenience.Rather, shoppers are now more strategic in balancing their needs for affordability with a growing inclination for faster, more efficient shopping experiences.Quick commerce meets this dual need by offering solutions that appeal to both convenience-seekers and budget-conscious shoppers.For instance, with smaller basket sizes and frequent top-up options, shoppers can buy what they need without overextending their budgets.Categories such as Ready-to-Eat meals and Salty Snacks have shown substantial growth in the quick commerce channel, with 42 percent and 45 percent of shoppers using it to meet their cravings for convenience food.Changing Shopper Behavior: The Shift to Multichannel\\nThe NIQ report highlights a notable shift in consumer habits, with shoppers embracing multichannel shopping options.Interestingly, 20 percent of offline shoppers now also rely on online platforms for grocery needs, with metropolitan shoppers using quick commerce for their primary grocery purchases, and non-metro shoppers using it for top-ups.This shift underscores a more versatile shopper who moves seamlessly between channels based on needs, availability, and time constraints.E-commerce and quick commerce are no longer confined to secondary, fill-in purchases.Increasingly, consumers are using these platforms for monthly shopping, particularly in metropolitan regions, where delivery infrastructure supports rapid, reliable service.According to the report, staples have emerged as a prominent category within e-commerce platforms, with 60 percent of Indian shoppers using online channels for essential groceries.The Influence of Price and Promotions on Store and Brand Choice\\nAs consumers shift to quick commerce, they are also becoming savvier about promotions and discounts, which significantly influence where and how they shop.Modern Trade is a powerful draw for promotions, with 40 percent of shoppers saying they change stores based on offers, while impulse buying is led by both Modern Trade (47 percent) and Online channels (35 percent).Price sensitivity has increased across all income groups due to inflation, pushing shoppers to seek better value propositions.For FMCG brands, this trend is an opportunity to differentiate themselves through strategic pricing, bundle offers, and exclusive promotions.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"fN+oEGhiZrFPKOxNhBo/0to3rrtADZiflWliGeGWj8o=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b396ffd5-1c68-41bd-a4bc-393e2f9a6a0a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b396ffd5-1c68-41bd-a4bc-393e2f9a6a0a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"42eb520a-2f23-4897-a68b-3d698fa7751e\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"PKfZm9axnDusMbUA8EP9gXe6u+Zta76/y+8O91LNZdo=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"6352e24a-36ad-475f-8183-4603e0c8925d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"aKgWLIcxZAHpVCENndtyEFqOQpCXIXfKlNGoP8sTmJ8=\"}},\"text\":\"E-commerce

FMCG brands, this trend is an opportunity to differentiate themselves through strategic pricing, bundle offers, and exclusive promotions.By providing value-added services within the quick commerce space—such as cashback offers, discount codes, or subscription models—brands can capture loyal consumers who value both savings and efficiency.Quick Commerce as a Driver of Private Label Growth\\nPrivate labels have emerged as a growth opportunity within the quick commerce ecosystem, fueled by rising consumer interest in premium and affordable alternatives.The NIQ report found that 67 percent of shoppers are actively seeking premium private labels, particularly in categories like carbonated beverages, staples, and snacks.The popularity of private labels reflects an evolving consumer landscape, where shoppers are increasingly open to exploring non-traditional brands that offer value without compromising quality.Quick commerce platforms, with their agile supply chains and focus on convenience, are uniquely positioned to promote private label products.These platforms often feature exclusive deals on their in-house brands, further strengthening customer loyalty and increasing the likelihood of repeat purchases.For FMCG companies, investing in private label development and aligning these brands with consumer preferences can be a powerful differentiator.The Role of Quick Commerce in Sustainability and Local Preferences\\nIn an era of heightened awareness about sustainability, quick commerce also caters to a growing demand for eco-friendly and locally produced goods.As more consumers seek to align their shopping habits with their values, quick commerce has the potential to respond by promoting local and sustainable products.The NIQ report reveals that sustainability is particularly significant to Gen Z and Boomer shoppers, who increasingly prefer locally manufactured items.By providing access to locally sourced groceries and sustainable products through quick commerce, retailers can capitalize on this trend while supporting local businesses.Additionally, with shorter delivery times and optimized logistics, quick commerce minimizes the carbon footprint of last-mile delivery—a critical consideration for environmentally conscious shoppers.The Future of Grocery Shopping: Challenges and Opportunities for FMCG Brands\\nFor FMCG brands, the rise of quick commerce presents both opportunities and challenges.On one hand, quick commerce enables brands to connect with consumers at a time when convenience is king.However, it also demands constant innovation and adaptability to meet evolving shopper expectations.Shoppers today expect not only speed but also a seamless, frictionless shopping experience, regardless of the platform or channel.One critical area for FMCG brands is product assortment.In a space that relies heavily on fast-moving, high-demand items, curating the right mix of products is essential.For example, categories like Ready-to-Eat meals, snacks, and staples are well-suited for quick commerce, while less essential items may not perform as strongly.Brands must identify and prioritize items that align with quick commerce shopper behavior, ensuring they remain relevant and responsive to changing needs.Addressing the Evolving Demand for Speed and Efficiency\\nThe growing preference for quick commerce among Indian shoppers signals an opportunity for brands to rethink logistics and distribution models.By investing in technology that optimizes inventory management and improves delivery efficiency, FMCG brands can better serve this high-demand channel.Moreover, as retailers become more data-driven, they can leverage consumer insights to tailor offerings based on region, purchasing history, and seasonal demand.The Significance of Consumer Loyalty in a Competitive Landscape\\nAs more brands enter the quick commerce space, retaining consumer loyalty will become paramount.While price and promotions are significant, brands must also focus on fostering relationships with consumers through loyalty programs, personalized offers, and responsive customer service.Building brand affinity in the quick commerce segment requires ongoing engagement and innovation, ensuring that shoppers feel valued and connected to the brand.Quick Commerce as the New Normal\\nQuick commerce has undeniably reshaped the grocery shopping landscape, bringing unprecedented convenience to consumers while challenging traditional retail models.As FMCG brands navigate this evolving market, they must be agile and responsive to consumer demands for speed, value, and accessibility.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"4SvRXB/YTADEE18fFj+DRI3JpwdZJXc7+helRZaz+68=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6352e24a-36ad-475f-8183-4603e0c8925d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6352e24a-36ad-475f-8183-4603e0c8925d\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"b396ffd5-1c68-41bd-a4bc-393e2f9a6a0a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"4SQBZlR7naTy62Mt/NBVR3mCHbCw12h5TJvtAlQ0XHU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"16022a10-6029-4690-942e-cd523fcfb02e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"TVjnoWW30/JABgjF7SiGYPLeATxePTcdQKJGk56t7v8=\"}},\"text\":\"By

 The 2024 festive season sales have kicked off with a bang in the Indian e-commerce industry, delivering a significant increase in both order volumes and gross merchandise value (GMV).According to data from Unicommerce, the initial four days of the sale (September 26-29) saw a 20 percent rise in order volumes compared to the same period last year.GMV witnessed an even more impressive 24 percent growth, highlighting a robust start to what promises to be a highly lucrative shopping season.Key Growth Areas\\nUnicommerce analyzed over 1.3 million orders processed through its platform, revealing that fashion and accessories experienced a 32 percent growth during the first few days of the sale.Categories like travel accessories, watches, and kids' apparel saw the most substantial demand within the fashion segment.Interestingly, makeup products recorded an outstanding 54 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth.This is indicative of a growing trend where personal care and beauty items are becoming more central to festive season shopping in India.Kapil Makhija, Managing Director and CEO of Unicommerce, attributes this surge to increasing consumer interest in self-grooming and beauty products during the festive period.He noted, “Festive season sale has become an exciting phase of the year when everyone awaits the attractive offers and the extensive variety of products.While this continues as a trend year after year, we see an increasing number of brands participating in the sale season, affirming India's status as a digitally forward country.”The health and pharma category was another star performer, registering a 33 percent rise in order volumes.Nutraceuticals and fitness supplements were the standout products, reflecting a growing focus on health and wellness among Indian consumers.Home Décor's Surge in High-Value Purchases\\nWhile home décor saw only a slight increase in order volumes, the category reported an impressive 50 percent rise in GMV.This suggests that consumers are willing to spend more on high-ticket items, reflecting an overall improvement in purchasing power.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"h8maL3PlwkzAizXDG4tLMn7UYw0V7RHI/mbNlwBovTY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ebd4347f-6c48-457f-879a-044c93bd310e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ebd4347f-6c48-457f-879a-044c93bd310e\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"16022a10-6029-4690-942e-cd523fcfb02e\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"TVjnoWW30/JABgjF7SiGYPLeATxePTcdQKJGk56t7v8=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b3763fbd-0321-4ec7-8811-b27275e9b8ed\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"xJyjMLdvh/WLIk/thwvm8IQkG0CMkThvc9BSqYy4gNE=\"}},\"text\":\"He

quality products that elevate living spaces.Phone accessories, books, sports equipment, and healthy snacks also experienced increased demand during the early sale period, proving that consumers are diversifying their purchases across various categories.Riding High on The Big Billion Days Success\\nFlipkart, India’s largest e-commerce marketplace, also reported significant growth during the early days of its flagship event, The Big Billion Days (TBBD).The 2024 edition of TBBD, which began on September 27, attracted over 33 crore user visits during the Early Access phase and Day 1 combined.This reflects a strong festive enthusiasm from consumers across India.Harsh Chaudhary, Vice President of Growth at Flipkart, shared insights into the platform’s success, stating, \\\"Every year, the festive season in India kicks off with The Big Billion Days, which brings an entire ecosystem together to celebrate.This event is more than just a shopping festival; it is an opportunity that fosters growth, innovation, and collaboration at a national scale, while positively impacting the lives of diverse communities.\\\"Chaudhary highlighted that early trends showed an increase in demand for categories such as mobile phones, food and nutrition, and grooming products.\\\"At Flipkart, we believe in continuously raising the bar for what is possible in the digital economy while empowering everyone in this journey,\\\" he added.Moreover, Flipkart observed growing demand from Tier II and Tier III cities, further cementing the platform's role in democratizing access to e-commerce across India.The company's ability to cater to a wide range of consumer needs, from lifestyle upgrades to everyday essentials, has positioned it as a leader in the festive sales season.100 percent Increase in Day 1 Orders\\nWhile Flipkart celebrates its continued success, Meesho, India's only true e-commerce marketplace, has been making headlines with its stunning performance during the 2024 festive season.Meesho’s ‘Mega Blockbuster Sale,’ which began on September 27, recorded a 100 percent increase in Day 1 orders compared to last year.Additionally, the platform tripled its daily order volume, further establishing itself as a formidable player in the e-commerce space.Megha Agarwal, General Manager of Business at Meesho, was elated with the results, stating, \\\"We’re thrilled by the overwhelming response to day one of our Mega Blockbuster Sale.A heartfelt thank you to our valued sellers, brand partners, and loyal customers for this fantastic beginning.\\\"The platform witnessed a record-breaking ~1.5 crore app downloads in the lead-up to the sale, making it the most downloaded app on Google Play Store.Nearly 6.5 crore customers shopped on Meesho during Day 1, with fashion, personal care, home & kitchen, and electronic accessories being the most popular categories.On average, 506 kurtis, 376 sarees, and 360 kids' wear items were sold every minute, reflecting a staggering

contributors to festive season sales.These regions, often underserved by traditional retail, are experiencing a digital transformation, thanks to the expansion of internet access and e-commerce

a convenient shopping environment.As more people lead a rather hectic lifestyle, fast commerce is changing the way we consume products by delivering them within minutes.Also Read: How Quick Commerce

Consumer Buying Behaviour in Fashion\\nBY - Guest author\\nSep 22, 2024 / 7 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Fast delivery is changing the shopping experience all together.It is no longer just a perk—it is a must-have—something customers expect.With e-commerce booming, global sales are predicted to hit $7.4 trillion by 2025, according to eMarketer.Fashion retailers are feeling the pressure, and keeping up with fast delivery is quickly becoming one of their biggest challenges.Take India, for example.The fashion e-commerce market there was worth $14 billion in 2023, and it is set to grow to nearly $19 billion by 2030.It is growing at a rate of 34 percent every year, fueled by more people getting online, more smartphone use, and higher disposable incomes.But with this growth, shoppers expect more than just great products—they want them delivered fast.Many retailers, especially those with storefronts, are struggling to meet this expectation.That is where new-age marketplaces are stepping in and shaking things up, making it easier for brands to offer ultra-fast delivery without having to build out their own logistics systems.These platforms are not just meeting the demand for speed—they are changing how we think about the entire shopping experience.Nowadays, people want their fashion items delivered almost instantly.A global survey by Localz found that 77 percent of shoppers expect their order within two hours or less.In India, it is even more intense—80 percent of shoppers are looking for same-day delivery, and more than half of them expect to get their order in just a few hours (Invespcro, 2023).This shift in expectations is pushing brands to find ways to offer faster service, and partnering with these fast-delivery marketplaces is the easiest way to do it.The exciting part?The market for these platforms is still pretty fresh, so brands that get in now have a huge opportunity for a first-mover advantage.According to Market Data Forecast, the same-day delivery market in India alone is expected to reach over $10 billion by 2028.That is a massive chance for brands to solve the fast delivery challenge early on and stand out in a rapidly growing market.Partnering with these new-age platforms is a game changer.Instead of worrying about how to offer ultra-fast delivery on their own, brands and storefronts can team up with these platforms, who already have the logistics and technology in place.It’s a win-win—brands get to offer quick delivery, and customers get the convenience they crave without the usual hassles.After all, 53 percent of shoppers have admitted to canceling a purchase just because the delivery was too slow (MarketingProfs, 2023).That is a lot of potential sales lost, all because delivery didn’t meet expectations.What makes these marketplaces stand out is how they combine fast delivery with a smooth shopping experience.It is not just about getting the product quickly—they offer things like real-time tracking, easy returns, and even personalized recommendations.It turns what could be a frustrating waiting game into an experience that keeps customers engaged and happy.Imagine ordering your favorite outfit and having it at your door in under an hour—there is no doubt it is changing the way people shop.For fashion brands and retailers, the key here is that they do not have to tackle this delivery issue on their own.By teaming up with these platforms, they can offer fast service to their customers, without all the costs and headaches of building their own shipping systems.That is especially important now that consumers expect things like free shipping (with 66 percent of them considering it standard, according to Inc, 2023) and ultra-fast service.This is a big chance for brands to upgrade their game and provide something customers genuinely want.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"UhEFUZNjpJTvEk7gD8CZEYuafD3AAwChVF7pzkv+tgw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"577b1585-662c-4f94-88ca-9ebc216503d6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"577b1585-662c-4f94-88ca-9ebc216503d6\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9c899bfd-9f44-4f87-932c-9fd3c30c41aa\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"zr280cmaf9YEZgUNfqABLqEJq0+sp2yRKJd6LBJ2oq8=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"8e30ca8c-26e5-40e0-b36b-2f5df40dcc26\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"QxTpnWEslH7Sa+u1qvdYCuPxsvRafJB0/WqA5sMHMRY=\"}},\"text\":\"What

Issues\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nSep 17, 2024 / 9 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  India’s food industry has witnessed a remarkable transformation in recent years, with the packaged food market growing at an unprecedented rate.According to EuroMonitor, India is now the third-largest packaged food market in the world.In tandem with this growth, the e-commerce grocery segment has also surged, with monthly revenue surpassing Rs 6,800 crore in July 2024, marking a 12.1 percent rise from June 2024, as per ECDB.This remarkable growth is driven by the increased demand for convenience and accessibility, with more consumers turning to online platforms for their grocery needs.However, a recent study conducted by Natfirst has uncovered significant compliance issues within this fast-growing sector.The analysis, which examined 2,871 grocery products listed on a major Indian e-commerce platform, found that 34.83 percent of products (approximately 1,000) had incomplete or inaccurate labelling information, posing challenges for consumers in making well-informed food choices.The study revealed several critical discrepancies in the labelling of pre-packaged food products.These issues ranged from inconsistent or missing net weights to illegible barcodes and poor-quality product images.Notably, 65 products lacked multiple essential labelling elements, including the nutritional table, ingredients list, and net weight.Furthermore, 232 products featured images that were unclear or illegible, while 139 products did not provide a nutritional table at all.Such lapses in labelling are a cause for concern, particularly in a country like India, where food safety and consumer rights are of paramount importance.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has long mandated strict labelling and display regulations for pre-packaged foods under the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations.These regulations are designed to provide consumers with accurate and clear information, allowing them to make informed decisions about the food they consume.However, there is still a significant gap in compliance.The Importance of Accurate Food Labelling\\nFood labelling is not just about adhering to regulatory norms—it plays a critical role in ensuring consumer safety and trust.Accurate and comprehensive labelling provides essential information on nutritional values, ingredients, allergens, and other critical details that help consumers make informed dietary choices.Inaccurate or incomplete labels can lead to confusion, potentially putting consumers at risk, especially those with specific dietary requirements or allergies.Moreover, with the growing popularity of health-conscious eating, many consumers rely on nutritional labels to guide their food choices.A lack of clarity or missing information could hinder their ability to make healthier choices, undermining efforts to promote public health.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"+rM8637BTG0RspRGJvoESjpvzbUMYG7l0fcA0vSM0dE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8e30ca8c-26e5-40e0-b36b-2f5df40dcc26":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8e30ca8c-26e5-40e0-b36b-2f5df40dcc26\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"577b1585-662c-4f94-88ca-9ebc216503d6\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"KXvtLtUMuIc3GkzM7cTrfSS8kkLqjHBKzMpD9vRr9XQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c9048d00-5fd9-497d-af33-569a72885b90\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"k61hBf4rrOVHslJScZvBKdJE0X82unsYPBRl0HT9lnw=\"}},\"text\":\"These

health-conscious eating, many consumers rely on nutritional labels to guide their food choices.A lack of clarity or missing information could hinder their ability to make healthier choices, undermining efforts to promote public health.FSSAI Reactivates Draft Amendment Regulations\\nIn response to the findings of the Natfirst study and the increasing pressure to ensure compliance, the FSSAI has recently reactivated the draft Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Amendment Regulations, 2022.These amendments aim to strengthen the labelling norms for pre-packaged food products sold through e-commerce platforms.Under these revised regulations, e-commerce companies will be required to provide a clear image of the principal display panel of pre-packed foods on their platforms.This panel should prominently feature essential details, such as the product’s net weight, ingredients, and nutritional information.Additionally, all food products listed on e-commerce sites must display the manufacturer’s FSSAI License or Registration number, ensuring that consumers can verify the product's compliance with food safety standards.The regulations also permit the sampling of food products at any point in the supply chain to ensure adherence to labelling norms.This provision will help maintain the integrity of food products throughout their journey from manufacturer to consumer, reinforcing consumer confidence in the safety and quality of the food they purchase online.The Need for Retail Intelligence Solutions\\nThe findings of the Natfirst study underscore the urgent need for retail intelligence solutions to ensure real-time compliance with FSSAI norms.As Ravi Putrevu, Founder of Natfirst and TruthIn, emphasized, “Maintaining high-quality food labelling standards is an ongoing challenge, especially with millions of products being sold each month across diverse sales platforms.Regulatory compliance must be ensured not only in the domestic market but also in international markets where Indian food products are exported.”Retail intelligence solutions can help bridge the gap between regulatory requirements and actual compliance by automating the process of monitoring and verifying product labelling.These solutions can provide real-time insights into product listings, flagging any discrepancies or missing information and helping e-commerce platforms and manufacturers correct these issues promptly.Additionally, these tools can assist in maintaining consistent product quality and transparency, which are vital for ensuring consumer trust in both domestic and international markets.With the global demand for Indian packaged food products on the rise, particularly in markets such as the US, UK, and Middle East, ensuring adherence to international food safety standards is crucial.READ MORE: What’s Fueling the Grocery Industry in 2024\\nThe Role of E-Commerce Platforms\\nE-commerce platforms play a pivotal role in facilitating consumer access to a wide range of food products.However, they also bear a significant responsibility in ensuring that the products listed on their platforms comply with regulatory norms.As online grocery shopping continues to grow in popularity, platforms must prioritize product accuracy and transparency.By enforcing stricter standards for product listings and working closely with manufacturers and regulatory authorities, e-commerce platforms can help ensure that consumers receive accurate and reliable information about the food products they purchase.This will not only enhance consumer safety but also promote trust in the growing online grocery sector.Grocerye-commerce\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nE-commerce and Jewelry: Navigating the Online Retail

2023, global e-commerce sales in the jewelry market reached approximately $250 billion, a figure expected to grow by 8 percent annually.The convenience and accessibility of online shopping have made it possible for consumers to purchase exquisite pieces from the comfort of their homes.For brands today, navigating this online retail landscape presents both opportunities and challenges.This article explores how e-commerce is reshaping the jewelry market and offers insights into successfully managing an online jewelry business.The Rise of Online Jewelry Shopping\\nChanging Consumer Behavior\\nIn recent years, consumer behavior has shifted significantly towards online shopping, with 85 percent of shoppers in the U.S.alone purchasing products online in 2023.The pandemic further accelerated this trend, driving a 25 percent increase in online jewelry sales globally.Jewelry, once thought to be an item that needed to be seen and felt in person, has found its place in the e-commerce world.Consumers now value the convenience, variety, and often competitive pricing available online, with 62 percent of millennials preferring to shop for jewelry online rather than in physical stores.Trust and Authenticity\\nOne of the major challenges in selling jewelry online is establishing trust and authenticity.According to a survey, 70 percent of online jewelry shoppers cite trust as their primary concern.To address this, brands have adopted strategies such as providing detailed product descriptions, high-resolution images, and certificates of authenticity.Additionally, jewelry brands with a strong legacy, such as those with over 20 years in the market, are leveraging their experience to build credibility, resulting in a 15 percent higher customer retention rate compared to newer brands.Building a Strong Online Presence\\nUser-Friendly Website\\nA user-friendly website is crucial for any e-commerce business.Statistics show that 88 percent of online consumers are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience.For a jewelry brand, the website should feature an intuitive design, easy navigation, and a seamless checkout process.High-quality images and videos, along with comprehensive product details, help customers make informed decisions.Brands that invest in high-quality visuals experience a 25 percent increase in conversion rates compared to those with basic imagery.Engaging Content\\nEngaging content is vital to attract and retain customers.Data reveals that content marketing can generate three times more leads than traditional outbound marketing, at 62 percent less cost.Jewelry brands are increasingly focusing on creating blog posts, social media updates, and email newsletters to showcase new collections, share styling tips, and highlight the brand’s story.This personalized approach to content has been shown to increase customer engagement by 18 percent.Customer Reviews and Testimonials\\nCustomer reviews and testimonials play a significant role in building trust, with 92 percent of consumers reading online reviews before making a purchase.Encouraging satisfied customers to share their experiences and prominently displaying these reviews on the website can significantly boost conversion rates.In fact, products with over 50 reviews are 4.6 times more likely to be purchased than those without reviews.Leveraging Technology\\nVirtual Try-Ons\\nInnovative technologies like virtual try-ons are enhancing the online jewelry shopping experience.A study found that 78 percent of shoppers prefer to use virtual try-on tools before making a purchase, and brands offering this feature have seen a 15 percent increase in sales.This technology bridges the gap between online shopping and the in-store experience, allowing customers to visualize how a piece will look on them, which reduces the likelihood of returns by 35 percent.Augmented Reality (AR)\\nAugmented reality (AR) is another technology that is revolutionizing the online jewelry market.By 2026, the AR market is expected to be worth over $97.76 billion, with the jewelry sector being a significant contributor.AR apps allow customers to view jewelry pieces in 3D and from different angles using their smartphones.This interactive experience has been shown to increase customer engagement by 20 percent and boost purchase intentions by 33 percent.Providing Exceptional Customer Service\\nPersonalized Consultations\\nEven in the digital age, personalized customer service remains crucial.Offering virtual consultations through video calls allows customers to receive expert advice from the comfort of their homes.Studies indicate that 56 percent of online shoppers are more likely to return to a site that offers personalized services.By providing 1:1 consultations, brands can better understand clients’ preferences and recommend pieces that suit their individual styles, leading to a 10 percent increase in customer satisfaction.Hassle-Free Returns\\nA flexible and hassle-free return policy is essential to build trust and ensure customer satisfaction.According to a report, 67 percent of shoppers check the return policy before making a purchase, and 92 percent will buy again if the return process is easy.Jewelry brands with customer-friendly return policies experience up to 20 percent higher repeat purchase rates.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"grQ0voO36af5qlstpxx8540QTscNOKEMiGasiNm1//U=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"73bf7c89-8848-42f7-a00b-4b4595aa3fb3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"73bf7c89-8848-42f7-a00b-4b4595aa3fb3\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"c9048d00-5fd9-497d-af33-569a72885b90\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"k61hBf4rrOVHslJScZvBKdJE0X82unsYPBRl0HT9lnw=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"30da463c-5566-45cb-9a01-083240420ac5\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"+TV11iX+vykPoLq8i6WWoM+g3/YW8lkg/jl1fle1Ntk=\"}},\"text\":\"This

age has ushered in a new era of retail—one driven by discovery rather than necessity.This shift towards \\\"discovery commerce\\\" is redefining consumer behavior and transforming the Indian retail landscape.Rather than traditional, search-based shopping, consumers are being captivated by products through entertainment and social engagement.Platforms like Roposo are at the forefront of this revolution, integrating discovery commerce into their business model.Mansi Jain, Senior Vice President & GM of Roposo, shared insights into this exciting trend and its broader implications for the retail industry in an exclusive conversation with IndianRetailer.The Evolution of Discovery Commerce\\nAt its core, discovery commerce involves spontaneous purchasing, often inspired by visual or social content.It is about creating an emotional connection, pulling consumers into the buying journey when they least expect it.Unlike traditional e-commerce, where consumers seek specific products, discovery commerce prompts unplanned purchases based on inspiration.\\\"Discovery commerce is about sparking joy and curiosity,\\\" says Mansi Jain.\\\"It’s the digital version of window shopping, but much more immersive.Consumers are not just seeing a product—they're experiencing it.Whether through influencer-driven content or dynamic fashion hauls, platforms like ours create moments of delight that lead to unexpected purchases.\\\"This experiential form of commerce is rapidly growing.According to a BCG-TikTok study, shoppertainment—commerce blended with entertainment—is projected to become a $1 trillion industry in Asia-Pacific alone.For Indian retailers, this shift represents a vast opportunity to engage consumers in a new, highly interactive way.The Power of Content and Community\\nPlatforms like Roposo seamlessly blend product discovery with entertainment and social interactions.From makeup tutorials to fashion reviews, the platform integrates commerce into engaging content, ensuring that the viewer's journey from discovery to purchase is smooth and intuitive.\\\"Our goal is to make the shopping experience feel like a natural extension of the content,\\\" explains Jain.\\\"We show consumers what’s trending, but in a way that resonates emotionally.A skit, a product review, a behind-the-scenes look—all these forms of content foster a sense of community.It's more than shopping; it’s belonging to a trend.\\\"Roposo’s ability to create communities around these trends sets it apart from traditional e-commerce.When consumers see their favorite influencers wearing a specific brand or style, they are more likely to trust and purchase those products.By building this kind of connection, the platform fosters brand loyalty and customer engagement on a deeper level.The Role of AI in Personalization\\nPersonalization plays a crucial role in discovery commerce, and advanced technologies like AI are driving this shift.Platforms like Roposo use AI to track consumer preferences, ensuring that the content and products they see align with their interests.\\\"We are constantly analyzing purchasing patterns and browsing behavior to refine the user experience,\\\" says Jain.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"mnfktku+anq7ad4UtbtWiy0/1ciinn6nD1ypBPpsOwE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"30da463c-5566-45cb-9a01-083240420ac5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"30da463c-5566-45cb-9a01-083240420ac5\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"73bf7c89-8848-42f7-a00b-4b4595aa3fb3\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"ZsKh5mfQJU5s9aFS3iYJ8uO2PaRPUh3PgYo+D/IlrJg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"9eac10ed-422d-41ba-9702-24ec4dbd7d3c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"YpAd1t1zlhbOZ+TBg3BFMaFECeCAmSZsGQxwSTn1wqQ=\"}},\"text\":\"\\\"We

preferences, ensuring that the content and products they see align with their interests.\\\"We are constantly analyzing purchasing patterns and browsing behavior to refine the user experience,\\\" says Jain.\\\"AI helps us understand what a user might like based on their past interactions.It's about making the content—and the shopping experience—personalized and frictionless.\\\"By offering recommendations tailored to individual preferences, platforms are creating a more engaging and convenient shopping environment, which ultimately drives higher conversions.For retailers, this means investing in AI-powered solutions is no longer optional—it’s essential.Shoppertainment\\nIndia's diverse consumer base makes it a fertile ground for discovery commerce, particularly among Gen Z and millennials.As these younger consumers embrace social platforms for entertainment, they’re also embracing new ways to shop.Roposo’s shoppertainment model—where content and commerce merge—allows brands to tap into this demographic.\\\"Gen Z, in particular, values experiences over products,\\\" notes Jain.\\\"They want to be entertained and inspired, and then, if they see something they like, they’ll buy it.That’s the magic of shoppertainment—it turns passive viewers into active shoppers.\\\"This phenomenon is reshaping the way retailers and brands think about customer engagement.Retailers can no longer rely solely on product descriptions and reviews.Instead, they must create interactive, story-driven experiences that appeal to emotion as much as practicality.The Impact on Traditional Retail\\nDiscovery commerce is not just a digital trend; it's influencing offline retail as well.As consumers become accustomed to engaging, personalized content, they expect the same from physical stores.Retailers are now tasked with creating immersive, in-store experiences that mirror the online journey.\\\"Consumers want seamless transitions between online and offline,\\\" says Jain.\\\"When they see something online that inspires them, they expect to find it in stores too.This convergence of digital and physical retail is the future.\\\"Retailers embracing this shift are blending discovery with convenience, incorporating elements of shoppertainment into their physical spaces.Interactive displays, in-store influencers, and experiential marketing are becoming key strategies in capturing consumer interest.A Growing Ecosystem of Partnerships\\nOne of the keys to success in the discovery commerce landscape is building strong partnerships.Roposo has strategically collaborated with brands like Campus Sutra and Uptownie to enhance its offerings and connect with established audiences.\\\"Partnerships are crucial in the fast-moving world of shoppertainment,\\\" says Jain.\\\"They allow us to bring fresh, engaging content to our users while giving brands access to a highly engaged audience.It’s a win-win.\\\"These partnerships also allow brands to capitalize on the platform’s reach, integrating their products into a seamless content-to-commerce journey.For Roposo, this approach has proven successful in expanding its user base and driving revenue growth.The Road Ahead\\nLooking to the future, Mansi Jain is optimistic about the potential for discovery commerce in India.As AI and content creation technologies evolve, platforms like Roposo are poised to take full advantage of the growing demand for personalized, shoppable content.\\\"Discovery commerce will only become more prevalent,\\\" she asserts.\\\"We’re working on tools that empower creators to produce high-quality, shoppable content with ease.This will democratize content creation and allow brands to engage with consumers in more meaningful ways.\\\"In a market as dynamic as India, where social interaction and commerce are deeply intertwined, discovery commerce offers a powerful way forward.For retailers, it’s about creating experiences, not just transactions—building relationships rather than simply selling products.As the lines between entertainment, community, and commerce continue to blur, discovery commerce is set to reshape the future of retail in India and beyond.e-eCommerceretail India\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nEnhancing On-Shelf Availability: A Festive Season Blueprint for E-commerce Businesses\\nBY - Guest author\\nAug 31, 2024 / 11

author\\nAug 31, 2024 / 11 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  As consumers across the world embrace e-commerce businesses, OSA has become extremely critical in the current and future online markets.With the latest numbers from Future Market Insights, the global on-shelf availability solution market is set to hit the desired figure of $4.8 billion by 2024.Analyses show that this market will even continue to grow to a whopping $11.6 billion by 2034, such that there is a healthy CAGR of 9.1 percent in the market during the research period of the forecast.These figures explain the growing need to manage OSA as e-commerce firms seek to deliver what consumers want, especially during holidays such as this festive season.On the one hand, the festive season is a unique chance to boost sales and make customers happy for e-commerce organizations.But with the growing demands comes the question of availability—having the right product at the right time and place.OSA is important during this period because a stockout situation will mean no sales, unsatisfied consumers, and loss of brand loyalty.For e-commerce businesses gearing up for the festive season, here is the ultimate guide to improving on-shelf availability.1.Demand Forecasting and Inventory Planning\\nAccurate demand forecasting is the foundation of high OSA during the festive season.E-commerce businesses must analyze historical sales data, market trends, and competitor behavior, while also considering potential events, holidays, and promotions that could drive demand.Leveraging analytics and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance these forecasts, ensuring that inventory levels are aligned with expected demand.Inventory planning should be conducted in tandem with demand forecasting, taking into account supply chain disruptions, supplier capabilities, and lead times.While it's advisable to stock up on frequently sold products, businesses should avoid overstocking to minimize holding costs and prevent markdowns post-season.2.Strengthening Supplier Relationships\\nThe festive season is one of the important periods requiring suppliers to meet their commitments at high levels.It is necessary for e-commerce businesses to clearly convey the demand that they expect in the future to their suppliers so that the required capacities are available to meet such demands.Loyal supplier relationships mean that a company will be accorded special treatment, including priority on the stocks to be restocked and the time that it takes to have them restocked.Also, risks of supply chain disruption may be addressed by the expansion of the suppliers’ list.This means that if one supplier is unable to supply essentials, having other sources available can help minimize the chances of running out of stock.3.Leveraging Technology for Real-Time Inventory Management\\nOrganizations need to employ real-time inventory management systems in order to maintain OSA during the festivities.These systems facilitate the monitoring of stock in different sales outlets and stores, giving a clear view of inventory.These systems can then be linked to e-commerce to automatically update stock status so that the customers do not get the wrong impression of what is available in the warehouse.Furthermore, real-time inventory means that inventory management decisions have to be made in a short span of time.In cases where a particular product is selling much faster than expected, call for automatic re-ordering or transfer of stock in anticipation of the popular item.4.Optimizing fulfillment and logistics\\nThe idea of smooth functioning of fulfillment and logistics is key to sustaining OSA during the festive period.Fulfillment centers should be evaluated and possibly altered to make certain that the products are picked, packed, and shipped as quickly as possible.This might have entailed efficiencies in the processes of the warehouse, hiring of more workers, or outsourcing the extra load to a third-party company.Another important element that must be taken into consideration is last-mile delivery.Cutting costs and improving delivery reliability can be accomplished through choosing credible courier services and providing numerous delivery choices for customers, and they can also help minimize stockouts.One might also suggest adopting the distribution center strategy, which means warehousing is closer to certain key markets to reduce lead time and increase OSA.5.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"6FVMIlB/pneS5ckWfDAw8KVsAUD9QYXz8MJftkEmcdg=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"27968276-1465-4931-8018-3155907bc666":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"27968276-1465-4931-8018-3155907bc666\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9eac10ed-422d-41ba-9702-24ec4dbd7d3c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"YpAd1t1zlhbOZ+TBg3BFMaFECeCAmSZsGQxwSTn1wqQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"37713c18-24ad-4ca2-b677-14983fd933d8\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"LsPG/QhdAWOffItJwUK5ywzWOV5juV8+YRCSFFpfGjw=\"}},\"text\":\"In

warehousing is closer to certain key markets to reduce lead time and increase OSA.5.Dynamic Pricing and Promotions Management\\nFor OSA, particularly during the festive season, price and promotional strategies can play a great deal.It is recommended that e-commerce businesses should implement dynamic pricing models as a way of controlling the demand, especially where the retail price can be changed based on the existing sales data and available stock.For instance, if a given product is going around very fast in the market, some price increases can be made in order to regulate demand and scarcity.Promotions also must be accurately determined and controlled.Although using discounts and special offers promotes the products, it also contributes to exhaustion.Promotion decisions should be made with consideration to stock status, firms should offer either substitute options or pack slow-movers together with the best sellers in order to ensure equal sales of all stock.6.Enhancing Customer Communication\\nIt demonstrated that customers should be informed clearly and in advance when OSA is in operation during the festive season.If a product is unavailable or lost, it is important to advise the clients to prevent cases of disappointment.That is why revealing similar goods’ availability, giving options to pre-order, or offering back-in-stock notifications also contribute to maintaining customers who might switch to other suppliers.Moreover, businesses should employ customers’ information to get in touch with the customers in subsequent purchases and remind them of potential products they have bought in the past or related to.This does not only improve the experience of shoppers but also creates demand for the available products in the market.7.Post-Season Analysis and Continuous Improvement\\nAfter the festive season, conducting a thorough performance analysis based on OSA key indicators is crucial.Businesses should evaluate areas of success and identify opportunities for improvement.Key metrics to assess include the number of stockouts, replenishment times, and the accuracy of demand forecasts.Insights gained from this analysis should be used to refine processes, strengthen supplier relationships, and enhance inventory management for future high-demand periods.Maintaining availability during the holiday season is a difficult but essential process for many e-commerce companies.Through demand forecasting, building supplier relations, being able to manage inventory in real-time, choosing the best options for fulfilling orders, using dynamic pricing options, being able to communicate effectively with customers, and analyzing data after the season, businesses can increase their sales while also providing a good shopping experience for the consumer.These strategies assist not only in getting through the holiday season but also in excelling during the period.Authored By\\nPunit Sindhwani, Founder & CEO,

worth $46.67 billion were placed in India last fiscal year, putting these businesses under significant pressure to not just deliver seamless and convenient customer experiences, but to do so at

willing to spend more on brands that offer personalized and streamlined services.AI will play a pivotal role in every customer interaction, particularly as an overwhelming majority of CX leaders in India anticipate a five-fold increase in customer service interactions in the next three years, according to the Zendesk Future of AI-powered CX report.And many brands are turning to technologies such

& E-commerce\\nThe Future of E-Commerce: Integrating AI and Virtual Reality for an Immersive Retail Experience\\nBY - Guest author\\nAug 24, 2024 / 9 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Online shopping is quickly evolving with the help of new technology.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) are making shopping more interactive and personalized.According to Mordor Intelligence, the AI in Retail market is estimated to be worth $9.85 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $40.49 billion by 2029.This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.68 percent from 2024 to 2029.Also, the market size for Virtual Reality in Retail was valued at  $3.18 billion in 2023 (Market Research Future).Additionally, a study by Deloitte and Snap found that 67 percent of people globally use AR at home, and 41 percent of them use it for shopping.As these technologies become more common, they will greatly change the way we shop online.Making Shopping Easier with AI and VR\\nAI and VR are changing how customers interact with online stores.One of the most notable examples is Sephora’s Virtual Artist.This tool uses AI to let customers virtually try on makeup products, from lipstick to eyeshadow.By simply uploading a photo, users can see how different shades will look on their faces, helping them choose the right product without the guesswork.This not only enhances the

capabilities.The IKEA app enables customers to use VR to visualize how furniture will look in their homes before making a purchase.By immersing themselves in a virtual environment, users can place 3D models of furniture in their own spaces, helping them make more informed decisions.This level of convenience is becoming increasingly important as online shopping continues to grow.Reducing Cart Abandonment with AR and VR\\nCart abandonment is a significant challenge in e-commerce, with nearly 78.65% of shoppers leaving items in their carts without completing the purchase, according to Barilliance.Integrating AI and VR into e-commerce platforms can help address this issue by reducing the uncertainty that often leads to cart abandonment.For example, AI-powered recommendations can tailor product suggestions based on customer behavior, while VR enables customers to virtually try on products or visualize them in their homes.These technologies enhance the shopping experience, making it easier for customers to make informed decisions and complete their purchases.As a result, retailers benefit from improved customer satisfaction and increased conversion rates, making AI and VR invaluable tools for reducing cart abandonment.Connecting with Customers in More Interactive Ways\\nAI and VR are transforming how retailers engage with customers, offering new levels of interactivity.These technologies enable the creation of virtual showrooms where customers can explore products in an immersive environment.This enhanced engagement can significantly impact purchasing decisions.For instance, Sephora’s Virtual Artist leverages AI and VR to allow users to try on makeup virtually and access tutorials on achieving various looks.This interactive approach not only provides a unique and valuable experience but also fosters brand loyalty by engaging customers in a meaningful way.Saving Time and Money for Shoppers\\nAI and VR are making online shopping more convenient than ever.These technologies save customers time by allowing them to try products virtually instead of visiting physical stores.This is particularly useful for items like furniture and makeup, where seeing the product in context can make a big difference.Moreover, AR and VR can lead to cost savings for consumers.By providing a realistic preview of products, these technologies help

create immersive retail environments.By leveraging VR, retailers can design virtual versions of their physical stores, allowing customers to explore products in a simulated space.This not only replicates the in-store experience but also introduces features that are impossible in the physical world.For example, virtual stores can be dynamically updated to reflect seasonal trends or customer preferences, thanks to AI-driven insights.This keeps the shopping experience fresh and engaging, encouraging customers to return and explore new offerings.What’s Next for E-Commerce?The integration of AI and VR in e-commerce is still in its early stages, but the potential is enormous.As these technologies become more widespread, they will likely redefine the online shopping experience.By enabling customers to explore products in a more interactive and personalized way, AI and VR will play a key role in the future of e-commerce.As the AI and VR markets continue to expand, with the global AI market projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3 percent from 2023 to 2030, reaching $1,811.8 billion by 2030 (GrandViewResearch), and the global VR market expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.9 percent, reaching approximately $187.28 billion by 2032 (Precedence Research), e-commerce will increasingly rely on these technologies to enhance customer experiences and drive sales.Retailers who adopt AI and VR early will be well-positioned to lead in this new era of online shopping.Authored By\\nPiyush Gupta, CEO, VOSMOS\\n  e-commerceArtificial intelligenceVirtual

659 million smartphone users, the second largest smartphone user base in the world.Internet penetration, mobile-first infotainment and financial platforms, and superlative camera features are some of the contributing factors to the growth of smartphone aspirations, even in Tier II and below towns.However, aspiration needs affordability to create a market.This is where pre-owned smartphones come into play.Industry estimates project that the overall pre-owned smartphone market in India is close to $5 billion and is expected to reach $10 billion by 2030.The organised segment accounts for 20-25 percent of the current market.This segment is largely made up of online platforms that enable consumers to buy authentic pre-owned smartphones, along with various value-added benefits.These platforms, including several new entrants, are not only reshaping consumer behaviour but also propelling technological advancements and sustainability initiatives.Let us see how online businesses, particularly newer players, are playing a pivotal role in the pre-owned smartphone industry in India.Consumer Behaviour: Convenience and Affordability\\nNew online platforms have made it incredibly convenient for consumers to buy and sell pre-owned smartphones.The typical hassles of offline transactions, like trust deficit and the long time required to identify buyers or sellers, have already been tackled to a great extent.These new brands provide user-friendly interfaces, detailed product listings, and secure payment gateways that add to the user’s convenience.Apart from convenience, consumers also look for affordability when it comes to changing or upgrading their smartphones.With the tech advancements, more consumers are willing to try out the newly launched high-end phones.New platforms allow them to sell their old devices so that they can partially fund their new purchases.Consumers can also fund the gap between their sales and purchase prices through easy EMIs.Thus, consumers can access a range of smartphones at significantly lower prices than new models, making technology accessible.Ensuring Quality and Trust\\nThe quality and authenticity of Pre-Owned smartphones has always been a big concern for consumers.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"SqibJVtqeZwxJo1eBgvsIkFsRjT+NLiVuJtkmu0KVUw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9842b6f9-c31e-4b6d-9bec-e3a4af1ea01f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9842b6f9-c31e-4b6d-9bec-e3a4af1ea01f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"e7efeb9b-c10a-4dcf-bba2-48733b87709a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"3/3PwRwsvfxPZCCT4IpqSlDjoAEL2nrwkXLuFR23Jsg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"22f840ce-008e-4c79-a96d-9e838a7fc284\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"gpHOBMjrlCMGDkcm9xL8w7S8mvS7BDnofjAeLznmJbQ=\"}},\"text\":\"The

prices than new models, making technology accessible.Ensuring Quality and Trust\\nThe quality and authenticity of Pre-Owned smartphones has always been a big concern for consumers.To address this, many online platforms now offer certified pre-owned phones that have been thoroughly inspected on many parameters and have gone through multiple quality checks.This assures the consumers that their phones are in good working condition.The additional guarantee provided by the platform takes this confidence a notch further.Sustainability Initiatives: Promoting a Circular Economy\\nThe Pre-Owned smartphone market contributes significantly to the cause of environmental sustainability.By extending the life cycle of smartphones, online platforms focus on the reduction of manufacturing and electronic waste, which is a growing concern globally.Although India's 'Make in India' initiative aims to boost local manufacturing, the reality includes a complex landscape.While many components are sourced locally, high-end parts often need to be imported due to supply chain constraints.Unfortunately, these imports face steep tariffs aimed at protecting domestic manufacturers, thereby increasing overall production costs.However, India faces challenges in becoming a dominant manufacturing hub.Key issues include deficiencies in infrastructure, such as inadequate transportation networks and limited access to advanced technology and connectivity.These deficiencies can significantly hinder manufacturing productivity and operational efficiency.Despite these challenges, India possesses substantial potential as a manufacturing destination.Addressing infrastructure gaps and improving 'ease of doing business' metrics are critical steps to unlock this potential fully.Additionally, proactive steps to integrate more seamlessly into the global tech manufacturing supply chain will be essential for India to capitalise on its strengths and attract further investment.\\\"Challenges and the Road Ahead\\nDespite the significant progress made by multiple online platforms, there are still some challenges.As mentioned earlier in the article, a large chunk of the Pre-Owned phone market is still unorganised.Here, the consumers are always prone to issues such as poor quality and the lack of standardization.Moreover, in some consumer segments, there is still an underlying perception about used smartphones being inferior in quality.They need to continue investing in technology and customer education to come around these issues.Enhancing transparency through detailed product information, and warranties, and providing credible after-sales service will help consumers feel more confident about their purchases.Additionally, these platforms can also collaborate with manufacturers and authorized service providers to standardize the refurbishment process.This will provide a consistent supply of high-quality pre-owned smartphones.While the challenges are steep, the current trend indicates that online platforms will be able to address most of these.This will also help them play an even more important role in Digital India.Authored By \\nYug Bhatia, CEO and

a figure that eclipsed the growth of traditional e-commerce by nearly fivefold.However, the question remains: how long can Q-commerce sustain this meteoric rise?The Rise of Q-Commerce\\nIndia's urban population, especially Generation Z and millennials, is leading the charge in the adoption of Q-commerce.These consumers value convenience and speed, preferring to have products delivered to their doorstep rather than spending time at physical stores.The demand for on-demand shopping solutions saw Q-commerce platforms like Swiggy Instamart, Dunzo, and Zepto thrive, even as similar models floundered in other global markets.Key drivers of growth include:\\nIncreasing User Base: The Average Monthly Transacting Users (MTU) grew by over 40 percent in FY24.This surge in users was largely driven by the younger, tech-savvy generation in metro cities who have embraced the convenience of ordering essentials and non-essentials alike at the click of a button.Habit Formation: The ordering frequency per user jumped from 4.4 times a month in FY21 to nearly 6 in FY24, indicating that consumers are now using Q-commerce platforms not just for infrequent top-ups but for regular stock-ups.This shift in consumer behavior is a result of growing trust in these platforms and their ability to deliver consistently.Higher Spending Per User: The average order value (AOV) on Q-commerce platforms increased by more than 15 percent in FY24, thanks to the rise in event-driven purchases and the diversification of categories.Consumers now use Q-commerce platforms for everything from daily essentials to specialized goods such as beauty products, home decor, and gifting items.Metro Domination: In FY24, nearly 90 percent of the Q-commerce market was concentrated in metro cities.These densely populated urban centers are ripe for Q-commerce, where consumers prioritize time-saving and convenience.What to Expect in FY25 and Beyond\\nThe growth trajectory of Q-commerce shows no signs of slowing down.According to Redseer’s projections, the Q-commerce market is expected to grow by 75-85 percent in FY25, potentially reaching a GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) of around $6 billion.This will be fueled by an additional 5 million new MTUs, further expanding the user base.Existing users, too, are expected to spend more, with projections suggesting a 20 percent increase in expenditure on Q-commerce platforms.This uptick will be driven by increased trust and habit formation, along with experimentation in newer propositions such as sustainable products, health-oriented offerings, and non-essential categories.These developments will likely attract consumers to explore more diverse options, including luxury items and general merchandise beyond groceries.As demand grows, so too will the infrastructure.Q-commerce platforms are expected to add at least 500 new dark stores (warehouses for quick delivery) across India, with a focus on the top 30-50 cities.These dark stores will optimize delivery logistics and improve the throughput of existing operations, ensuring that platforms maintain their competitive advantage.When Will the Boom Stabilize?While the growth of Q-commerce appears unstoppable, experts predict that the market will stabilize in the coming years.By FY26, India’s Q-commerce user base is expected to reach around 20 million MTUs, at which point the growth rate may begin to plateau.This mirrors trends seen in the food delivery sector, where growth slows after reaching a certain user saturation point.The majority of new users in the next few years will come from the top 30-50 cities, while expansion into smaller towns and rural areas will remain limited to experimentation.The current dark-store model may not be viable in less dense markets due to logistical challenges and lower demand.However, platforms may explore alternative models, such as partnering with local Kirana stores for fulfillment in smaller cities.While there is skepticism about the scalability of this approach, Q-commerce could surprise the market as it did last year.Innovations in Q-Commerce\\nThe versatility of Q-commerce platforms has already been demonstrated, from delivering daily essentials to luxury items.As platforms continue to evolve, several potential innovations could shape the future of Q-commerce in India:\\nVirtual Storefronts: Imagine walking into your favorite brand's local store—not physically, but virtually through a Q-commerce platform.The integration of virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) could allow

Recommendations for Profitability & Growth\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nAug 12, 2024 / 10 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In an era where digital transformation is reshaping every industry, the grocery sector is no exception.To stay competitive and profitable, grocers must navigate the complexities of digital commerce with a customer-centric approach.However, many grocers struggle to deliver a profitable digital offering due to legacy systems and siloed operations.According to Capgemini’s latest report, these five strategic recommendations guide the development of a successful, sustainable, and scalable digital grocery capability, emphasizing the importance of data integration, advanced technologies like AI and generative AI (GenAI), and a strong focus on customer needs.1.Develop a Customer-Centric Strategy\\nThe cornerstone of a successful digital grocery solution is a deep understanding of the customer.Grocers must acknowledge that they cannot cater to everyone; instead, they should focus on identifying and prioritizing key customer segments.Developing a customer-centric strategy involves creating a clear vision of who the primary customers are, what they need, and what motivates their purchasing decisions.These insights will inform the design of the digital offering, from product selection to fulfillment options.For instance, some customers may prioritize convenience and speed, while others may value product variety or price.By understanding these preferences, grocers can tailor their digital services to meet the specific needs of their target audience.This might involve offering a range of fulfillment options, such as quick delivery for time-sensitive orders or next-day delivery for those who plan their shopping in advance.Additionally, grocers should consider enabling personalized recommendations and offers, which can increase customer loyalty and drive repeat business.2.Refine Existing Systems to Enhance the Experience and Optimize Operations\\nMany grocers are currently operating with legacy systems that were not designed for the demands of digital fulfillment.These systems, often hastily adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic, are typically difficult to optimize and rarely enable profitable operations.To unlock the revenue potential of digital grocery, grocers must be willing to overhaul their existing infrastructure and embrace new ways of working.This transformation requires strategic investments in modern systems and digital solutions powered by AI and GenAI.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"Jd1PVfxjWbms1zrIBC8HFPxPRhvbvXlSAnw/ut84+Lc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0347899e-d2fa-4953-a706-9211a3a2a163":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0347899e-d2fa-4953-a706-9211a3a2a163\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"77930c74-3641-45dc-9979-99242ec5945b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"m3A0ImdTW+WGTi2B/RVLRJoFwiYs0dQvDj+rRaONrjg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"0da16e92-0d3a-42e5-b3ce-b9e82569d3ee\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"6B7m7R3PATA27T76btsgPYLB1W16DpEEEBdGUGNPAYk=\"}},\"text\":\"For

shopping in advance.Additionally, grocers should consider enabling personalized recommendations and offers, which can increase customer loyalty and drive repeat business.2.Refine Existing Systems to Enhance the Experience and Optimize Operations\\nMany grocers are currently operating with legacy systems that were not designed for the demands of digital fulfillment.These systems, often hastily adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic, are typically difficult to optimize and rarely enable profitable operations.To unlock the revenue potential of digital grocery, grocers must be willing to overhaul their existing infrastructure and embrace new ways of working.This transformation requires strategic investments in modern systems and digital solutions powered by AI and GenAI.Such technologies can enhance both sides of the customer promise—availability and fulfillment—by automating processes, improving accuracy, and enabling more agile operations.For example, AI-driven demand forecasting can help grocers maintain optimal inventory levels, reducing stockouts and overstock situations.GenAI can also be leveraged to create more personalized shopping experiences, generating tailored recommendations and offers based on real-time customer data.However, grocers must be cautious of falling into the trap of investing in point solutions that only address specific issues without considering the broader business strategy.To avoid deepening silos within the organization, investments should be aligned with the overall digital strategy and aimed at creating a seamless, integrated experience for customers.3.Prioritize Investments That Maximize Profitability\\nDigital grocery is a challenging space with razor-thin margins, making it crucial for grocers to carefully evaluate their investments.To ensure long-term growth and sustainability, grocers should prioritize developing capabilities that have a clear and significant impact on profitability.One area of investment that can deliver substantial returns is improving the accuracy of availability data.Inaccurate data can disrupt order fulfillment, leading to costly substitutions, increased food waste, and poor replenishment decisions—all of which negatively impact profitability.By contrast, accurate availability data can streamline operations, reduce waste, and enhance customer satisfaction.While personalization is another valuable capability, its impact is often limited by the grocer’s data maturity.Without the ability to scale personalized initiatives, the return on investment may be marginal.Therefore, grocers should focus on building data maturity and ensuring that their data infrastructure supports high-precision availability and fulfillment before expanding into more advanced personalization efforts.4.Develop a Flexible Fulfillment Infrastructure and Network\\nThe fulfillment stage is critical to the success of any digital grocery offering.Customers today expect a seamless experience that balances speed, convenience, and affordability.However, the importance of these factors varies from one customer to another, making it essential for grocers to develop a flexible fulfillment infrastructure that can cater to diverse needs.Grocers have several options for fulfilling digital orders, including internal delivery services, third-party partnerships, high-tech solutions like drones or robots, and click-and-collect services.Each option comes with its own set of advantages and challenges, and the right choice will depend on the specific needs of the target customer base.Last-mile delivery is particularly important, as it directly influences customer satisfaction and their likelihood of returning.While optimizing costs is essential, grocers must remember that last-mile delivery is not just an expense—it’s a critical touchpoint in the customer journey.A well-executed last-mile strategy can enhance the overall shopping experience, building customer loyalty and driving repeat purchases.5.Build Data Maturity to Achieve High-Precision Availability and Fulfillment\\nData maturity is a key enabler of a successful digital grocery strategy.Many grocers currently rely on historical data or generic customer profiles, which limits their ability to provide a responsive and personalized experience.To achieve high-precision availability and fulfillment, grocers must integrate and synchronize disparate data sources, enabling a more accurate understanding of customer behavior and inventory levels.Advanced analytics, AI, and GenAI can play a crucial role in this process.By leveraging these technologies, grocers can gain real-time insights into customer preferences, optimize inventory management, and enhance the overall efficiency of their operations.For example, AI can be used to predict demand patterns, allowing grocers to adjust their inventory and fulfillment strategies accordingly.GenAI can also help in creating dynamic pricing models that respond to changes in demand, maximizing profitability.Moreover, a mature data infrastructure can support the personalization of the customer experience.By analyzing customer data, grocers

Matrix: Unveiling the 'Whys' Behind Success and Challenges\\nBY - Guest author\\nAug 10, 2024 / 10 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The rapid growth of eCommerce in recent years has created a situation where competition is fierce.In this highly competitive market, understanding the eCommerce matrix is crucial for brands who want to succeed.Making decisions based on intuition alone can lead to suboptimal outcomes, which can be costly in an industry as unforgiving as eCommerce.As more businesses enter the online space, standing out becomes harder, making it imperative for brands to decode their performance metrics to identify what drives success and what hinders growth.Success Factors in eCommerce\\nData analytics is at the heart of successful eCommerce strategies.It allows brands to make informed decisions, outperform competitors, and adapt to market changes swiftly.By using data, brands can get insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends, allowing them to build their marketing efforts effectively.For example, personalization in marketing, driven by data, significantly enhances customer loyalty and boosts sales.80 percent of consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences.When data informs decisions, every aspect of the business, from marketing strategies to inventory management, is optimized for better results.Third-party data further enriches this process, offering benchmarks and industry trends that help brands stay ahead.The use of data analytics not only improves operational efficiency but also ensures that marketing efforts resonate with the target audience, driving engagement and conversions.Analyzing the 'Whys' Behind eCommerce Performance\\nRetail success is not a one-time achievement.High sales in one quarter do not guarantee sustained performance.Understanding why sales were strong in a particular period is essential for replicating that success.For example, if a retailer experiences a spike in sales, identifying the metrics that drove this increase—such as a successful marketing campaign or a popular product launch—provides actionable insights for future strategies.Similarly, analyzing poor performance is crucial.If a campaign underperforms, brands must identify the root causes to make improvements.Was the targeting off?Or was the targeting right but the audience didn’t find the creatives to be relatable?By pinpointing these issues, brands can refine their approaches and avoid repeating mistakes.For example, if a marketing campaign fails, analyzing factors like audience segmentation, messaging, and ad placement can reveal areas for improvement.The Answer Is Not Always Simple\\nBrands often oversimplify the reasons behind their eCommerce performance.If revenue dips, they might quickly attribute it to lower traffic and stop there.However, eCommerce outcomes are complex and require a deeper analysis to identify the true causes.In reality, the drop in revenue could indeed be due to decreased traffic, but what caused the decline in traffic?Perhaps the marketing campaigns didn’t perform as expected.Then the question becomes, what specifically underperformed in the campaigns?It could be incorrect targeting or unrelatable creatives.This process illustrates the importance of drilling down into multiple layers to identify the root cause of eCommerce performance issues.To find comprehensive answers, brands need to analyze top-level metrics:\\nTraffic Analysis: Examine traffic sources and their impact on sales.Conversion Rate Optimization: Improve conversion rates through A/B testing, user feedback, and other techniques.Revenue Drivers: Identify and optimize key revenue drivers.Customer Retention: Implement strategies for retaining customers and increasing their lifetime value.Each of these metrics can be further divided to gain deeper insights:\\nTraffic Analysis: Break down by channel (organic, paid, referral), geography, and device.Conversion Rate Optimization: Segment by landing page performance, checkout process analysis, and user journey mapping.Revenue Drivers: Analyze by product categories, pricing strategies, and promotional effectiveness.Customer Retention: Assess loyalty program engagement, repeat purchase rates, and customer satisfaction scores.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"u4NQ2WDXN0VosHPjzSfaUVXwBSPszwPDvNXr7Bse9oo=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e68f1fd3-0b69-421d-9dad-6847b7029c49":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e68f1fd3-0b69-421d-9dad-6847b7029c49\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"0da16e92-0d3a-42e5-b3ce-b9e82569d3ee\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"6B7m7R3PATA27T76btsgPYLB1W16DpEEEBdGUGNPAYk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"8bbaffa7-ddea-4d39-ae66-ad773ff56b8c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Z9iWBzFYWbxYv+6pKqiV6h1n3cMTEGtnpq5RkWtJWcw=\"}},\"text\":\"It

effectiveness.Customer Retention: Assess loyalty program engagement, repeat purchase rates, and customer satisfaction scores.By thoroughly examining these metrics and their subcategories, brands can find the complex factors affecting their eCommerce performance and develop targeted strategies to address them.Tools and Technologies for eCommerce Success\\nGiven the complexity of analyzing multiple metrics accurately, relying solely on human judgment is impractical.Cognitive biases can skew analysis, leading to incorrect conclusions.For example, if sales are low, business owners might blame the marketing team without considering other factors like product demand.To overcome these challenges, brands need advanced analytics tools that provide accurate insights.Powered by AI and machine learning algorithms, these tools can analyze vast amounts of data, including sales, customer behavior, and marketing performance, to offer a holistic view of the business.Brands can easily identify patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent.For example, an analytics tool might reveal that a decline in sales is due to a drop in repeat purchases rather than a decrease in new customer acquisition.Such insights are invaluable for making strategic decisions that drive growth and improve performance.Takeaway\\nTo repeat success and avoid repeating failures, it is crucial for brands to understand the reasons behind their performance.Data-driven decision-making is essential for dealing with the challenges of the eCommerce matrix.Every eCommerce decision made with the help of data has far more chance of success compared to those based on intuition alone!Authored By\\n  Prem Bhatia, CEO and Co-Founder Graas\\n  e-commerceBrandsOnline\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nIndia's Lifestyle Market Set to Hit $210 Bn by 2028 with 22 pc Online Growth\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nAug 09, 2024 / 11 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  India's lifestyle market, currently valued at a staggering $130 billion, is on its way to a significant transformation.Fashion dominates this market, accounting for approximately 80 percent, with beauty and personal care (BPC) making up the remainder.Over the next five years, this market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10–12 percent, reaching a projected $210 billion.This growth will be primarily driven by the organized segment, which is gaining traction as consumers increasingly seek quality, branded products.A recent study conducted by Bain & Company in collaboration with Myntra sheds light on the rapid evolution of India's e-lifestyle market.Currently valued at $16–$17 billion in 2023, the e-lifestyle market is expected to more than double to an impressive $40–$45 billion by 2028.This robust growth trajectory is being fueled by a combination of favorable economic conditions and structural shifts in consumer behavior.Driving Factors Behind the Growth\\nThe anticipated growth in India's e-lifestyle market can be attributed to several key factors.First, the easing of short-term inflationary pressures is expected to stimulate consumer spending.Additionally, there are structural shifts that are creating a more favorable demand environment.These include a rise in disposable incomes, a growing base of fashion-forward and digitally native Gen-Z shoppers, and an increasing demand for organized and branded products.The market is also benefiting from superior customer value propositions offered by online platforms.These include a trendy and wide-ranging selection of products, faster delivery times, easier returns, and a tech-enabled shopping experience.Social media is playing a pivotal role in product discovery, further enhancing the shopping experience.Moreover, the growth of omnichannel access, where consumers can seamlessly transition between online and offline shopping, is bridging the gap between India and more mature e-lifestyle markets like the US, China, and Germany, which boast over 35 percent e-lifestyle penetration.In India, e-lifestyle penetration is projected to grow from 13 percent to an impressive 18–22 percent over the next five years.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"zIqeaBfL7uigOpsOeQJYSR1d8qRREKOzL6s5fFh7eFo=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8bbaffa7-ddea-4d39-ae66-ad773ff56b8c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8bbaffa7-ddea-4d39-ae66-ad773ff56b8c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"e68f1fd3-0b69-421d-9dad-6847b7029c49\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"l0x4f5vYC9l4xNvu2nLR4YDM3BGBLispiWcOgj9/MGU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"dc999e6b-60ee-4666-b874-63e149c33e55\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"gQr/0IEEsTpuGrZpGLJ1wrXkYzjAED0BMiChD0DbQxY=\"}},\"text\":\"Additionally,

the next five years.\\\"India’s e-lifestyle market has come of age in the last few years, with a diverse shopper base.Two out of three online shoppers are from beyond the top 50 cities, one in two are from non-affluent segments, and one in three are Gen-Z.There still exists massive penetration headroom.One in five dollars spent on lifestyle will be online,” said Shyam Unnikrishnan, Partner at Bain & Company.Fashion Leading the Charge\\nCurrently, the e-lifestyle market in India is dominated by fashion, which makes up around 75 percent of the market.Within this segment, accessories and women’s apparel are expected to see faster growth compared to other fashion categories.The BPC segment, while smaller, has gained mainstream popularity, with a penetration rate of approximately 16 percent in 2023.This segment is also expected to grow slightly faster than fashion over the next five years, indicating a rising consumer interest in beauty and personal care products.A significant trend identified in the study is the rise of the trend-first fashion market, driven largely by online platforms.With a vast assortment and quicker product refresh cycles, this trend-first market is expected to grow eightfold, reaching $4–5 billion by 2028.Consequently, the online share of trend-first fashion is projected to increase to 50–55 percent, up from the current 30–35 percent.This shift underscores the growing importance of staying ahead of fashion trends and offering consumers the latest styles.The Evolving Online Shopper\\nIn 2023, more than 175 million consumers across India shopped for lifestyle products online, making an average of 6–7 transactions per year.Interestingly, for 40–45 percent of first-time e-commerce shoppers, lifestyle products were their initial purchase, highlighting the category's role as a gateway to e-retail.These shoppers are increasingly frequenting multiple platforms and completing their purchases in shorter time frames.Deeply entrenched shoppers, defined as those spending over Rs 50,000 annually on a platform, exhibit even more engaged behavior.These shoppers visit their preferred platform at least once a day on average and make over 25 purchases per year, far exceeding the market average.The study also highlights the growing influence of Gen-Z shoppers, who, despite lower spending per order, transact more frequently.This fashion-forward, digitally native demographic accounts for 25 percent of the e-lifestyle market, contributing $4 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV).Notably, new-age insurgent brands have seen twice the adoption rate among Gen-Z consumers, indicating the importance of catering to this segment with affordable, trendy assortments and authentic brand positioning.Opportunities for India’s Manufacturing Sector\\nThe rapid growth of India’s e-lifestyle market has created significant opportunities for the country's manufacturing sector.The study notes an increasing share of India-made products in global brand assortments, driven by enhanced manufacturing capabilities.These include not only cotton textiles but also technical textiles, which are gaining prominence.Brands are working closely with manufacturers to shorten go-to-market (GTM) times, control costs, and enhance agility.The greater role of technology in sourcing is also bolstering India’s position as a fashion-sourcing destination.India has emerged as a key market for top global brands, with 90 percent of the top 50 global brands already present in the country.Half of these brands generate over $30 million in revenue from their India operations, reflecting the confidence in India’s potential as a major lifestyle market.The past year has seen the launch or planned launch of over 60 global brands across various segments, including fashion and beauty.These launches span a range of categories, from scale and niche to luxury and new-age brands.The Role of Online Channels in Brand Expansion\\nThe

consumers have made purchases influenced by AI recommendations, a figure notably higher than the global average of 30 percent.Furthermore, 61 percent of Indian shoppers find AI-driven product suggestions extremely beneficial.Despite this enthusiasm for technology, there remains a clear preference for human interaction.A new report by EY, the Future Consumer Index (FCI), reveals a complex landscape for online shopping in India.The study, which surveyed 1,000 Indian consumers as part of a global poll, highlights a strong preference for human customer service, even as confidence in

& Retailer Media\\nAug 07, 2024 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  A substantial 62 percent of Indian consumers have made purchases influenced by AI recommendations, a figure notably higher than the global average of 30 percent.Furthermore, 61 percent of Indian shoppers find AI-driven product suggestions extremely beneficial.Despite this enthusiasm for technology, there remains a clear preference for human interaction.A new report by EY, the Future Consumer Index (FCI), reveals a complex landscape for online shopping in India.The study, which surveyed 1,000 Indian consumers as part of a global poll, highlights a strong preference for human customer service, even as confidence in artificial intelligence (AI) grows.The findings suggest that while AI-driven product recommendations are valued, concerns over data security and continued demand for human interaction shape the online shopping experience in India.The report underscores that 78 percent of Indian consumers prefer shopping on platforms that offer human customer support, and 61 percent are more comfortable sharing personal information with a person rather than through automated systems.Angshuman Bhattacharya, Partner and National Leader - Consumer Product and Retail Sector at EY Parthenon noted, “Retailers need to adapt to the evolving consumer landscape.While technology and AI play a significant role in shaping purchasing decisions, the human element remains crucial.Consumers increasingly value authentic connections and transparency in data usage.Retailers must balance technological advancements with a personal touch to meet these demands effectively.”Data Security Concerns\\nThe report also highlights significant concerns regarding data security.A substantial 77 percent of Indian consumers are deeply concerned about potential data breaches during online transactions, with 73 percent worried about their personal information being exposed.This apprehension emphasizes the need for retailers to prioritize data protection and maintain transparent practices regarding data usage.Influencer Impact\\nThe influence of social media personalities is another key insight from the report.In India, influencers wield considerable sway, with 81 percent of consumers following at least one social media influencer, blogger, or vlogger.This contrasts sharply with only 45 percent of global respondents who engage with influencers.Indian consumers also tend to find products recommended by influencers highly trustworthy, with 60 percent expressing confidence in such recommendations, compared to just 27 percent globally.Notably, 84 percent of Indian consumers have made purchases based solely on an influencer’s promotion or recommendation.Online Shopping Preferences\\nOnline shopping continues to gain traction in India, with 75 percent of consumers favoring online purchases and only visiting physical stores for exceptional experiences.This preference is significantly higher than the global average of 41 percent.Over the past six months, 51 percent of Indian consumers have downloaded a retail app, compared to 31 percent globally.Discounts and exclusive deals drive this preference, although consumers do face challenges such as receiving damaged goods (21 percent), inadequate customer support (20 percent), and difficulties in processing refunds (19 percent).Balancing Innovation and Authenticity\\nBhattacharya further emphasized, “To truly engage with today’s consumers, brands must cultivate genuine relationships with the influencer community.Selecting influencers who align with brand values and resonate with target audiences is essential for maximizing return on investment.Brands need to carefully manage these collaborations to uphold their image and ensure effective performance monitoring.”The report paints a picture of an Indian market where technology and human interaction coexist, each playing a vital role in shaping consumer behavior.Retailers must navigate this landscape by leveraging AI for its benefits while addressing concerns about data security and maintaining the human touch that consumers value.As online shopping continues to evolve, balancing technological advancements with authentic, personalized service will be key to meeting consumer expectations and driving success in the competitive retail sector.Artificial intelligenceOnline

Checkout Scan, spending on travel has surged by 72 percent, while F&B and services have grown by 60 percent and 57 percent, respectively.This shift in consumer behavior underscores a broader trend: the increasing acceptance and utilization of digital platforms by older generations.The convenience of online services and the simplicity of modern app interfaces have played a crucial role in this transformation.Puneet Singh, CXO-Business at Simpl noted, “The Indian e-commerce industry is witnessing tectonic shifts where customers in the age group of 41-60 years have pipped 18-25 year olds in the growth in online spending via Simpl’s 1-tap Checkout across several categories.These shifts are driven by greater sets of services available online along with customers’ innate behavior to seek affordability and convenience online.”Transaction Frequency and Top Categories\\nThe data indicates that seniors made over 3 million transactions online, marking a 52 percent increase in transaction frequency.The top categories for spending included groceries or quick commerce and F&B, which accounted for one-third of all online spending.Travel expenditures represented 20 percent of their spending, with the remaining transactions spread across services and health and fitness.Notable merchants that benefited from this trend include Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, MakeMyTrip, Ixigo, MyJio, BookMyShow, Apollo 24/7, and Netmeds.This diverse range of platforms highlights the widespread adoption of e-commerce services by older adults, driven by the convenience and comprehensive offerings available online.Average Order Value (AOV) Trends\\nThe increasing adoption of e-commerce services among older adults is also reflected in the rising average order value (AOV) across categories.For instance, the AOV for health and fitness grew by 42 percent to Rs 1,022 from Rs 720.Similarly, the AOV for travel and marketplace categories grew by 38 percent and 35 percent, respectively.Remarkably, the AOV of Boomers and Gen X is 20 percent higher than that of Gen Z, demonstrating the growing trust and usability of internet commerce among seniors.This increase in AOV is indicative of a deeper trust and reliance on e-commerce platforms, as older consumers are more willing to make larger purchases online.This trend bodes well for businesses aiming to capture this burgeoning market segment.Business Implications and Opportunities\\nThe rise of Gen X and Boomers in online spending presents several opportunities for businesses.Understanding the preferences and behaviors of this demographic is crucial for companies looking to tailor their offerings and marketing strategies to capture their attention and loyalty.Enhanced User Experience: Simplifying the online shopping experience is paramount.Older adults appreciate intuitive interfaces and streamlined processes, such as Simpl's 1-Tap Checkout, which reduces the complexity and enhances the convenience of online shopping.Targeted Marketing: Crafting marketing campaigns that resonate with the values and preferences of Gen X and Boomers can drive engagement and conversions.Emphasizing the convenience, affordability, and variety of online services can attract this demographic.Diverse Product Offerings: Expanding product ranges to include items that appeal to older adults, such as health and wellness products, travel services, and premium food and beverages, can help capture a larger share of this market.Building Trust: Establishing and maintaining trust is critical.Providing reliable

READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Concepts such as “ESG” (Environmental Social Governance), “Sustainability”, “Net Zero”, “Triple Bottom Line”, “Circular economy” have transitioned from academia and thinktanks to boardrooms, annual reports, and strategy meetings.This is an explicit acceptance of the fact that enterprises can no longer afford to prioritize financial profitability over environmental costs; the environment is no longer an “externality”.This mindset is reshaping business priorities, growth strategies, and operations due to global climate change and social divisions.Adverse impacts include inadequate rainfall, high temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and severe flight turbulence.Socio-economic inequities also worsen, leading to unrest and migration.Leaders are consciously considering sustainability aspects when making business decisions due to:\\nBusiness decisions based solely on financial gains, ignoring environmental impacts \\nRegulatory changes holding businesses accountable for environmental and social impacts \\nRising stakeholder activism from customers, employees, and business partners against unsustainable actions\\nWith pervasive digitalization and changing globalization, sustainable commerce demands a shift from Milton Friedman’s 1970s famous assertion that a business’s sole responsibility is to maximize shareholder profits.What is the sustainable commerce movement?Sustainable commerce requires businesses to prioritize conserving resources and minimizing environmental damage, even if it leads to lower profits, across all strategic and operational aspects of the value chain.Millennials and GenZers, increasingly comprising employees, customers, influencers, and policy makers, strongly support environmental and social issues.Survey show over three out of four employees would consider companies’ sustainability commitments before accepting job offers.The sustainable commerce paradigm will impact demand, operations, and value chains.Talent attraction and retention will also hinge on sustainability commitments.Leaders must take a comprehensive approach to embracing sustainable commerce.Direct impact on demand\\nCustomers are consciously prioritizing the environment and changing lifestyles.Businesses will see a shift in demand as customers will:\\nDefer upgrades, delaying the purchase of new products.Prefer repairing products over the \\\"use and throw\\\" approach, supported by government regulations.Rent instead of buy \\nBuy “pre-owned” or “refurbished” products for expensive products and promote circular economy.Impact on strategy and operations \\nOrganizations can embrace sustainable commerce by shifting their focus from \\\"innovation\\\" to \\\"ecovation,\\\" creating ecologically sensitive products that meet customer needs.They should embed sustainability in their vision and mission and set ambitious \\\"Net Zero\\\" goals.Manufacturers can proactively adopt the following to align with the sustainable commerce paradigm: \\nProduct Design: Focus on modularity, reducing material consumption, and standardizing components to cut costs and improve durability, safety, and repair expenses, while increasing energy efficiency and adopting regenerative designs like carbon-sequestering materials.Raw Materials: Opt for environmentally friendly materials, such as sodium-ion batteries over lithium-based ones, and increase the use of recycled materials, or using recycled plastic hangers for toner cartridges.Production processes: to reduce energy consumption, pollution, and waste generation.Innovative packaging: to eliminate plastic and ease recycling of waste.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"HpHwoMtTMhbQVbyEwulSx3u1PGj80CIiOOjPGylC+FM=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f0260c65-bf63-4650-a570-ed6b5d3cdca2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f0260c65-bf63-4650-a570-ed6b5d3cdca2\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5e851cea-ec43-4faf-828a-877fc0745add\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"Vr/qTrPvUjJJzwn9xomPvllTgnMkZzyOVEVnsd8RgbQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"4f0a764e-100f-42fa-bea6-fdb2e36543a3\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"qxy8o5A06yKGya3/eB4Ed86B+yzLkf4LubenQyfgFkY=\"}},\"text\":\"Impact

standards, include these criteria in vendor selection, conduct surprise audits, and reward top vendors with preferential terms.Ensure downstream suppliers adhere to the same standards.Greener logistics options: to reduce carbon footprint, such as using trains instead of trucks and waterways for heavy equipment.Greener Reverse Supply Chains: Create safe disposal channels for end-of-life products.Use third parties to buy and recycle used items from consumers.E-commerce companies can adopt this, selling refurbished products to recoup costs.Businesses need AI tools to accurately capture and analyze large data sets from various sources, generating actionable insights.While sustainable commerce is evident in manufacturing, it applies to all sectors, including service providers.Enterprises can implement sustainable practices by using recycled water in data centers, opting for cleaner energy sources like solar panels and biomass, and regularly measuring sustainability progress.Other strategies include considering environmental impacts in problem-solving, repurposing old computers for underprivileged students, making office changes to reduce consumption, fostering employee volunteerism in environmental causes, and focusing Corporate Social Responsibility programs on conservation and recycling.Embracing sustainable commerce is now a business imperative.While actions vary by industry and company, leaders must integrate sustainability into their design thinking when transforming functions and the enterprise.Authored By\\nBindya S

country's dynamic developments in digital payments, primarily driven by the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which saw a 138 percent increase in usage from FY18 to FY24.Digital Payment Penetration in Small Towns\\nThe report also highlights the penetration of digital payments in small towns, where 65 percent of transactions are conducted digitally, compared to 75 percent in larger cities.Cities like Lucknow, Patna, Bhopal, Jaipur, Bhubaneswar, Indore, Ahmedabad, and Pune are close to larger metropolitan cities in terms of digital payment usage, despite having lower retail potential.The study found a strong correlation between a city’s average Degree of Digital Payment Usage (DDPU) and its retail potential, as measured by the Kearney India Retail Index.The top six metros display both high DDPU and high retail potential, indicating a robust digital payment ecosystem.Future Growth Drivers\\nThe next wave of digital payment growth in India is expected to come from lower-income groups and smaller towns.Digital payments make up 69 percent of transaction volumes for over 1,000 surveyed merchants, with even street vendors like paan shops, fruit sellers, and Kirana stores adopting digital payment methods.However, challenges such as financial fraud, limited connectivity, and trust issues remain.India’s digital payment landscape is poised for remarkable growth, driven by widespread adoption and a significant shift in consumer behavior.As digital payments continue to penetrate deeper into smaller towns and among lower-income groups, the country’s digital payment ecosystem is set

Naver, announced its decision to cease operations in India in October 2023, citing intense competition.The company plans to refocus its efforts on core markets such as the United States and Canada.Poshmark’s exit from India underscores the competitive pressures in the market, as global players face challenges in gaining traction against local startups and established e-commerce

compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14-16 percent, whereas \\\"India B and C\\\" had a CAGR of 8-10 percent.Affluent shoppers focused on trendy, fashionable items, while middle-income consumers preferred lower-cost alternatives influenced by past trends or celebrity endorsements.Future Outlook\\nThe future of India's fashion market is promising.Currently valued at around $93 billion, it is expected to grow to approximately $200 billion by 2030.The online fashion sector is particularly poised for significant growth, with forecasts predicting a surge to $36 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) by 2030, driven by an impressive CAGR of 20 percent from 2023 to 2030.Key Trends and Strategies\\nSeveral key trends are likely to shape the next decade in fashion e-commerce:\\nDominance

Platforms for Online Sales Growth\\nBY - Guest author\\nJun 15, 2024 / 12 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The digital age has brought about a paradigm shift in how we shop, interact, and engage with brands.One of the most significant developments in this transformation is social commerce.As social media platforms continue to evolve, they have increasingly integrated e-commerce functionalities, creating a seamless blend of social interaction and online shopping.Social commerce refers to the use of social media platforms to facilitate and enhance the buying and selling of products and services online.This integration allows users to discover, research, and purchase products directly within their favorite social media apps.Businesses may leverage the enormous user populations of social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest to increase sales and foster brand loyalty by fusing the power of social networks with e-commerce.Social commerce influences the inherently social nature of these platforms, where users can share their purchases, leave reviews, and recommend products to their network, creating a community-driven shopping experience.This method goes beyond traditional e-commerce by incorporating elements such as social proof, user-generated content, and real-time engagement, which can significantly influence purchasing decisions.Global and Indian Market Trends\\nThe rise of social commerce is evident from recent statistics and market trends.Globally, social commerce sales are projected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2025, accounting for a significant portion of the e-commerce market.In India, social commerce is rapidly gaining traction, driven by the country's high social media usage and growing e-commerce industry.As per a report by Bain & Company, India's social commerce market is expected to grow to $20 billion by 2025, up from $1.5 billion in 2020.Consumers are increasingly turning to social media platforms for shopping, with platforms like Instagram and Facebook leading the way.Instagram's \\\"Shop\\\" feature and Facebook's \\\"Shops\\\" are prime examples of how these platforms are enhancing their e-commerce capabilities to cater to this growing trend.Additionally, the rise of short-video platforms like TikTok has also contributed to the growth of social commerce, with influencers and content creators playing a pivotal role in driving sales through engaging content.Benefits of Social Commerce\\nEnhanced Customer Engagement\\nOne of the primary benefits of social commerce is enhanced customer engagement.Social media platforms are designed for interaction, making them ideal for brands to connect with their audience.Through posts, stories, live videos, and direct messages, businesses can engage with customers in real time, answer queries, and provide personalized recommendations.This level of interaction builds trust and fosters a sense of community, encouraging repeat purchases and brand loyalty.Seamless Shopping Experience\\nSocial commerce offers a seamless shopping experience by integrating the entire customer journey within a single platform.From product discovery to purchase and post-purchase engagement, everything happens within the social media app.Features like shoppable posts, in-app checkouts, and instant customer support streamline the buying process, reducing friction and making it easier for consumers to complete transactions.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ZfvBxNfzefGOpBFNWhYDWoQXjmOxRVW+RkBt71DLLhY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f48d2e81-738c-4e03-9f4c-d5384ef364c7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f48d2e81-738c-4e03-9f4c-d5384ef364c7\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"4f604d59-8fd3-4826-bb7d-3f6f715a8aab\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"amtHz91mevzdpSdrWjWeBxSSi6Aw2ahwtuuQW1u1RNA=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"3627aa33-6492-4ef9-bfb7-c37cdaa920dc\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"oU13QlrVt8RivdVWt71Qs0+8xPXua2hccFbuvadn+KY=\"}},\"text\":\"Benefits

convenience is particularly appealing to younger, tech-savvy shoppers who value efficiency and instant gratification.Targeted Advertising\\nSocial media platforms are equipped with sophisticated targeting capabilities, allowing businesses to reach their ideal customers with precision.By leveraging data on user behavior, interests, and demographics, brands can create highly targeted ad campaigns that resonate with specific audiences.Granular Measurement and Analysis\\nFinally, using social commerce lets businesses take advantage of granular measurement and analysis capabilities.Companies can track all kinds of data related to their campaigns including engagement rates, click-throughs, conversions, and more.This data is invaluable for fine-tuning existing strategies as well as developing new ones in order to maximize profits.Strategies for Leveraging Social Media Platforms\\nInfluencer Collaborations\\nCollaborating with influencers is a powerful strategy for leveraging social media platforms for social commerce.Influencers have built trust and credibility with their followers, making their recommendations highly influential.By partnering with influencers, brands can tap into their reach and authenticity to promote products in a relatable and engaging manner.Whether through sponsored posts, unboxing videos, or live shopping events, influencer collaborations can drive significant traffic and sales.Interactive Content\\nCreating interactive content is another effective strategy for driving social commerce.Interactive content, such as polls, quizzes, and live videos, encourages user participation and keeps audiences engaged.Live shopping events, in particular, have gained popularity as they allow brands to showcase products in real-time, answer questions, and offer exclusive discounts.This interactive approach not only boosts engagement but also creates a sense of urgency, prompting immediate purchases.Customer Reviews and Testimonials\\nCustomer reviews and testimonials play a crucial role in social commerce by providing social proof and building trust.Encouraging satisfied customers to share their experiences on social media can influence potential buyers and drive sales.Brands can feature user-generated content, such as photos and videos of customers using their products, to add authenticity and credibility.Additionally, responding to reviews and addressing feedback shows that the brand values customer opinions, further enhancing trust and loyalty.Future of Social Commerce\\nEmerging Trends\\nThe future of social commerce is promising, with several emerging trends set to shape the industry.One such trend is the integration of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies.These technologies offer immersive shopping experiences, allowing customers to virtually try on products or visualize them in their environment before making a purchase.This not only enhances the shopping experience but also reduces the likelihood of returns.Another emerging trend is the rise of social commerce on messaging platforms.Apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are increasingly being used for shopping, with businesses setting up virtual storefronts and offering customer support through these channels.This trend is particularly significant in regions with high mobile penetration, such as India and Southeast Asia.Advice for Retailers\\n\\nFor retailers looking to capitalize on the rise of social commerce, it is essential to stay agile and adapt to evolving trends.Investing in social media marketing and building a strong presence on key platforms is crucial.Retailers should also focus on creating high-quality, engaging content that resonates with their target audience.Retailers should also explore innovative technologies, such as AR and VR, to offer unique shopping experiences.Lastly, providing exceptional customer service and actively engaging with customers on social media can foster loyalty and encourage repeat business.Conclusion\\nThe rise of social commerce represents a significant opportunity for businesses to leverage social media

advertising.As the industry continues to evolve, retailers must stay ahead of emerging trends and adopt effective strategies to maximize the potential of social commerce.With the right approach,

influencer like Masoom Minawala to increase awareness for the platform.We also collaborate with macro and mid creators for sale events and mid and nano creators for trending beauty conversations.Influencers are crucial for amplifying our retail stores and participating in launch events.”Asthana further commented, “For influencers, collaborating with platforms offers them the opportunity to be associated with the brand, showcase their creative work, and access the brand's following, aside from monetary compensation.In affiliate programs, influencers create content specifically to sell products, earning a commission on sales.Thus, it’s a mutually beneficial relationship.”View this post on Instagram\\n                      A post shared by Tata CLiQ

consumers, and are experts in their fields, thus helping to drive our brand philosophy in consumers' minds.”He further noted, “Influencers facilitate product discovery through high-quality and

Insights\\nBY - Guest author\\nJun 02, 2024 / 9 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  The vast majority (90 percent) of online retailers say customers’ misuse of return policies and loyalty programs is affecting their bottom line, according to a global study in 2023 by Riskified[1].However, 93 percent of retailers said it is “somewhat important” or “very important” to offer generous refund and return policies to win new customers and retain loyal ones.This leaves Indian retailers selling online with a big dilemma.How do they make returns easy, yet discourage fraudulent activity at the same time?Different Types of Returns Fraud\\n‘Serial returners’ are shoppers who regularly and deliberately buy multiple items and repeatedly returning them.‘Wardrobers’ abuse the system by wearing clothes for one occasion only, then sending them back.More overt scams include claiming that an item that arrived, has never arrived, or that the item does not match the product description, or was damaged in transit.Other fraudulent activities include returning shoplifted items, and ‘merchandise exchange’ whereby shoppers purchase a new item, then return an older or non-working version of the same item, using the packaging from the newer merchandise.Such scams are not solely practiced by individuals.Organized international crime rings are often co-ordinating fraudulent returns activities on a grand scale.Time to Take Action\\nRetailers are pushing back.For instance, in 2019, Asos.com said it would begin deactivating[2] the accounts of serial returners on its site.Some fashion brands, including Zara, J.Crew[3] and Uniqlo[4], have begun charging for returns in order to claw back lost revenue.The key to addressing the scale of these problems is having digital systems in place that will alert retailers and spot which SKUs – and which customers - are problematic.Data analytics of returns patterns is something Asendia can offer clients through the e-PAQ Returns[5] solution.The system provides a full suite of retailer reports and dashboards.The power is in spotting the trends and taking timely action to stamp out returns fraud activity, wherever in the world it is happening.Here are four ways data analytics can assist in the fight against returns fraud:\\nPattern Recognition and Anomaly Detection\\nIt’s possible to process vast amounts of transaction, inventory, and customer data to establish normal shopping patterns and behaviors.By using advanced algorithms, retailers can identify anomalies that might indicate returns fraud.Unusual patterns, such as frequent returns of high-value items, or returns from the same address with different customer names, can be flagged for further investigation.Analysis of the reason for returning can also flag suspicious, repetitive behavior.Customer Data Analysis\\nRetail loss prevention teams can deploy analytics to detect potential networks of fraudsters working together.By examining shared IP addresses, shipping addresses, and payment methods, retailers can uncover hidden associations that might indicate organized fraud rings.Identifying such networks can help retailers take pre-emptive action to prevent fraud.Predictive Modeling for Fraud Prevention\\nRetailers with a costly returns problem can leverage historical data to assess the likelihood of a particular transaction being fraudulent.These predictive models can factor in variables, such as purchase history, device information, and behavioral patterns.Retailers can then set customizable risk thresholds, automatically flagging or blocking transactions that exceed these thresholds, thereby reducing returns fraud.Real-time Monitoring and Alerts\\nImplementing real-time data analytics allows retailers to monitor transactions as they happen.By using machine learning algorithms, retailers can instantly evaluate each purchase for signs of potential fraud.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"OKE/SwNPoUflYTEIPL9xKVIsgC4dtma+tO5zcUHD6AQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a85c0ee0-5bd7-47ca-8175-ca4d9a6ec28a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a85c0ee0-5bd7-47ca-8175-ca4d9a6ec28a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"dd54a804-034f-4054-b8d5-5244e0655a89\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"4BywuutuR8Gmw9N7QmctBvH2CCec3sAufPJu9vDtThE=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"81b4be37-38ba-4d49-a582-a41d97ad7bb1\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"iljy1W+dcFpd3MNXA5/l3TUwQaxhdav7yi5rbfwe/iA=\"}},\"text\":\"Analysis

alerts can be sent to fraud prevention teams for immediate action, such as manual review or order cancellation.Make Your Returns Policy Crystal Clear\\nRetailers can protect themselves against fraud by having a clear and stringent returns policy – and always enforcing it.Requesting that customers send a printout of the receipt when returning items can also help, alongside confirmation of address and zip code information, plus the last 4 digits of the payment card used.Well-established parcel shipping partners, who are increasingly handling returns on behalf of retailers, are in a strong position to help retailers manage reverse logistics.Leveraging Market-Specific Insights\\nAccording to a recent report by Asendia, 76 percent of Indian shoppers would be prepared to pay a nominal fee for returning items.This indicates a receptiveness in the Indian market to levying charges on returns, offering retailers an opportunity to deter unnecessary returns and cover some costs.Data analytics provides retailers with a powerful arsenal against returns fraud by detecting unusual patterns, and enabling informed decision-making.When better-informed, online stores can cut down on returns fraud and make sure honest shoppers feel safe and confident.[1] https://www.riskified.com/lp/policy-abuse-global-benchmarks-report/\\n[2] https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47820387\\n[3]

exponential growth trajectory, with projections indicating a revenue surge to $119.9 billion by 2032, according to a report by Acumen Research.Here are some of the AI trends that are revolutionizing the retail landscape:\\nSustainability Initiatives\\nOne of the most notable trends in the AI in retail market is the growing emphasis on sustainability initiatives.As environmental consciousness becomes a priority for both consumers and businesses, retailers are increasingly leveraging AI to bolster their sustainability efforts.AI-powered analytics play a crucial role in reducing waste, optimizing energy consumption, and streamlining supply chains to minimize environmental impact.Reducing Waste\\nAI enables retailers to predict demand more accurately, thereby reducing overproduction and minimizing waste.By analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and other relevant factors, AI algorithms can forecast future demand with greater precision.This allows retailers to adjust their production schedules accordingly, ensuring that they produce only what is needed.Consequently, this reduces the likelihood of excess inventory and unsold goods ending up in landfills.Optimizing Energy Consumption\\nEnergy consumption is a significant concern for retail businesses, particularly those with large physical stores or distribution centers.AI-powered systems can monitor and analyze energy usage patterns, identifying opportunities for optimization.For example, AI can adjust lighting and HVAC systems based on occupancy levels and weather conditions, leading to substantial energy savings.By reducing energy consumption, retailers can lower their carbon footprint and contribute to environmental sustainability.Streamlining Supply Chains\\nAI-driven logistics solutions are transforming supply chain management by optimizing delivery routes and reducing carbon emissions.AI can analyze traffic patterns, weather conditions, and other variables to determine the most efficient routes for delivery vehicles.This not only reduces fuel consumption but also ensures timely deliveries.Additionally, AI can help retailers manage inventory more effectively, ensuring that products are transported in the most efficient manner, thereby reducing the environmental impact of logistics operations.Enhanced Customer Experiences\\nAI is playing a pivotal role in reshaping customer experiences in the retail sector.Personalized shopping experiences, powered by AI, are becoming the norm, as retailers strive to meet the evolving expectations of their customers.Several AI-driven technologies are enhancing customer service and engagement, making shopping more convenient and enjoyable.Personalized Recommendations\\nAI algorithms analyze customer behavior, preferences, and purchase history to provide tailored recommendations and offers.By understanding individual customer needs and preferences, retailers can offer more relevant products and promotions.This personalized approach not only enhances customer satisfaction but also drives sales and customer loyalty.For instance, online retailers like Amazon use AI to recommend products based on previous purchases and browsing history, creating a more engaging shopping experience.Virtual Assistants and Chatbots\\nVirtual assistants and chatbots, equipped with natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, are revolutionizing customer service.These AI-driven tools can provide instant support, answer queries, and assist customers in making purchasing decisions.Chatbots are available 24/7, ensuring that customers can get help whenever they need it.This improves customer satisfaction and reduces the workload on human customer service representatives, allowing them to focus on more complex issues.Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)\\nAI is also driving the adoption of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies in retail.These immersive technologies offer customers unique shopping experiences that bridge the gap between online and offline retail.For example, AR can allow customers to visualize how furniture will look in their homes before making a purchase.VR can create virtual stores where customers can browse products in a 3D environment.These innovations not only enhance the shopping experience but also increase customer engagement and conversion rates.Operational Efficiency\\nAI technologies are significantly improving operational efficiency in the retail sector.Automation of routine tasks and advanced analytics are enabling retailers to optimize their operations, reduce costs, and enhance productivity.Automation of Routine Tasks\\nAI-powered automation is streamlining various routine tasks such as inventory management, order processing, and customer support.Automated systems can monitor inventory levels in real-time, generate orders when stocks are low, and process transactions quickly and accurately.This reduces the need for manual intervention and minimizes the risk of errors.By automating these tasks, retailers can allocate human resources to more strategic activities that require creativity and

Guest author\\nMay 04, 2024 / 8 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In 2024, India's e-commerce is pivoting towards sustainability due to increasing consumer demand for eco-friendly practices.This shift sees major players adopting greener methods, like carbon-neutral logistics and renewable energy, setting new standards for environmental responsibility in the digital era.The transformation focuses on minimizing the carbon footprint throughout the product life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal.It involves \\\"green supply chain practices\\\" such as transport optimization and minimalistic packaging, ensuring products are eco-friendly and meet consumer demands.Digital transformation, integral to e-commerce growth, introduces the challenge of increased greenhouse gas emissions from energy-intensive computing.Increased compute and GPU intensive GenAI adoption across the customer experience and operations journeys leave a heavy carbon footprint.Research estimates the development of GPT-3 required 1,287 megawatt-hours of electricity, resulting in 502 tons of CO2 emissions—equivalent to the annual emissions from 112 gasoline cars.This is before consumers started using it.Other studies found that the world’s data centers account for 2.5 to 3.7 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, surpassing the aviation industry’s carbon output.Despite using only 0.9 to 1.3 percent of the world's electricity in 2021, their energy demand could rise to 1.86 percent by 2030, with a projected surge in data center power consumption to approximately 4,250 megawatts by 2028, marking a 212X increase from 2023.Sensing this existential crisis, the e-commerce sector is turning towards green data centers, which can mitigate the environmental costs associated with online commerce.Green data centers significantly reduce the carbon footprint of an organization’s digital operations.Most major hyperscale operators (including Microsoft and Google) are either already powering their cloud computing data centers with 100 percent carbon-free energy or have roadmaps to do so by 2030, to achieve net-zero operational carbon emissions with reduced reliance on fossil fuels.Icelandic data centers are gaining popularity, for running on a mix of geothermal and hydroelectric energy.However, energy consumption is not limited to computing alone in large data centers.Green data centers improve energy efficiency by employing advanced cooling technologies such as liquid immersion, direct-to-chip cooling, plan-based cooling, and zero-water cooling and by optimizing server configurations, significantly reducing energy use and heat output.Innovative solutions, such as underwater data centers and free chillers-based cooling technologies are bringing in more efficiency.Collaboration with industry peers and NGOs, alongside certifications from recognized sustainability standards, is key to promoting green data center initiatives, highlighting a commitment to environmental stewardship.As of September 2022, India had over 200 large data centers.India has been striving to go green since 2010, and the CII-IGBC (The Confederation of Indian Industry - Indian Green Building Council) Green Data Center Rating was launched in 2016.Data center operators are being encouraged to use renewable energy like solar and wind power by collaborating with the ministry of Power.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"BrIFRYwcfrTN8Xbalyhw5T/nltCQ069n6GkUbtCaeao=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c2b4ad6d-c03d-4547-a69a-e25917c9b74b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c2b4ad6d-c03d-4547-a69a-e25917c9b74b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"15e320ed-095d-4e05-9a23-1f705d3c525e\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"IVtJ4VFNAzqDa2IMMlzBdQPGcTfcUjwItW5OusmGdv0=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ac512773-8f4e-46bc-a204-affe179d4326\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"SdAmtrBwclZeIG3kLWeUwTdVG9/bPLUIF7HfFWXAE8s=\"}},\"text\":\"However,

lure.The pandemic has permanently shifted a chunk of the retail traffic to the digital channel and charted an evolutionary path like never before.Fuelled by rapid digitization, present-day consumers have access to an on-demand economy where they desire to engage with retailers on a channel of their preference at the click of a button and receive answers to a host of queries ranging from order changes and delivery tracking to complaints and returns.Meeting the expectations of personalized and seamless interactions across channels has raised the stakes for retailers.According to a study by Genesys, 80 percent of consumers will buy more from companies that consistently personalize their interactions, anticipate their needs, and proactively offer solutions.Today, the biggest challenge for retailers is automating smarter, adapting faster, and following through with a curated value proposition that caters to clients.By overcoming these challenges, retailers can build loyalty and retention in the long run.With the rise of e-commerce and digital channels, organizations are witnessing a large influx and increased volume of customer data.This data can provide valuable insights into the consumer psyche if it is tapped meaningfully.However, many retailers are not able to harness the right technology and find it tough to process this large quantity of data to enhance client engagement and loyalty.They inadvertently miss the opportunities that digital promises, such as maintaining seamless experiences, understanding buyer preferences, and expanding client reach.Having a state-of-the-art cloud contact center can provide retailers with strategic insights into the nature of customer queries, behavior, and pain points, which they can harness to carve out strategies and orchestrate meaningful experiences along the entire journey.However, very often internal silos and complex tasks lead to operational challenges in a contact center, which results in negatively

many retailers are not able to harness the right technology and find it tough to process this large quantity of data to enhance client engagement and loyalty.They inadvertently miss the opportunities that digital promises, such as maintaining seamless experiences, understanding buyer preferences, and expanding client reach.Having a state-of-the-art cloud contact center can provide retailers with strategic insights into the nature of customer queries, behavior, and pain points, which they can harness to carve out strategies and orchestrate meaningful experiences along the entire journey.However, very often internal silos and complex tasks lead to operational challenges in a contact center, which results in negatively impacting employee engagement, managing resources, and eventually affecting the bottom line.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning can play a vital role here.By marrying automation and logic, employees can utilize tools to gain productivity and efficiency, which can eventually result in improved experiences and business results for the end user.Forrester Research states that organizations that effectively leverage AI can expect an increase of 5-10 percent in their revenues.They can take advantage of AI in contact centers to adapt to increasing demands and improve overall business performance while also using it to improve quality, consistency, and employee experience.Businesses with the right AI tools can predict, listen, understand, and act in real time, allowing them to remove friction for their workforce and provide more personalized services for their customers.Harnessing AI for Predictive Routing & Personalised Engagement\\nMaximising AI for enhancing employee engagement does not entail just adding the latest application as a magic bullet but building an AI strategy that encompasses data, analytics, and the many applications of AI and machine learning -- routing, scheduling, forecasting, predictions, and more.When these elements come together, they provide compelling business outcomes.Of the various components responsible for the success of a contact center, routing ranks high.Most of the contact centers still use queue-based routing, a technology that was developed more than 40 years ago.However, such traditional routines pose severe bottlenecks when new channels are built.It is challenging to align with new demands and alter business rules as queues in such a routing system are inflexible, siloed, and static.All this leads to a dependency on the IT team, which decreases employee efficiency and delivers a high effort and fragmented experience for customers.To stay competitive, organizations must transition to a predictive routing technology that has the potential to support a larger, omnichannel experience spanning the entire customer journey by harnessing the power of data over time.Here leveraging AI and machine learning,  clients are paired with those agents who are best suited for the customer’s case.Today, predictive engagement is emerging as a powerful tool, enabling organizations to connect with their audience precisely when it matters most.For instance, predictive engagement initiates a proactive chat when a customer abandons their shopping cart.It seamlessly connects the visitor with a dedicated sales representative who can offer guidance through the purchase journey.Lastly, predictive engagement goes above and beyond to ensure that the customer’s resources are dedicated to the most valuable and gratifying inquiries, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience by providing the right level of assistance to the customer.The Future of Retail: Personalised & Automated Engagement Pave the Way\\nAn e-commerce concept known as connected retail which has the potential to go beyond a transactional approach to lend customers a personalised experience across each touchpoint using digital technologies, is gaining recognition.With a customer-centric approach, retailers can address customer expectations across all channels by understanding who they are, where they came from, and what they want to do next.The key lies in leveraging high-quality insights effectively to connect with the audience better for a more empathetic, personalized approach.Insights can be garnered in real-time, to figure out who, when, and how to engage, and based on the outcome prediction retailers can proactively identify their target audience and surface relevant offers to capture upsell opportunities and drive conversions.With AI, retailers can adapt quickly to changing business demands, personalize experiences with consumers, and beat the competition through a showcase of value and increased digital bandwidth.Today’s AI can also be implemented and managed with limited resources.Predictive routing and personalized engagement, powered by AI and machine learning, combine employee performance capabilities with user collaborations in a unique manner to accomplish better client and employee interaction.In these times of flux, it is important for businesses to make the most of the next-generation routing solution and take their retail businesses to the next level of growth by delivering incredible experiences powered by transformative AI technologies.About the Author\\nRaja Laksmipathy, Managing Director of Genesys India\\nA

Indians Demand Zero-Packaging Deliveries!BY - Nandini Banerjee\\nManaging Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nApr 01, 2024 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In the age of convenience-driven consumption, where every click brings a package to your doorstep, the environmental impact of online shopping cannot be overlooked.As the world grapples with sustainability challenges, there's a growing awareness about the excessive packaging accompanying our online purchases.In a recent study commissioned by Amazon, it was revealed that seven out of 10 Indian adults would gladly receive their online orders sans additional delivery packaging, marking a significant shift in consumer attitudes towards eco-conscious practices.The findings come at a time when essential items are increasingly being delivered to Indian doorsteps without the burden of excess packaging.The rationale behind this shift is compelling – more than half of Indian shoppers cited a desire to minimize packaging material consumption as their primary motivation.This aligns with global efforts by Amazon, which has managed to slash outbound packaging weight per shipment by a staggering 41 percent since 2015, eliminating over 2 million tons of packaging material in the process.The company has been pioneering sustainable packaging initiatives in India and globally.By utilizing reusable crates or tote bags to protect eligible items, Amazon has managed to bypass the need for supplementary packaging, leading to lighter shipments and reduced carbon emissions per package.However, not all items are created equal in the eyes of consumers when it comes to packaging preferences.The study identified certain product categories, such as clothing apparel, detergent, and stationery, where customers are content to receive items in their original packaging with just an address label added.On the other hand, discreet packaging remains crucial for sensitive products like contraceptive devices and medical supplies.Abhinav Singh, Vice President of Operations at Amazon India, emphasized the company's commitment to sustainable practices, stating, \\\"“Like us, our customers really care about reducing packaging, and we’ve made significant progress doing so for years,” said Abhinav Singh, Vice President- Operations, Amazon India.“That said, we aren’t satisfied with continued reduction.Where possible, we want to eliminate packaging altogether.“One way we do this is by working with manufacturers to design packaging that’s capable of shipping safely, without additional paper bags, envelopes or boxes from us.We’ve already achieved a lot, increasing the number of orders shipped to customers with no added delivery packaging in India by 83 percent since 2021.We are working to ship even more deliveries the same way.”To assuage concerns regarding product safety, the subjects selected items to rigorous drop tests, ensuring they reach customers unscathed.Leveraging machine learning algorithms, Amazon evaluates the durability of manufacturer packaging, customizing shipping solutions based on distance traveled and product fragility.While tech accessories, homeware, and shoes are often shipped with minimal packaging, items requiring extra protection, such as liquids and fragile goods, still warrant additional packaging.Despite the transition towards reduced packaging, customer confidence remains paramount.The study found that one in three respondents felt reassured by the refund or replacement policy for missing items, underscoring the importance of trust in driving sustainable shopping practices.In tandem with its packaging reduction initiatives, Amazon has positioned itself as a leader in environmental stewardship through initiatives like The Climate Pledge.By committing to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040 and transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy across its operations by 2025, Amazon is setting a precedent for corporate sustainability efforts worldwide.As consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions, the shift towards minimal packaging in online shopping represents a pivotal moment in the retail landscape.With Amazon spearheading these efforts, there's hope that other industry players will follow suit, ushering in a future where convenience and environmental responsibility go hand in hand.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"wf8kirll1Y9VwjPPA83jXphs2rLb/YsFU5D7rdOLkjI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3010651d-861f-4606-9124-00565eecffa0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3010651d-861f-4606-9124-00565eecffa0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"e39b7cb8-96a6-429c-b6ae-328c8a516dfe\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"rDwxQ/OfmN6WBvuIKZHWuTHQG+2gERJnqnBrMqOiS88=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"5c257d8c-ccd8-49bf-af54-e1971cc042fe\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"MVH9uWzj4OMS1xmdzMZNtuPCjm/4whsXdk1jAD0Njuo=\"}},\"text\":\"Despite

Super Apps Can Deliver Great CX with Observability\\nBY - Guest author\\nMar 28, 2024 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Savvy Indian retailers are capitalizing on growing app fatigue to deliver an all-inclusive digital experience to consumers through super apps.The rise of super apps in India like PhonePe and Tata Neu is evidence of the growing customer preference for these all-in-one applications that combine multiple digital services into one single platform.However, the profitability of super apps relies not only on convenience but also on providing excellent digital experiences to customers.According to the New Relic State of E-commerce in India report, Indian customers had potential concerns with super apps that were related to bandwidth and storage, including the need for 4G/5G internet capabilities (45 percent), and a lot of storage space on devices (42 percent).Despite strong interest in the segment, reliability is still a key concern for many Indians and represents a hurdle to adoption.Scaling confidently without compromising user experience\\nAs super apps add new integrations and scale their user and revenue base, their tech stack naturally becomes more complex, making it hard to pinpoint and resolve issues when they arise.These apps serve millions of customers so any disruptions or downtime will result in significant revenue losses and potential customer churn.In India, 59 percent of customers cited poor user experience as one of the major reasons for uninstalling an app.The potential for super apps to fail is multifold: high traffic volumes, poor third-party integrations, the lack of adequate monitoring, troubleshooting, and blindspots in the IT environment to name a few.While the reasons are numerous, every time the app crashes, the brand loses face in front of its customers, risking customer attrition, and potential revenue for its business and integrated partners.Irrespective of whether an outage occurs due to problems within the application, the cloud it runs on, or even the customer’s internet connectivity,  the brand will often take the hit for a compromised digital user experience.It’s perhaps why one in three customers will leave a brand behind when encountering a poor experience.Scaling confidently requires super apps to deliver a seamless user experience.Full-stack observability helps to solve these problems by giving engineering and technology teams actionable insights into business-impacting issues, ensuring optimal application performance at all times.It also helps to pinpoint any issues with ISPs, SaaS apps, DNS, or third-party providers so engineering teams can find and fix issues proactively and minimize any impact on the customer experience.Creating frictionless transition between services\\nThe key to super app success lies in ensuring smooth transitions between different services.Eliminating each step that creates friction increases the activation rate, ultimately offering super apps a competitive edge.Another strength of super apps is the ability to analyze large volumes of data to learn user behaviors that help to customize the experience.However, making sense of vast amounts of data can be challenging without the right tooling.Globally, data scientists spend nearly 40% of their time cleaning and organizing data.Teams get bogged down by silos, where data from individual tools inevitably ends up on multi-tabbed spreadsheets, losing crucial context and insight.The same goes for engineers.For them to be more proactive in improving app reliability, they must be able to make sense of their telemetry data so they can pinpoint its impact on business outcomes.This level of contextualization helps super apps to expand and grow with confidence, but can only be achieved with observability.Full-stack observability platforms are designed to identify patterns proactively as they provide full visibility into applications, storage, services, and networks, ensuring that engineering teams have in-depth visibility into the behavior, performance, and health of the app.The success of super apps are reliant on this level of insight.Without observability, engineering teams run the risk of blind spots that can impact the customer experience, and businesses risk losing those customers to the competition.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"lq2UOWw8v3pAfo4tOcC4gjtOS1tlyjKAnCpEkTSWFME=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2c8da9a5-9cab-4c39-ab35-a0853c8262db":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2c8da9a5-9cab-4c39-ab35-a0853c8262db\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5c257d8c-ccd8-49bf-af54-e1971cc042fe\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"MVH9uWzj4OMS1xmdzMZNtuPCjm/4whsXdk1jAD0Njuo=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ef0a68c7-bb8b-405b-a03b-5bec0a740cf1\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"evaheiouwJM+hP+fPNx/yd/W1ByqxLomIkAe599xqUg=\"}},\"text\":\"Globally,

revolutionized the way businesses operate around the world, including the fashion retail industry in India.Over the past decade, the growing prominence of E-commerce platforms has drastically transformed the landscape of the Indian fashion retail sector.To understand the role of E-commerce in the Indian fashion retail industry, we must first delve into its historical context.E-commerce in India was relatively nascent until the early 2000s when the internet began gaining widespread popularity.In 2007, the launch of Flipkart, an online marketplace, marked a turning point for E-commerce in India.Flipkart provided a platform for retailers to sell their products online, fueling the growth of E-commerce in the country.This was followed by the entry of other prominent players such as Amazon and Snapdeal, further accelerating the adoption of online shopping among Indian consumers.In the vast fashion landscape, MYNTRA and AJIO have played a crucial role in curating and personalizing the shopping experience for their customers.These platforms employ big data analysis and machine learning algorithms to understand individual preferences and provide tailored recommendations.By employing advanced technologies, MYNTRA and AJIO have revolutionized how consumers discover and choose fashion, rendering each shopping experience highly personalized.E-commerce platforms have also played a significant role in bridging the gap between fashion designers and consumers.In the past, small-scale designers struggled to find a market for their creations due to their limited reach.However, E-commerce has provided them with a global platform to showcase their designs and sell directly to consumers, eliminating the need for intermediaries.This has given rise to a thriving ecosystem of independent designers who can now compete with established fashion brands.As a result, the Indian fashion retail industry has become more diverse and inclusive, fostering creativity and innovation.Several influential individuals have contributed to the field of E-commerce in the Indian fashion retail industry.Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, the founders of Flipkart, were pioneers in introducing E-commerce to the Indian market.Their entrepreneurial spirit and vision revolutionized the way Indians shop for fashion.Similarly, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, played a crucial role in popularising E-commerce in India through the launch of Amazon India, which became a major player in the fashion retail sector.Despite the numerous benefits, the role of E-commerce in the Indian fashion retail industry also presents challenges.One of the main concerns is the impact on traditional brick-and-mortar stores.Many small retailers have struggled to compete with the convenience and affordability offered by online platforms.This has led to several store closures and job losses, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas where E-commerce penetration is high.Additionally, counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers pose a significant threat to the credibility of e-commerce platforms, undermining consumer trust.However, the future of E-commerce in the Indian fashion retail industry looks promising.The rapid growth of internet penetration, especially through smartphones, has fueled the adoption of E-commerce among a large section of the population.This presents an enormous opportunity for players in the industry to tap into the potential of a vast consumer base.Moreover, the advancements in technology, such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality, hold the potential to enhance the online shopping experience, making it more personalized and immersive.In conclusion, the role of E-commerce in the Indian fashion retail industry has reshaped the way business is conducted and revolutionized consumer shopping habits.The historical context, key figures, and impact we have discussed shed light on the transformative power of E-commerce in this sector.While there are both positive and negative aspects to consider, the future looks promising as E-commerce continues to evolve and adapt to the changing needs and expectations of Indian consumers.The role of influential individuals and potential developments highlight the potential for continued growth and innovation in the Indian fashion retail industry through E-commerce.Authored

In a dynamic landscape where consumer habits evolve rapidly, the retail industry finds itself at a significant turning point.This transformation is fueled by the convergence of technological innovation and shifting economic dynamics.By the year 2025, it is anticipated that 20 percent of the top global retailers will leverage distributed AI systems to achieve holistic results, revolutionizing various facets of their operations including sales, marketing, supply chains, and overall business operations.Furthermore, approximately 45 percent of marketing leaders plan to invest in GenAI within the next 12-24 months, underlining the growing importance of AI in driving business strategies.The recent joint report titled “Future of Retail: Profitable Growth through Technology and AI,” presented by Deloitte and the Retailers Association of India (RAI) at the Retail Leadership Summit 2024, sheds light on the pivotal role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in reshaping India’s consumer retail landscape.The report predicts a paradigm shift wherein AI transitions from being a mere tool to becoming the bedrock of profitable growth for retailers.The digital revolution has catalyzed the evolution of retail into ‘phygital’ or omnichannel experiences, disrupting traditional models and prompting brands to harness technology to enhance customer experiences and drive greater return on investment (ROI).Anand Ramanathan, Consumer Products and Retail Sector Leader at Deloitte India emphasizes the pivotal role of technology in this transformation.He asserts that technology is no longer just a tool but an essential foundation upon which retailers must build to meet the expectations of modern consumers and ensure the success of their investments.AI, in particular, is heralded as a game-changer in retail, offering personalized recommendations and solutions, with 71 percent of consumers expecting tailored experiences.This signifies a shift towards experiential engagement beyond mere transactions across various consumer touchpoints.Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of the Retailers Association of India (RAI), underscores the significance of embracing the digital revolution in India’s retail sector.He highlights the indispensable role of technologies such as AI and IoT (Internet of Things) as the building blocks for future-proofing the retail industry.Rajagopalan contends that these innovations are not fleeting trends but rather fundamental elements that will shape the future of retail.The insights gleaned from the report not only demonstrate the transformative power of emerging technologies but also provide a roadmap for retailers to navigate this new era successfully.With India’s burgeoning economy empowering consumers with increased purchasing power and choice, forward-thinking retailers must prioritize crafting superior shopping experiences.Technologies such as AI, IoT, mixed reality, and advanced analytics offer immense potential to streamline operations, personalize experiences, and redefine the essence of shopping itself.Key Trends Driving Emerging Retail Technologies\\nPersonalization and Customer

transforming the world through Artificial Intelligence and technology enablement.He discussed Microsoft's commitment to India, not only in training Indian talent but also in leveraging it.On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had praised the Tech Entrepreneurs Association of Mumbai (TEAM) for hosting Mumbai Tech Week and their ongoing involvement in building tech startups in the country.During a panel discussion with Haptik CEO Aakrit Vaish at Mumbai Tech Week, Puneet Chandok, President of Microsoft India and South Asia, emphasized the transformative impact AI could have on various aspects of daily life.Chandok stated, “When we look at India through the lens of demand, supply, and impact, there is no other market like India today.There are 7,000 listed companies in India and one hundred thousand startups.Many startups are in Maharashtra, and one hundred new startups are emerging in India every day.India is the largest SMB market globally, making it one of the most exciting markets today.”He further added, “When we look at the supply lens and examine Microsoft's data, one out of four projects on AI in GitHub today is run out of India.Every sixth AI researcher in the world is from India.In the next ten years, 25 percent of the global workforce will come from India, meaning every fourth worker in the world will be from India.”Discussing the growing influence and power of Artificial Intelligence, Chandok mentioned, “Last night, my 12-year-old daughter was creating text-to-video, and she told me that AI will change her life.She is an artist; she draws and paints.This also indicates how the younger generation perceives AI.”Expanding on this, Chandok continued, “People will stop searching and instead have conversations.I have stopped searching myself; in fact, I was

Maharashtra is the startup capital while Pune is the tech capital of the country.Fadnavis also mentioned that the Maharashtra government is in active talks with 2-3 global tech giants to help them establish their tech operations in Maharashtra.Devendra Fadnavis, Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, launched Mumbai Megapolis Metaverse during Mumbai Tech Week organized by Tech Entrepreneurs Association of Mumbai (TEAM).During the Fireside Chat with Rishi Darda, Joint MD and ED of Lokmat Media Group, remarked, “I must tell you that when we talk about the startup ecosystem, Bengaluru and Hyderabad are boasted as good startup ecosystems, but let me tell you that the actual reality, as per the numbers, is that Maharashtra is the startup capital.”Fadnavis said, “The highest number of startups which are functional (those that have not moved to Bengaluru) are in Maharashtra, and the highest number of Unicorns, out of all the registered startups in India, are in Maharashtra, while 25 percent of the Unicorns are also housed in Maharashtra.Ultimately, the future of the startup ecosystem is Artificial Intelligence and technology, and now with the capacity of Data Center that we have created.I think that the entire future belongs to Mumbai.”Elaborating on the issue of affordability of living in Mumbai, Fadnavis said, “Mumbai had become unaffordable for many, and that is why people shifted to other cities.But now, we are making Mumbai affordable.Once Mumbai becomes affordable, it will be the city of dreams.One should note that nobody wants to move out of Mumbai and in fact, people want to come to Mumbai.”Talking about future plans for the tech startups in Maharashtra, Fadnavis said, “We have planned something very big with TEAM for the tech and Startup industry.TEAM really represents Mumbai and this will bring back Mumbai to its true position.Maharashtra was the first state in 2016 in which we came up with the startup policy and startup fund.We are now pushing to create a new startup policy to make the ecosystem much more effective and make it most attractive in the country.The future of startups belongs to Maharashtra.”It was in 2023, Google began

office worldwide after the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, California.Talking about the big tech companies investing in other states rather than in Maharashtra, Fadnavis said, “I must tell you that the biggest investment in data centers is being made in Maharashtra.Recently, we went to Pune and entered into an MoU with Google, the search engine giant, to utilize artificial intelligence for agriculture, healthcare, and education solutions.”He elaborated further and said, “The country head of Google told me that we will pitch Pune as the tech city.So today, not just Mumbai, Pune is the tech capital.In fact, many times Pune is overshadowed by Mumbai.But every tech company is present in Pune.Not only Pune but they are present in Nagpur and other Tier II cities as well.”Discussing the role of government in bringing tech companies to the state, Fadnavis said, “As a government, we are in active talks with tech giants to offer them good facilities.They do not require anything from the government, but they just require good governance, which of course, we are committed to giving.There are 2-3 very big tech companies coming to Maharashtra soon.”MaharashtrabengaluruGoogleMumbai\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nFrom Likes to Profits: How Indian Entrepreneurs are Mastering Social Media Sales Strategies\\nBY - Guest author\\nFeb

era.Microsoft commenced 2024 with a groundbreaking move, launching the professional version of its AI chatbot, Copilot.Boasting capabilities such as custom GPTs and seamless Office integration, this innovation positions Microsoft at the forefront of AI advancements.The impact of Microsoft's AI tools on the company's performance is evident, with an impressive 18% year-on-year revenue surge, exceeding $60 billion from September to December.Satya Nadella, Microsoft's Chairman and CEO, emphasized the shift from theoretical discussions on AI to its widespread application across their tech stack.Nadella said, \\\"We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we’re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.”At the heart of Microsoft's commitment to AI integration is a comprehensive approach, infusing AI across all layers of technology to win new customers and drive

Transformation and Information Officer, Shoppers Stop, emphasized AI's multifaceted impact on organizations.From suggesting tailored products for consumers to enabling trend predictions by Gen AI, Babbal stressed that embracing AI is not just a trend but a necessity for survival in the ever-changing business landscape.Jabbal said, “Today trend predictions by Gen AI is helping brands tremendously, making it easier for brands to strategize its product designs and promotional strategies.Embracing AI will be the buzz word and a company who doesn’t work with AI will not survive for long.People have to be ready and adapt the change.\\\"Jabbal dispelled concerns about job displacement, asserting that AI will catalyze transformative changes led by big tech companies rather than replace human roles.As retail brands increasingly recognize the power of AI, its responsible and strategic integration emerges as a key driver for future success.retail IndiaArtificial

Delivery\\nBY - Guest author\\nJan 30, 2024 / 7 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, last-mile delivery has developed into a crucial battleground for those looking to satisfy customer expectations.Precise, timely, and error-free deliveries can lead to satisfied customers, while delays or mistakes can result in dissatisfaction.As the e-commerce landscape evolves, the integration of automation and robotics emerges as a transformative solution to overcome the challenges associated with last-mile logistics.Automation is at the forefront of this transformative shift and is actively developing solutions to redefine last-mile logistics and enhance efficiency.Efficiency in last-mile logistics begins within distribution centers and warehouses.Robotic arms, conveyor systems, and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are increasingly deployed to enhance order fulfilment speed.The use of robots in Indian warehouses is on the rise, recognizing their potential to improve operational efficiency.However, careful consideration of factors like existing infrastructure and workforce adaptability is crucial for successful integration.Drones and other last-mile delivery technologies, such as autonomous delivery systems, enroute manufacturing, robotic stores on wheels, and delivery lockers, are emerging as promising solutions for the future of e-commerce.These innovative solutions are part of the vision for the future of e-commerce.Combined with the expertise, these can revolutionize delivery processes, making them faster, more cost-effective, and more reliable.Major e-commerce retailers continue to innovate, pushing for fast delivery options.Consumer expectations for convenience, speed, and affordability have risen, placing substantial pressure on retailers' bottom lines.Shorter delivery times have become a determining factor for online shoppers, influencing purchasing decisions.The rise of automation has revolutionized

integrating automation technologies promises transformative benefits, it has challenges.The substantial initial investment, regulatory hurdles, safety concerns, and the essential role of human involvement in handling exceptions and customer interactions must be considered.The last mile is among the most expensive and challenging parts of the delivery process.The perennial debate on whether customers are willing to pay for deliveries and returns has led companies to seek ways to optimize, automate, and reduce the cost of last-mile delivery.Challenges like training and retaining last-mile delivery executives are addressed through automation, reducing dependency and minimizing errors.Last-mile delivery automation is the final piece of the puzzle in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce.Whoever successfully solves this puzzle stands to gain the greatest advantage.While challenges exist, the integration of automation and robotics holds the key to shaping the future of last-mile delivery, offering businesses the opportunity to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and meet the ever-growing expectations of online shoppers.The journey toward an automated last mile is not

shopping, the traditional dominance of metros and Tier I cities is undergoing a transformation.While comprising only 14 percent of the total population, these urban centers command a significant 43 percent share of online shoppers, according to a recent report by Alliance Bernstein.However, as the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, growth patterns are experiencing a notable shift.As we navigate the post-COVID era, the dynamics of online shopping are undergoing a profound transformation.The expansion into Tier II and beyond, the normalization of growth patterns, and the influence of seasonal trends underscore the resilience and adaptability of the online market.The evolving landscape presents both challenges and opportunities, making it imperative for internet companies to stay agile and responsive to ever-changing consumer behaviors.Changing Trends\\nThe overall monthly shopper base (MTUs) has surged, constituting 31 percent of Active User Base (ATUs), a considerable leap from the pre-COVID figure of 23 percent.This signals a maturation of the online user base, with an evident rise in the frequency of online shopping activities.Concurrently, internet companies are strategically expanding their supply chains into Tier II and beyond, capitalizing on improving consumer bases and ordering metrics in these cities.Post-COVID Normalization of

Trends\\nThe overall monthly shopper base (MTUs) has surged, constituting 31 percent of Active User Base (ATUs), a considerable leap from the pre-COVID figure of 23 percent.This signals a maturation of the online user base, with an evident rise in the frequency of online shopping activities.Concurrently, internet companies are strategically expanding their supply chains into Tier II and beyond, capitalizing on improving consumer bases and ordering metrics in these cities.Post-COVID Normalization of Growth\\nAcross various internet sub-segments, user growth is gradually normalizing after the initial COVID-induced traction.Particularly, in severely under-penetrated markets like grocery delivery, which accounted for less than 1 percent of total grocery retail spend, there was a remarkable surge in active user base, peaking at an impressive 228 percent YoY growth in July 2022.Meanwhile, slightly mature sectors such as E-Commerce and Fashion continue to witness sustained growth rates, fueled by increased competition from a plethora of Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) platforms.OTT's Uptick\\nThe Over-The-Top (OTT) segment experienced an uptick towards the end of the year, showcasing a 10 percent increase in Monthly Active Users (MAUs) in July-23, which escalated to an impressive 55 percent increase in MAUs by November-23.This surge was attributed to the broadcast of World Cup screenings, especially in cricket (ICC World Cup, T20) and football (FIFA World Cup).Noteworthy gainers in this arena were Jio Cinema and Disney+Hotstar, boasting exclusive broadcasting rights.Seasonality Trends\\nThree sectors have emerged as notable examples of strong seasonality trends.Firstly, in the realm of E-Commerce, the festive season in October drives the highest uptick in active user base, culminating in end-of-year sales across various categories.Secondly, Fashion Commerce, particularly apparel-led firms, experiences two festive seasons each year, with Q1 and Q3 being the strongest quarters, propelling user growth through end-of-season sales.Lastly, Digital OTT's key growth driver lies in sports content viewership, primarily cricket and football, with platforms like Jio Cinema and Disney+Hotstar securing exclusive broadcasting rights.Online ShoppingeCommerce TrendsE-commerce industry\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nGen AI Takes Center Stage: 71 pc

Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nThe Phygital Edge: Cohesive Online and Offline Engagement to Skyrocket Customer Satisfaction\\nBY - Guest author\\nJan 17, 2024 / 8 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Even though online shopping has become a staple choice for Indian consumers, physical stores are still popular destinations.Little wonder, then, that a digitally enabled physical space (with the best of both worlds) holds all the aces today in customer engagement.Take, for instance, the sports gear brand Decathlon, which provides hassle-fee shopping with a phygital approach.With features like scan and go, a virtual reality zone, and a welcome zone at its store, Decathlon has seamlessly fused its physical stores with online buying experiences.This shift isn’t just limited to popular apparel retailers and extends to the D2C stratosphere.Changing the face of the Kirana ecosystem are marquee players like Reliance Retail and D-Mart.Reliance has enhanced its D2C offerings with JioMart, and D-Mart has launched D-Mart Ready, the new formats that seamlessly combine physical retailing with online shopping.Why the Shift to Phygital Engagement\\nBecause the Indian customers say so!Indians actively seek brands that go above and beyond after that first purchase.Consider a scenario where brand A, a show retailer, sells a pair of Oxfords to a customer, takes their money, and ends the interaction with a “Thank you for your order” email with the shipping details.Now imagine another shoe retailer, brand B, follows the same path but doesn’t end the interaction at the shipping details email.Brand B reaches out to the customer with relevant shoe recommendations of Brogues (a formal-wear shoe) on WhatsApp, aligned with the customer’s interest in Oxfords (also a formal-wear shoe).The customer mentioned above gets relevant coupon codes in their email and priority notifications for sales, referral codes, etc. There is no need to specify which of the two brands secures a loyal customer just from that single transaction.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"4H3nm2mDyr5gpcivbSE0Nsde9POPi6K5ZyAztWxYEOo=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"20c0764f-ed2d-4adc-b0bf-c2a6a3cd0c68":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"20c0764f-ed2d-4adc-b0bf-c2a6a3cd0c68\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"c6070f2a-57c4-4f39-aca8-fc91f8a33bb1\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"EmkZQFiQvYLYdCCO9DWdphYxel62irsjcIOb7AGL+8c=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"0bcdcbee-b9e7-414d-bacc-5cfca62df5b9\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"qaVr/l7ygVi0BlEt1vYQ9WqYEDCOfddXhTgdKpa/XTk=\"}},\"text\":\"Why

referral codes, etc. There is no need to specify which of the two brands secures a loyal customer just from that single transaction.The bottom line is that customers expect consistent engagement across all channels.In fact, siloed messaging across channels is one of the primary reasons for negative customer experiences.The findings from a recent study on the personalization pulse of Indian consumers corroborate this sentiment.A significant proportion of consumers surveyed (40.5 percent) said they interact with a brand across 2-3 channels before making a purchase.Therefore, brands that respond with a cohesive customer experience that is consistent and seamless across various channels to meet the diverse preferences of their customers will stay ahead of the game.So, What’s the Hold-up?While the perks of having an omnichannel/phygital customer engagement strategy are numerous, a couple of issues hamper adopting this approach for the better.● Data silos are one of the biggest barriers brands face while adopting an omnichannel strategy.When confronted with isolated and unconnected data, brands have to look into manually merging segmented data gathered from different channels and sources.Naturally, the entire process becomes quite expensive and time-consuming.● Conversations across all channels must be consistent and aligned completely.It is frustrating for the customers if the brand engages with them through contradictory communication.Channels have to collaborate their data in real-time to offer seamless omnichannel experiences.Choosing the Right Engagement Partner to Ensure Maximum ROI\\nThe cornerstone of a successful omnichannel approach is building strong customer relationships through personalized and highly satisfactory shopping experiences.Over time, the direct results are increased average order values (AOV) and higher retention rates.However, as mentioned before, creating consistent customer experiences across channels takes time and effort.To overcome these challenges, brands should invest in an insights-led customer engagement platform (or CEP).Why?Well, such an AI-powered platform can:\\nHelp brands garner deep-level insights like what the most-used channels are by their customers\\nMap entire customer journeys\\nIdentify gaps between channels that are causing friction in the customers’ experiences\\nCreate a unified engagement strategy across channels that gets optimized in real-time.Furthermore, a well-equipped CEP helps optimize costs (a one-stop solution to say goodbye to multiple tools and channel providers) and increases operational efficiency significantly (through AI-powered functionalities, reducing the manual effort required to orchestrate campaigns).An integrated omnichannel/phygital strategy can solidify a brand’s footing in the customers’ hearts, ergo, keeps them coming back for more.It all boils down to who the brand’s trusted engagement partner is and how they utilize the platform.As rightfully quoted by Sean Gerety, “The technology you use impresses no one.The experience you create with it is everything.”Author: Raviteja Dodda, CEO &

2028\\nBY - Vaishnavi Gupta\\nAssistant Editor, IndianRetailer.com & Retailer Media\\nJan 10, 2024 / 5 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In a recent collaborative report by Bain & Company and Flipkart, the e-retail market in India is projected to witness a remarkable surge, surpassing the $160 billion mark by 2028.The study highlights key factors contributing to this growth, such as affordable data, enhanced logistics and fintech infrastructure, and robust digital consumer ecosystems.Current Scenario and Growth Projections\\nAs of 2023, the Indian e-retail market is expected to range between $57-60 billion, with an annual shopper base of approximately 240 million.This represents an annual addition of $8-12 billion since 2020.Despite this substantial growth, online spending in India constitutes only 5-6 percent of total retail spending, indicating vast potential for expansion.In comparison, the United States and China boast online spending percentages of 23-24 percent and 35 percent, respectively.The report anticipates a rebound in the market, with growth levels reaching 23-25 percent in the coming years.By 2028, the e-retail market is poised to surpass $160 billion, showcasing massive headroom for growth.Driving Factors and Opportunities\\nThe report underscores the enduring fundamentals of India's e-retail industry, including factors such as affordable data, improved logistics, and a thriving fintech infrastructure.With 94-95 percent of retail spending still happening offline, there is immense scope for the e-retail sector to capture a larger share of the market as GDP per capita increases, particularly beyond the $4,000 mark.Currently, the per capita income in India stands at around $2,600, and as this figure rises, there is an expected surge in online spending, particularly on discretionary products.The report suggests that the majority of internet users in India, over 60 percent, are yet to embrace online shopping, highlighting the untapped potential within the market.Expanding Seller Ecosystem\\nThe seller ecosystem in India is rapidly expanding, with twice as many sellers added in 2022 compared to the previous year.Notably, around two-thirds of these new sellers originate from Tier II and smaller cities, indicating a democratization of the e-retail landscape beyond metropolitan areas.More than half of the total seller base is concentrated in seven major cities, including Delhi NCR, Surat, Jaipur, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Kolkata.Emergence of New Business Models\\nThe e-retail industry in India is witnessing the emergence of innovative business models to cater to evolving consumer needs.These include Quick Commerce (Q-commerce) platforms, Hyper-Value Commerce, Inspiration-Led Commerce (Live Commerce), and Fast Fashion.Q-commerce, in particular, has experienced significant growth, with orders doubling over the past year and accounting for a substantial portion (40-50 percent) of India's e-grocery spending.The Hyper-Value sector has also witnessed substantial growth, with its share of overall e-retail expanding five times between 2020 and 2022.In conclusion, the e-retail landscape in India is poised for significant growth, driven by factors such as affordable data, improved logistics, and a flourishing digital ecosystem.The projections of the market surpassing $160 billion by 2028

In the dynamic landscape of today's business environment, effective supply chain management is a critical determinant of success.As Indian businesses strive for operational excellence, Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) emerges as a strategic solution to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and elevate supply chain performance.In this innovative model, the supplier assumes a more proactive role, engaging in continuous monitoring of inventory levels, forecasting demand trends, and autonomously replenishing stock as needed.The primary goal of VMI is to create a seamless and efficient inventory management process that benefits both the supplier and the buyer.This method goes beyond the traditional buyer-initiated replenishment process, introducing a more dynamic and synchronized relationship between the two parties.Key Components of Vendor-Managed Inventory\\nReal-Time Visibility: Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) offers real-time visibility into inventory levels, providing businesses with accurate data for informed decision-making.Leveraging advanced technologies such as IoT and RFID, VMI ensures that inventory data is continually updated, thereby minimizing the risks associated with stockouts or overstock situations.Demand Forecasting: A key strength of VMI is its capacity to accurately forecast demand.Utilizing data analytics and analyzing historical consumption patterns, suppliers can anticipate future requirements, reducing the likelihood of stock imbalances and optimizing inventory management.Automated Replenishment: VMI streamlines the replenishment process by introducing automation.This feature enables suppliers to proactively restock inventory levels, reducing the need for manual intervention.The automated replenishment not only enhances efficiency but also ensures timely deliveries, minimizing disruptions in the supply chain.Trends Shaping the Adoption of VMI\\nTechnology Integration: The integration of cutting-edge technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, is increasingly prevalent in VMI systems.These technologies play a pivotal role in enhancing predictive analytics, providing businesses with more accurate demand forecasts and ultimately contributing to more efficient inventory management.Collaborative Partnerships: Indian businesses are increasingly recognizing the significance of establishing strong collaborative partnerships with their suppliers.These relationships are built on principles of transparency, trust, and a shared commitment to operational efficiency.By fostering these collaborative ties, businesses aim to create a more integrated and responsive supply chain.Multi-Location VMI Models: A notable trend in India is the proliferation of multi-location VMI models.This approach allows businesses to synchronize inventory management across various locations, thereby optimizing the supply chain on a broader scale.The adoption of multi-location VMI models reflects a strategic effort to enhance coordination and efficiency in managing inventory across diverse geographical areas.The Impact of VMI\\nImproved Efficiency and Cost Savings: VMI significantly improves operational efficiency and generates substantial cost savings by automating inventory management processes.The reduction in manual intervention streamlines operations, enabling businesses to optimize order quantities, minimize carrying costs, and achieve overall cost-effectiveness in their supply chain.Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: The implementation of VMI ensures a consistent and reliable supply of products, allowing businesses to meet customer demands promptly.This reliability positively impacts customer satisfaction and fosters loyalty, as customers can rely on businesses to consistently deliver the products they need.Risk Mitigation: VMI plays a crucial role in mitigating risks associated with stockouts or excess inventory.The system's emphasis on accurate demand forecasting and timely replenishments equips businesses to navigate uncertainties and disruptions in the supply chain effectively.This risk mitigation aspect contributes to the overall resilience and stability of Indian businesses adopting VMI practices.In the intricate landscape of contemporary supply chain management, Vendor-Managed Inventory emerges as a pivotal catalyst for transformative change in Indian businesses.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"wOAupRjzblIC+mgnkKfdcEvbdO4GFMO1Gz7XJ9f4x0Q=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"7ea4aa0d-a595-4e07-8443-322f211875f8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"7ea4aa0d-a595-4e07-8443-322f211875f8\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"97486854-9844-45b8-b9a2-3be49f6bb69c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"a0aj/X5tYC0M53cLAte0ADyYUtjonxI3T2kY2/qTILU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"67ca608f-ac3e-4f0c-9df3-f1948604f4eb\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Q6PWRiJfpE4jlf2D6hVjg5/LEla9rU3WHTvZ0BvM58E=\"}},\"text\":\"The

2022, Indian shoppers spent over 8.7 billion hours on shopping apps, which is almost 50 percent higher than the numbers in 2019.More and more people are now choosing to shop online, demanding seamless, personalized interactions at every touchpoint.This makes it imperative for e-commerce businesses to embrace innovation and introduce exceptional functionalities that ensure remarkable customer experiences.This would further enable them to gain a competitive edge and capture a larger share of the market.One such powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize customer

lose trust in businesses that fail to deliver targeted communication.AI has also been making great strides in simplifying product search on e-commerce platforms.With the sheer number of products available on any e-commerce platform, finding the right product at times becomes overwhelming for customers.This complexity often prompts shoppers to abandon their carts and leave without making an actual purchase.In India, the average cart abandonment rate is 51 percent.However, with the integration of AI in e-commerce, the search process has been greatly simplified.AI-powered insights enable e-commerce players and aggregators to provide relevant filters and sorting options, which makes it easier for shoppers to quickly find what they need.Moreover, voice search mechanisms that are quick to understand human speech, are playing a key role in changing the dynamics of product search on online shopping platforms.Additionally, e-commerce companies deal with complex logistics challenges to ensure timely delivery of products to consumers.This happens at the back end and involves massive coordination between various suppliers, warehouses, and shipping partners.AI-driven inventory management has proved to be extremely advantageous in this case.By analyzing historical data and current market conditions, the use of AI allows e-commerce businesses to accurately predict product demand.This knowledge further allows them to optimize their stock levels and mitigate the risks of stock surplus or shortages.The use of AI robots have proved effective in enhancing warehouse efficiency by streamlining order processing and reducing human error.Additionally, AI can efficiently predict lead times, transportation delays, and other supply chain disruptions, which makes it easier for businesses to make proactive adjustments.By automating repetitive tasks and providing real-time insights on the best shipping routes, AI can help businesses deliver products faster, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.Looking at the current trend, 51 percent of e-commerce businesses have already integrated AI into their operations to create highly distinct customer experiences.The trend is swiftly becoming more widespread, with AI knocking on the doors of many more players.Gazing into the future, as the technology continues to evolve and penetrate deeper into the e-commerce ecosystem, more possibilities for enhancing customer experience are likely to emerge in this space.Businesses that can harness the disruptive power of AI will secure a long-term advantage in attracting and retaining customers.For others, the battle could prove to be tough, since, in today’s hyper-competitive era, it is always the survival of the fittest.About the

2023 / 9 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In the heart of the ever-evolving digital landscape, the Kids' Digital Entertainment Market stands as a dynamic realm, where creativity, technology, and imagination converge to shape the narratives that captivate young minds.A recent panel discussion, featuring industry leaders, delved into the nuances of this fascinating journey, shedding light on cross-media franchises, interactive storytelling, and the transformative impact of technology.Cross-Media Franchises: Weaving Anime's Tapestry Beyond Screens\\nThe panel discussion kicked off with Ashish Kulkarni, Chairman of AVGC-XR Forum - FICCI & Founder - Punnaryug Artvision, unraveling the trend of anime being adapted into various media forms.He remarked, \\\"Cross-media franchises have become a powerhouse in the kids' entertainment market.The adaptation of anime into video games, novels, and movies creates a multi-dimensional universe that engages fans across different platforms.\\\"This trend mirrors the industry's response to the changing preferences of young audiences.A stroll through the digital landscape reveals iconic anime series seamlessly transcending the boundaries of the screen, extending their narrative prowess into interactive gaming experiences, gripping novels, and blockbuster movies.The benefits are two-fold, as Kulkarni explains: \\\"Expanding the anime narrative across different media not only broadens the reach but also fosters a deeper connection with the audience.Fans can immerse themselves in the story through diverse mediums, enhancing the overall storytelling experience.\\\"Navigating Challenges: The Tightrope Walk of Expanding Narratives\\nHowever, the path to crafting cross-media franchises is not without its challenges.Manoj Mishra, CEO of Powerkids Entertainment, sheds light on the delicate balancing act required.\\\"Maintaining narrative coherence across various platforms is a challenge.Each medium comes with its unique storytelling demands, and harmonizing these elements while staying true to the essence of the original content is crucial.\\\"Mishra's insight reflects the industry's quest for synergy, striving to seamlessly translate the magic of anime into formats that resonate with diverse audiences.This challenge, while daunting, serves as a catalyst for innovation, pushing creators to explore new dimensions of storytelling.Rise of Interactive and Gamified Content: A Playground for Imagination\\nAs the discussion pivots, Munjal B.Shroff, Co-founder of Graphiti Studios, highlights the rising tide of interactive and gamified content for kids.He notes, \\\"The landscape is evolving, and today's kids crave more than passive viewing.They seek participative experiences where they can shape the narrative.Interactive content, whether in the form of games or immersive storytelling apps, empowers children to be co-creators of their entertainment.\\\"Shroff's observation aligns with the industry's response to the digital-native generation.From educational games that make learning fun to interactive story apps that encourage decision-making, the market is witnessing a paradigm shift towards engagement-driven content.Technological Marvels: Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality in Kids' Entertainment\\nIn the realm of kids' digital entertainment, technology plays a pivotal role in transforming experiences.Ashish Kulkarni, a tech visionary in the space, delves into the impact of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\\\"AR and VR are not just buzzwords; they're transformative tools that redefine how children engage with entertainment.These technologies open portals to fantastical worlds, allowing kids to step beyond the screen and be active participants in the narrative.\\\"The adoption of AR and VR in kids' content is evident in the array of educational AR apps and VR experiences tailored for young audiences.These technologies not only add an immersive layer to entertainment but also provide educational value, blending learning seamlessly with play.\\\"The fusion of technology and storytelling is not just a trend; it's a necessity.We need to adapt to the changing preferences of our tech-savvy audience while ensuring that the essence of storytelling remains intact,\\\" emphasizes Ashish Kulkarni.Interactive Storytelling: Nurturing Cognitive Development\\nAs the narrative unfolds, the impact of interactive storytelling on children's cognitive development takes center stage.Manoj Mishra reflects on this aspect, stating, \\\"Interactive

E-commerce\\nAvoiding Downtime During the Festive Season: Why E-Commerce Companies Need Observability\\nBY - Guest author\\nNov 24, 2023 / 8 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  It’s the time of the year when retailers and e-commerce businesses in India ramp up for annual festive season sales.Annual sale events are crucial to the industry, and in 2022 alone, India’s e-commerce industry reached Rs 40,000 crore ($480 million) in revenue.In a few days from now, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will be here.12.7 percent of annual shopping will take place across this eight-day shopping marathon, making it one of the largest drivers of revenue for the Indian retail market.When large, revenue-driving sales are underway, businesses face challenges with maintaining the uptime of their websites and mobile apps due to an increase in traffic.Because downtime drives customers away, competitors with more reliable systems will come out on top.When website and mobile app traffic volumes rise during sale days, backend teams need to constantly fight issues, which they may not be able to address fast enough.This is perhaps why research into Cyber Monday sales revealed that only 36 percent of customers in India were satisfied with their online experience during this sale period.Today’s retailers face fierce competition amid a risky macroeconomic climate, with major hikes in energy costs, growing inflation, interest rates and supply chain disruptions causing consumers to tighten their purse strings.This makes festive sales even more critical, as customers look to find a bargain.With millions of dollars on the line, it is critical for retailers to double down on their digital customer experience (DCX) strategies to create seamless customer journeys.Observability is important here, as it allows teams to proactively analyze and optimize their systems based on logs, metrics and traces, in order to provide a real-time view of collated data.Retailers need powerful AI-driven observability solutions to ensure they can offer seamless customer experiences for festive season shoppers.The Cost of Doing Business without Observability\\nWith the festive season sales already well underway, Indian e-commerce and retail businesses must ensure that their services can scale efficiently to meet the demand of peak traffic periods, as even a small outage can have an adverse impact.According to the New Relic State of Observability in Retail report, nearly 4 in 10 global retailers report having high-impact outages once a week.What’s concerning is the time taken to resolve these, as the longer a resolution takes, the more revenue is lost.Currently, 61 percent of retailers say it takes at least 30 minutes to resolve such outages, and this is costing them dearly.The median annual cost of IT outages among retailers stands at $9.95 million.During a sale, this could mean more revenue is lost.For businesses that aren’t using full-stack observability, the process of finding and fixing issues becomes very difficult and ultimately ends up costing the business new customers and brand loyalty.Fixing Incidents Quickly to Maintain Uptime\\nRetailers are realizing the benefits of observability because the payoff is evident.By adopting observability, retailers improved the time taken to detect and fix incidents.Many of them are realising the monetary benefits of maintaining uptime.The State of Observability in Retail report also revealed that nearly 60 percent of retailers derived more than $500,000 in total annual value, with 43 percent saying they derived a total annual value of $1 million or more after adopting observability.In most retail and e-commerce companies, the responsibility for maintaining uptime falls on engineering teams.To enable an omnichannel approach, retailers often depend on third-party solutions that they have little or no access to like kiosks, video cameras and POS systems.They also use different technologies for payments and external distribution logistics.With such a variety of technology in play, teams often find it challenging to easily implement telemetry in their retail strategy.And when outages occur, engineering teams at the backend have to spend hours trying to parse logs, analyse metrics and toggle between different monitoring tools.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"7CdZsbAkrek8EnnvxhHZx2CMgaCEhmNHJQFygQufpqc=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8a538f9b-2c74-4f48-958c-1f14f6ee0243":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8a538f9b-2c74-4f48-958c-1f14f6ee0243\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a300846b-6a41-4841-a670-1b69565e49eb\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"jXR/eBRIs/OjjkbzDQD3UQtPYo0w8UQ2oL6/jA4chS4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"a36fa4ae-48ba-4ffa-8351-32589161fdb1\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"ie22oEMjx4ioUUDbU400E24LCMbAPYF8yNCR8EPIQqA=\"}},\"text\":\"By

logs, analyse metrics and toggle between different monitoring tools.Spending a significant amount of time on fixing a single issue can pose a challenge to maintaining uptime.All-in-one observability platforms consolidate the entire process of monitoring and analyzing the IT infrastructure.It helps engineering teams find out what’s going wrong and also to derive valuable context of how it went wrong and what’s needed to fix the problem.When these processes are automated, DevOps teams can fix issues faster, ensuring uptime.Retailers aiming to keep their digital storefronts operational this festive season must invest in full-stack observability.This will provide them with comprehensive visibility into their software, and the ability to proactively collect and visualise data, apply intelligence and understand the behaviour of the IT ecosystems.Observability solutions have emerged as a competitive differentiator for retailers and ecommerce companies, and the time for these businesses to adopt them is now.Otherwise, they risk losing millions in revenue.Author: Prasad Rai, Vice President Sales for India, New Relic\\n  eComerce\\nNext Story\\nTechnology &

growing influence of immersive technologies is charting the way for retailers into the evolutionary world of the Metaverse.Retail giants like Nike, Gucci, and Adidas among others have already made a foray into the virtual world by buying real estate, building digital stores, conducting fashion shows, and hosting concerts.The future state of this space holds a lot of promise for retailers as it is expected to create a digital connection between the customer and the brand, like never before.Retail brands are excited about the opportunity as it provides them with direct access to zero-party data of customers, enabling retailers and service providers to establish a hyper-personalized connection with the customers.The customer is enthusiastic and buoyed by the surreal experience that is being rendered across these new digital platforms, which promises to better all previous experiences from the past.Expanding the Expanse with Omnichannel Integration\\nPowering the futuristic omnichannel retail ecosystem at the front end will be a headless commerce architecture that delivers a distinctive, consistent customer experience across channels and supports all touchpoints with shared functionalities, such as wish lists, appointment booking, and payments.This architecture is also expected to be more scalable and flexible than a traditional monolithic architecture as it is decoupled from the backend giving retailers the ability to drive changes faster.The world is steadfastly embracing IoT in the shape of wearables, home automation, and more.The headless architecture will help retailers deliver content across each device type without reinventing the wheel, keeping the experience consistent.Talking of the backend, the move towards a microservices-based architecture at the backend can also be a game changer for retailers.This decoupling of the monolithic architecture at the backend will help retailers to upgrade or revamp a specific function quickly, for example integrating biometrics into the sign-in function or integrating gesture recognition for payment.These new-age capabilities can be separately developed and deployed in a modular fashion.This is unlike how it is done in the traditional monolithic architecture where the complete system would need a revamp for the addition of any functionality.Blockchain Safeguarding Digital Assets Across the Virtual Terrain\\nBlockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that provides robust security and transparency for safeguarding digital assets in the retail sector across the digital landscape.Through its immutable and distributed nature, blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and data, reducing fraud and enhancing trust.For example, in supply chain management, blockchain can trace the origin and journey of products, allowing customers to verify the authenticity and quality of goods.It also acts as a powerful tool for driving sustainability within the retail sector by providing retailers insight into their supply chains, promoting responsible sourcing and reducing waste.By verifying product authenticity, blockchain helps combat counterfeiting, ensuring that consumers receive genuine, quality products discouraging the production of environmentally damaging fakes.In e-commerce, blockchain-based payment systems like Bitcoin offer secure and borderless transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries.Blockchain can also be a game changer in driving loyalty programs enabling retailers to offer customers rewards securely, while smart contracts, an agreement based on blockchain technology that kicks in automatically once certain conditions are met, can enforce credible, transparent agreements on product authenticity, warranties, or refund policies, ensuring a seamless and trust-driven retail experience.Blockchain holds significant value in a rapidly digitizing world that is embracing Non-Fungible Tokens, or unique digital identifiers recorded on a blockchain ledger as an identification of ownership and authenticity for digital assets such as art, music, fashion, or any other collectible owned by an entity.One of the main advantages of NFTs is that they allow people to own and intellectual property.NFT cannot be replicated, a strong reason why fashion labels, and multinational retail conglomerates, are exploring the use of NFTs to secure ownership of digital assets and thwart counterfeiting.Embracing the Future of Retail Technology, Today\\nAs inflation and fears of an economic slowdown weigh heavy on the minds of consumers, curtailing their spending, retailers will need to embrace the advances in technology to attract, convince, and drive sales to build an all-encompassing retail ecosystem.Retailers will need to deploy new-age strategies powered by contemporary technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, augmented and virtual reality, and more to get up close and personal with their customers building long-lasting trust and value.Retailers will have to look at technology not just for delivering convenience and experience but also as a medium to drive sustainability and

convenient shopping encounters.Phygital technology is pivotal in merging online and offline retail, enabling retailers to offer customers a harmonious blend of traditional and online shopping benefits.Why is Phygital Relevant?Understanding the significance of phygital requires tracing the evolution of shopping.Traditionally, shopping meant physically visiting a store mostly in groups either, either with families, or friends, exploring products, and making a purchase.However, the emergence of e-commerce has transformed this process, allowing customers to shop individually from home and receive deliveries.While e-commerce offers convenience and variety, it lacks the physical and social aspects of traditional shopping.Phygital retail addresses this gap by merging online and offline experiences, providing a seamless customer journey.Phygital technology incorporates various tools like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), interactive displays, and mobile apps or even a physical experience stores.These innovations empower retailers to craft immersive experiences, engaging customers both online and in physical stores.It also enables consumers to explore the brand further by providing an opportunity to engage with the brand physically while also enjoying the convenience of digital shopping.Same-day deliveries are also becoming increasingly common.Importance of Phygital Marketing in Retail\\nPhygital has emerged as a crucial strategy for modern businesses, responding to the growing demand for seamless and consistent customer experiences.This approach integrates the physical and digital dimensions of a brand, fostering a robust brand identity and cultivating lasting customer loyalty.One of its key merits lies in the realm of personalization.Through adept use of data and analytics, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to cater to specific consumer needs, both online and offline.This level of customization forges a profound connection with consumers, leading to heightened loyalty and enthusiastic brand advocacy.Furthermore, phygital marketing in retail offers a distinct advantage by enabling the creation of a unique brand identity.The fusion of physical and digital elements allows businesses to craft a memorable and distinctive brand encounter, setting them apart from competitors.This not only fosters brand loyalty but also bolsters customer retention significantly.In the realm of outreach, phygital strategies widen the audience net.Digital channels complement physical presence, enabling businesses to showcase their in-store displays through social media or establish online stores to supplement their brick-and-mortar locations.Additionally, phygital marketing serves as an invaluable tool for understanding customer behavior and preferences.By meticulously tracking interactions across various touchpoints, businesses can gain profound insights into what stimulates customer engagement and loyalty.Armed with this knowledge, they can optimize their marketing and sales approaches effectively.In our increasingly interconnected world, it is imperative for brands to evolve in response to shifting consumer demands and expectations.The fusion of physical and digital realms, known as Phygital, represents the future of retail, promising substantial benefits for those who adopt it.Although Phygital concepts are still in their early stages, their permanence in the market is evident.As technology progresses, we anticipate witnessing more inventive approaches from brands in seamlessly connecting physical and digital experiences.Author:  Aman Jain, Co-founder and CEO, Doodhvale\\n  physical retail\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nClick & Mortar: The

- Guest author\\nOct 28, 2023 / 9 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  A big part of the nation's industrial innovation is played by the logistics industries.Similar to the developed countries, India is accessible to technological progress.Technology and logistics are two of the many sectors that are connected.Wherever technology is extensively used.Due to modern business methods and innovations, the flow of commodities from manufacturers, merchants, or wholesalers to customers has changed.The transition from manual to automated technologies and communication, as well as advancements in information technology, have had a significant impact on the logistics business.As a result, it is now crucial to keep track of the supply chain and the transparency of logistical activity in order to maintain the needed pace, ensure customer happiness, and guard against any delivery ecosystem inefficiencies.Below are some prominent ways that the Indian logistics sector has been transformed by technological advancements:\\nImproved Supply Chain Management\\nDue to AI's crucial position in supply chain management, technology has undergone tremendous change.One example is the development of predictive optimization, which is anticipated to become one of the biggest forces in the logistics sector.The entire supply chain is strengthened and improved through supply chain visibility solutions, which provide constant data access to all users.Predictive optimization facilitates efficient last-mile delivery by bridging the supply and demand gap through accurate forecasts.The last-mile delivery intelligence, which includes route optimization and ETA prediction, will also ensure smooth operations.Digitization Ends Warehousing Problems\\nOne of the most important advantages of digital warehousing is increased visibility.Real-time understanding of inventory levels and shipment status is hampered by slow, error-prone manual methods, which cause delays and mistakes.Similar to how this data may be organized, warehouse management systems (WMS) may provide staff with real-time positional information.This level of sight helps warehouses avoid several common accidents.Improved visibility makes warehouses more useful.This augmentation might be most obvious in preference.Employees who are knowledgeable about the precise position of every item spend less time rummaging through and perusing shelves.Enhanced Routing Assistance\\nAnother important impact of technical developments on the logistics industry is the enhancement of routing.Modern GPS technology makes it unlikely that drivers would get lost or that consumers will have to wait for deliveries.Technology can also be used to optimize routes, ensuring that drivers take the fastest paths possible to their destinations.In addition to knowing this before leaving, drivers can also be notified of a better route while on the road, depending on things like traffic jams, roadwork, or other unexpected delays.Businesses benefit from this flexibility to take more economical routes because it lowers fuel costs and vehicle usage.Smooth Functioning\\nThe ability to track a product's delivery

GPS technology makes it unlikely that drivers would get lost or that consumers will have to wait for deliveries.Technology can also be used to optimize routes, ensuring that drivers take the fastest paths possible to their destinations.In addition to knowing this before leaving, drivers can also be notified of a better route while on the road, depending on things like traffic jams, roadwork, or other unexpected delays.Businesses benefit from this flexibility to take more economical routes because it lowers fuel costs and vehicle usage.Smooth Functioning\\nThe ability to track a product's delivery from start to finish is one of the most common client expectations in logistics.Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to monitor an object's temperature and location.The position and temperature of items being moved by vehicles can also be tracked using IoT.The logistics sector is seeing substantial changes in its manufacturing processes as a result of technical improvements and the e-commerce boom.The use of data to drive operations and decision-making will rise as logistics becomes more and more digitized.A seamless exchange of information between humans and machines will result from AI data analytics.AI can ascertain how logistics movement might be optimized by analyzing data and automating procedures like capacity estimation, demand patterns, network analysis, and other similar elements.The improvement of fleet performance visibility is one of the most significant ways AI may assist in lowering logistics costs.A logistics platform powered by AI would allow for precise load-vehicle matching and onboard capacity optimization.With fewer trucks, it would be possible to transport shipments that currently demand more trucks, reducing overall vehicle overburden.A logistics company can significantly increase its cost utilization in warehousing by implementing AI-based automation in inventory management.Time is saved, and fewer human resources are required, which also lowers operational costs.Tech Powered Fourth-Party Logistics\\nWith a 4PL, a firm outsources all of its logistics, supply chain management, and supply chain optimization to an outside logistics service provider.All distribution chain and logistics tasks are handled by 4PL Logistics, which also keeps an eye on the operational and financial effectiveness of the supply chain.These logistic aggregators cover all aspects of a company's logistics needs as well as its strategic planning.They also collaborate with 3PLs to outsource some logistics and transportation-related tasks.Significant changes in the logistics processes are made as a result of a 4PL company's strategic, operational, and technological partnership, increasing efficiency and lowering costs.One of a 4PL's key features is that it provides total visibility, real-time information, and communication to gather, store, and manage supply chain data\\nEven if reinventing the processes is necessary, Indian logistics firms must invest in modernizing technologies to create creative and effective solutions.Robotics and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used to automate operations in warehouse and transportation management.As a result, companies will be able to use fewer human help.About the Author\\nPawan Kumar, Co-Founder of Shipease\\n    Indian Logistics Industrytechnological

Media\\nOct 25, 2023 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  Despite a challenging start to the year in CY23, online sellers are gearing up for a festive season comeback.They anticipate a substantial year-on-year sales boost of at least 15 percent during the upcoming festive period.The median projection stands at an impressive 26 percent growth compared to last year's festive season.Sellers spanning various product categories, including those with lower average selling prices like fashion, are displaying a bullish outlook on this growth trajectory.This surge in sales is poised to offer a much-needed respite in the face of an otherwise demanding macroeconomic environment.The latest report by Redseer Strategy Consultants on the Indian festive season, reveals the market readiness and seller’s bullish sentiments for a profitable festive season.Redseer surveyed a few hundred sellers (primarily the smaller sellers) prior to the festive sales 2023.Our findings show that despite modest sales growth on e-commerce platforms recently (only 40 percent of sellers we surveyed reported a >10 percent increase in current quarter sales vs JFM 23 quarter), anticipation for a festive sales boost amongst the sellers is high across categories.e-Commerce platforms are tailoring solutions to meet the optimism of sellers and as a consequence of which, seller perceptions around support provided by eTailing platforms have seen an uptick – with 62 percent of sellers agreeing with the sentiment that the platforms have been supportive in their festive planning vs. 53 percent sellers who observed this in the lead-up to the last year’s festive season.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"WaG2+EICM1ti1hp+5bWKHv/s06YIioMVxyMJZ1P0PE0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"54e1495e-9bfe-44a9-9be4-6a6c4d06c8e4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"54e1495e-9bfe-44a9-9be4-6a6c4d06c8e4\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a00948f8-10dc-4792-8a0e-fe59860a66b5\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"Y6OJuqLq6c0eH3oiXYfLgsQmlmi/QCM0W++v/2qeFKg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"2612da65-5f44-4ba3-82be-74adddda3f47\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"U/c3RH9/leSqw83tnKJj8pcgw18qAUssJcj6L0aXIsg=\"}},\"text\":\"The

have highlighted the strong support received from platforms in terms of data analytics, trends predictions, and consumer visibility, among others.Driven by this seller bullishness, they are expected to ramp up their ad spendings on the online platforms meaningfully- creating the right sales impact for themselves and also benefiting the platforms\\nOur survey results indicate that sellers are willing to spend more on marketing/advertising during the festive season on online platforms to drive sales growth.Overall, across the surveyed sellers, they anticipate a 15 percent spending growth vs last year’s festive season and 50 percent ad spending growth vs business as usual (BAU) periods of this year.Interestingly, smaller sellers are highly willing to spend on ads and bullish on overall sales growth- smaller sellers anticipate a 22 percent ad spend growth vs last festive season and 75 percent growth vs BAU period of this year per our surveys.“Our interactions with sellers prior to this 10th eCommerce festive season reaffirms the transformative impact eCommerce has on these MSMEs.The festive period is expected to enable sellers especially the smaller ones to come out of the challenging sales environment seen through this and sellers are optimistic about strong sales growth.Accordingly, they are willing to significantly ramp up their advertising spending on the e-commerce platforms during this festive period.In the longer term, more and more sellers will continue to benefit from eCommerce growth given its strong positive impact on seller topline and bottom line that emerges from our research,” says Mrigank Gutgutia, Partner at Redseer Strategy Consultants.Online sellinge-commerceFestive season\\nNext Story\\nTechnology & E-commerce\\nThe Data-Driven Future of D2C Retail: Personalization & AI in E-Commerce\\nBY - Guest author\\nOct 23, 2023 / 6 MIN READ\\nFollow Us\\n  In the dynamic realm of retail, one phrase has emerged as the ultimate mantra for success: \\\"Direct-to-Consumer\\\" or D2C.This approach has fundamentally altered how businesses connect with their audience by eliminating intermediaries and establishing direct relationships.However, in today's digital commerce landscape, marked by intense competition and soaring consumer expectations, thriving as a D2C brand requires more than just cutting out the middleman.It necessitates a strategic blend of two forces: personalization and artificial intelligence (AI).D2C, short for Direct-to-Consumer, represents a business model empowering brands to oversee every aspect from production to marketing and order fulfillment.This model has surged in popularity due to a growing appetite for unique, personalized products.In contrast to the traditional supplier-to-retailer (S2R) approach, where intermediaries like wholesalers come into play, D2C brands directly sell their products through various channels, including e-commerce websites, mobile apps, and brand-owned physical stores.Freed from shelf space constraints and intermediary pricing policies, D2C brands leverage their in-depth knowledge of their target audience to curate captivating product offerings, fueling innovation and fostering close client relationships.When it comes to  Artificial Intelligence, which is gaining a stronger foothold in our world day by day, D2C brands are not only able to collect data about consumers but also derive meaningful insights from it.This data-driven strategy enables brands to curate product catalogs with unmatched accuracy, anticipate consumer needs, and optimize pricing strategies.These brands can improve their marketing strategies, streamline their business processes, gain greater insight into their customers, and ultimately thrive in the market by utilising the power of AI.For example, imagine an online store that knows exactly what you’re looking for.It recommends products that you didn’t even think you needed.Such is the strength of AI personalization, allowing consumers to enjoy a highly curated experience.This in turn leads to a rise in consumer loyalty as well as conversions.An advantage artificial intelligence has over the human mind is that it is able to analyze and process large amounts of data, identifying patterns that humans might miss.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"IQnCc5iWV09iGDqk17YaxseeXnbjXdBHXmpOiLH+qEs=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2612da65-5f44-4ba3-82be-74adddda3f47":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2612da65-5f44-4ba3-82be-74adddda3f47\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ceb09867-51bb-4a2d-b6c3-3a514c22ebf0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"V2qN/5zdsT0lHeK5RcThCSFXKK6w4gYezqb+tQqY7Sg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"54e1495e-9bfe-44a9-9be4-6a6c4d06c8e4\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.indianretailer.com/article/technology-e-commerce/logistics-supply-chain/how-shipway-revolutionizing-logistics-tier-2-3\"},\"hash\":\"gJ7Q7GcWM/rvLVhXF96zlLxlXG8RYg61wBBEK8SYXsE=\"}},\"text\":\"When

of data, identifying patterns that humans might miss.AI-driven recommendation engines leverage customer browsing and buying patterns to offer tailored product suggestions and content, thereby enhancing the likelihood of customers completing a purchase.Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands are reshaping the retail landscape through a powerful arsenal of AI-driven tools, such as recommendation engines, dynamic pricing algorithms, personalized email marketing, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, machine learning, augmented reality (AR), and virtual assistants.This technological synergy enables D2C brands to deeply connect with consumers and redefine their shopping experience while transcending traditional retail norms.Beyond customer engagement, these tools optimize operations, predict market trends, manage inventory efficiently, and reduce costs and waste through machine learning.Augmented reality and virtual assistants further elevate the customer journey, offering real-world product visualization and personalized assistance.As a result, D2C brands are thriving and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the retail industry, creating a more seamless and immersive shopping experience for consumers.In a world where competition is fierce and consumer expectations are higher than ever, D2C brands that embrace personalization and AI as core pillars of their strategy are not only surviving but thriving in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.As technology continues to advance, it's clear that the future of D2C retail will be defined by those who harness the potential of AI to forge deeper connections with their customers and deliver exceptional, tailor-made experiences.About the Author\\nParth Patel, Co-founder & Director,
