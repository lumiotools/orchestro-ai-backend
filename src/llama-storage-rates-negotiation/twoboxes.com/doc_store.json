With high-volume partners, you get density, and density leads to better optimization and economic advantage.\\\" – Bill Catania</p><p><strong>[00:11:00 - 00:11:30]</strong> - \\\"If you think you have a good idea, just jump in and do it. The fact is, whatever you build initially isn't what will take you to the rocket ship — it will evolve. Avoid analysis paralysis and act.\\\" – Ninaad Acharya</p><p><strong>[00:22:34 - 00:22:59]</strong> - \\\"We always work at the SKU level because inventory, transportation, and consumer data have to align in real time. Knowing item specifics allows us to optimize the entire fulfillment process.\\\" – Bill Catania</p><p><strong>[00:29:00 - 00:29:30]</strong> - \\\"To achieve the 'Amazon experience,' you need real-time decision-making between transportation and fulfillment while the customer is still on the product page. It’s about aligning inventory and transportation seamlessly.\\\" – Ninaad Acharya</p><p><strong>[00:14:00 - 00:14:29]</strong> - \\\"You don’t quit.

With high-volume partners, you get density, and density leads to better optimization and economic advantage.\\\" – Bill Catania</p><p><strong>[00:11:00 - 00:11:30]</strong> - \\\"If you think you have a good idea, just jump in and do it. The fact is, whatever you build initially isn't what will take you to the rocket ship — it will evolve. Avoid analysis paralysis and act.\\\" – Ninaad Acharya</p><p><strong>[00:22:34 - 00:22:59]</strong> - \\\"We always work at the SKU level because inventory, transportation, and consumer data have to align in real time. Knowing item specifics allows us to optimize the entire fulfillment process.\\\" – Bill Catania</p><p><strong>[00:29:00 - 00:29:30]</strong> - \\\"To achieve the 'Amazon experience,' you need real-time decision-making between transportation and fulfillment while the customer is still on the product page. It’s about aligning inventory and transportation seamlessly.\\\" – Ninaad Acharya</p><p><strong>[00:14:00 - 00:14:29]</strong> - \\\"You don’t quit. You pivot, you tweak, and figure out where you can add value. In logistics, finding where you can provide the most value is what keeps you moving forward.\\\" – Bill Catania</p><p><strong>FIND MORE ABOUT THE GUEST:</strong></p><p>LinkedIn: <a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/billcatania/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Bill Catania</a></p><p>Website: <a href=\\\"https://www.onerail.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">OneRail</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\\\"https://x.com/onerailapp\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">@OneRailTech</a></p> <p><p><strong>Subscribe and Keep Learning!</strong></p><p>If you’re a logistics leader looking to scale sustainably, don’t miss out!

And eCommerce to film is a classic example, right? If you think about a warehouse. You know, all day long is picking and packing and picking and packing. Uh, but the part that makes that task hard to automate is that you could be picking and packing 10 million or 20 million different objects, right?

Simon: “Running a warehouse today is very hard because of the labor problem, right? The, it's, it's very hard to find, to recruit, to train and to retain hundreds or thousands of people.

You know, by the number of nodes in, in your network by three nodes, four nodes, five nodes, you know, whatever it might be. And so that, you know, you're quickly managing thousands of people. It takes a lot of money and, and effort and overhead to manage all of that.

Making sure that customers' expectations are met every time they come to your store is much harder than it sounds. Mark talks about the overall value of visibility not only for customer experience but for more efficient processes on the business side.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT MARK</strong></p><p>Mark Delaney is currently VP Industry Strategy at FourKites. In this role, he engages with retailers’ C-level leaders and their teams to understand and address industry-specific workflows and use cases. He serves as an SME to help drive the product roadmap and support our global sales teams. He keeps a strong pulse on industry trends and frequently solicits customer and partner’s feedback on the technology investments that they are making to help inform and advance FourKite’s innovation with a customer-first mindset. He represents FourKites at industry events and briefings. Prior to FourKites, Mark was a Retail Industry Principal at Zebra Technologies where he led customer briefings, met with the press and analysts and worked with their Ventures organization evaluating potential investments.</p><p><br /> </p><p>Mark has more than 20 years of experience in the retail industry and has worked with most large retailers globally. Before joining Zebra, Mark held leadership roles at Nielsen and General Mills and owned his own retail technology and analytics consulting firm.</p><p> </p><p>Mark holds a BS in Marketing from SUNY Oswego and serves on several boards in his community.

Now because that loyalty's been shattered, there's a very good chance they're going to go across the street to your competitor.\\\"<br /> </p><p>21:56 The importance of listening to consumers and customers - Mark: \\\"One other area that's top of mind with our customers these days is employee satisfaction. Because it's very expensive to lose a good employee, especially someone who's been there for a period of time and you've invested in all that training. For them to be mired down by spreadsheets and phone calls and all that, if you can give them that visibility and confidence that they're communicating something that's accurate, they feel better as associates.\\\"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Find out more about Mark in the links below:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjdelaney001/\\\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjdelaney001/</a></li><li>Website: <a href=\\\"https://www.fourkites.com/\\\">https://www.fourkites.com/</a></li></ul> <p><p><strong>Subscribe and Keep Learning!</strong></p><p>If you’re a logistics leader looking to scale sustainably, don’t miss out!

Now because that loyalty's been shattered, there's a very good chance they're going to go across the street to your competitor.\\\" 21:56 The importance of listening to consumers and customers - Mark: \\\"One other area that's top of mind with our customers these days is employee satisfaction. Because it's very expensive to lose a good employee, especially someone who's been there for a period of time and you've invested in all that training. For them to be mired down by spreadsheets and phone calls and all that, if you can give them that visibility and confidence that they're communicating something that's accurate, they feel better as associates.\\\" Find out more about Mark in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjdelaney001/ Website: https://www.fourkites.com/</itunes:summary>\\n<itunes:subtitle>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Mark Delaney, Vice President of Global Industry Strategy at FourKites.

HIGHLIGHTS 02:31 How Sandra led as the first-ever Chief Supply Chain Officer of Kimberly-Clark 09:33 Must-have attributes when building a team for supply chain 13:29 The top priorities leading Mondelēz at the start of the pandemic 23:26 On moving to digital 27:54 Comparing regional innovation and sustainability 36:51 What we can expect with automation in the CPG QUOTES 04:28 Sandra's advice for future supply chain leadership: \\\"Don't lose sight of what supply chain is, is what I would say at the start. There are key principles that we have in supply chain around who we are and what we are. They apply anywhere. So if anybody tells you, you have to rethink everything, that's not true. There's core, basic fundamentals, service quality, safety, and all these kinds of things. 29:13 We should connect together where we can - Sandra: \\\"If they've not had recognition, they feel the need to be seen, so it has to be theirs. And as opposed to when we get to, hopefully at some point when business and the corporate world gets to the place where we're gonna share with each other for the better of everything. It sounds a bit naive, but I do believe that's what we should be doing corporately.\\\" Find out more about Sandra in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandramacquillan/</itunes:subtitle>\\n<itunes:keywords>dan coll, ecom logistics podcast, e-commerce retail, procurement, logistics, supply chain, fulfillment iq, ninaad acharya, sustainability, sandra macquillan</itunes:keywords>\\n<itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit>\\n<itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>\\n<itunes:episode>23</itunes:episode>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<guid isPermaLink=\\\"false\\\">8f940526-b08f-4691-a829-b951adce35e9</guid>\\n<title>How To Transition to Sustainable Fleet Operations Using Data and Logistics with Essa Al-Saleh</title>\\n<description>\\n<![CDATA[ <p>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Essa Al-Saleh, CEO and Board Member of Volta Trucks.

Being the true last mile partner where orders are delivered the same day they pick it up has been the goal of Alok's company. They wanted to be hyperlocal and empower local SMBs to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world. </p><p>Alok digs into why different last-mile solutions exist to address the needs of different types of buyers. He also explains that, given their low barrier for entry, that local shops can be given a low risk alternative to see how they can offer a comparable solution to Amazon and grow their business.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT ALOK</strong></p><p>Alok has over 15 years in software, technology and e-commerce. Along with his co-founders, Alok has created a platform, in Trexity, that makes it possible for any small business to deliver quickly and locally. Alok is a serial entrepreneur who encourages and supports like-minded individuals to succeed in their business.</p><p>Alok began imagining a platform that could make it possible for any small business to deliver local and fast, and one that is fair and takes advantage of neither merchants nor couriers. He believes that filling this need will help disrupt our over-reliance on faraway e-commerce giants and help small businesses stay in business. </p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>01:20 Alok's early exposure to business and his passion for technology</li><li>06:01 Perfecting last-mile, hyperlocal delivery for SMBs</li><li>12:38 The future of last-mile delivery: Owned Infrastructure vs. the Gig Economy  </li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p>07:50 Perfecting hyperlocal delivery opened up national markets for Trexity - Alok: \\\"We started out empowering your favorite store on your favorite street of your favorite neighborhood. The local mom and pop. And on of the things that was really important to us when we started out, we said, let's be the true last mile partner. The same day we pick it up, it's the same day we're going to drop it off, as fast as our merchants are willing to fulfill it, it's as fast as we will deliver it. And let this be the one thing that we do so perfectly well that no one else can touch us on it.\\\" </p><p>13:25 Owned-infrastructure and gig economy have their own pros and cons - Alok: \\\"It's not one or the other. Both of those FedEx models exist for a reason because there's an addressable market for both of them. And I don't think it has to be warehousing or direct from merchant. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

Being the true last mile partner where orders are delivered the same day they pick it up has been the goal of Alok's company. They wanted to be hyperlocal and empower local SMBs to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world. Alok digs into why different last-mile solutions exist to address the needs of different types of buyers. He also explains that, given their low barrier for entry, that local shops can be given a low risk alternative to see how they can offer a comparable solution to Amazon and grow their business. ABOUT ALOK Alok has over 15 years in software, technology and e-commerce. Along with his co-founders, Alok has created a platform, in Trexity, that makes it possible for any small business to deliver quickly and locally. Alok is a serial entrepreneur who encourages and supports like-minded individuals to succeed in their business. Alok began imagining a platform that could make it possible for any small business to deliver local and fast, and one that is fair and takes advantage of neither merchants nor couriers. He believes that filling this need will help disrupt our over-reliance on faraway e-commerce giants and help small businesses stay in business. HIGHLIGHTS 01:20 Alok's early exposure to business and his passion for technology 06:01 Perfecting last-mile, hyperlocal delivery for SMBs 12:38 The future of last-mile delivery: Owned Infrastructure vs. the Gig Economy QUOTES 07:50 Perfecting hyperlocal delivery opened up national markets for Trexity - Alok: \\\"We started out empowering your favorite store on your favorite street of your favorite neighborhood. The local mom and pop. And on of the things that was really important to us when we started out, we said, let's be the true last mile partner. The same day we pick it up, it's the same day we're going to drop it off, as fast as our merchants are willing to fulfill it, it's as fast as we will deliver it. And let this be the one thing that we do so perfectly well that no one else can touch us on it.\\\" 13:25 Owned-infrastructure and gig economy have their own pros and cons - Alok: \\\"It's not one or the other. Both of those FedEx models exist for a reason because there's an addressable market for both of them. And I don't think it has to be warehousing or direct from merchant. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

He has lived and worked in China, India, Africa, Saudi Arabia, Europe, and the United States. Brittain is a global strategy and supply chain consultant and a writer for Forbes and his own website, brittainladd.com.

I think what TikTok needs to do is, again, change how commerce is done on the platform. So I think what would be very interesting is if TikTok acquires Shopify, so where now I have Shopify, I have a Shopify storefront on TikTok, and so then what happens is I immediately see a video come across but it's a video from a storefront, and without having to go to a website, I see it, I buy it.

Edward shares the trends in supply chain he is observing today post-COVID and beyond. </p><p>From the way Amazon changed logistics forever and its effects in consumer expectations as a result, to the importance of remaining agile and how to do it, Edward takes a deep dive into how global supply chains will look like in the near future and how to maintain inventory to scale.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT EDWARD</strong></p><p>Edward Hertzman received a degree in economics from NYU and spent more than a decade working as a top executive for major sourcing companies all over the world, including Synergies Worldwide and Pearl Global. Hertzman sits on the Board for Delivering Good, a charitable organization that channels the resources of the fashion industry to those in need.</p><p>In 2009, in response to a need in the industry, he founded Sourcing Journal Online. With more than 75,000 subscribers, Sourcing Journal Online is the largest trade journal devoted to the sourcing apparel and textile industry supply chain in the world. </p><p>In August 2020, he was promoted to executive vice president of Fairchild Media, tasked with growing the businesses of all Fairchild Media titles in his new position, while continuing to lead the day-to-day operations at Sourcing Journal. He will also oversee the growth of Fairchild Media’s strategic content studio, bolstering the creation of engaging, interactive content to help industry partners stand out in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>07:07 DTC is dying and mergers are set to happen</li><li>13:08 Surviving devaluation and managing inventory for what's to come</li><li>20:23 Keeping sourcing lean and agile in fashion</li><li>25:23 Nearshoring and diversifying manufacturing and sourcing capabilities</li><li>30:22 Regulations and sharing the responsibility of sustainability in supply chain management</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p><strong>14:27 On pushing back on the growth-at-all-costs mindset, Edward says, </strong>\\\"Just don't acquire customers saying, <i>Oh, the lifetime value is X </i>and never really realize that. Don't buy inventory without testing the product. Find retail partners that are gonna support you, not just be transactional.\\\"</p><p><strong>31:09 As regulations will push for tangible sustainability measures from retail, Edward says, </strong>\\\"I think there's only two ways to incentivize people or two ways to get people to change. One is through incentive and one is through repercussions. And what I mean by that is either you're gonna pay me more to do something or you're gonna punish me for not doing it.\\\"</p><p><strong>39:48 To survive the recession, Edward suggests, </strong>\\\"I think that if people don't think short term, the same way I say don't buy a million T-shirts when you really only need five. Don't just start laying off to make the quarter. It's very hard to find talent in this space. Don't stop investing in technology to make the quarter because you're gonna need that technology.\\\"</p><p> </p><p>Find out more about <strong>Edward </strong>and <strong>Sourcing Journal </strong>in the links below:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-hertzman-2401b38/\\\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-hertzman-2401b38/</a></li><li>Twitter: <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/EdwardHertzman\\\">https://twitter.com/EdwardHertzman</a></li><li>Instagram: <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/edwardhertzman/\\\">https://www.instagram.com/edwardhertzman/</a></li><li>Website: <a href=\\\"https://sourcingjournal.com/\\\">https://sourcingjournal.com/</a></li></ul> <p><p><strong>Subscribe and Keep Learning!</strong></p><p>If you’re a logistics leader looking to scale sustainably, don’t miss out!

And when fulfillment providers cannot keep up with brand growth, it can significantly affect customer experience, NPS scores, returns, and refund rates, to name a few. This is why merchants need to focus on building relationships instead of just working with their service providers. As Ninaad, Dan and Andrew discuss, building confidence on both sides includes having accurate invoicing and forecasting, thorough node strategy planning, and even in-person visits. </p><p>Why is this important?

For years, the modes of operations have become wasteful and make it harder to compete with giants with hyper-scale abilities. Shekar explains how the supply chain isn't your competitive advantage. But before we can dive into the solutions proposed by Shekar, we must reflect on the problem. As Shekar explains, the current state of the supply chain isn't built to help the mid-level brands scale. As they simply can't leverage the same level of assets and resources, hypergiants like Walmart and Amazon can. <br /> <br />Why is this important? Because when Walmart moves 50 million units per day versus AEO's 225 million, it's hard to compete, thereby demolishing the mid-level market.

<p><strong>ABOUT THE GUEST:</strong></p><p>Bill Gibson is a seasoned executive in the technology and supply chain industries.He earned his MBA from the University of Virginia's Darden School of

- \\\"How do you not have your real-time fulfillment system tied into your front-end commerce system?If you can’t supply the order, why are you booking the business?\\\"– Bill Gibson</p><p>[00:22:00] - \\\"The future is about how we as practitioners make it easier, faster, and less expensive to achieve the outcomes.It’s not just about the software, it’s about aligning strategy and operations.\\\"– Bill Gibson</p><p>[00:25:00] - \\\"We’re co-creating.It’s not about the AI toolkit, it’s about how we apply AI to solve real problems in commerce.\\\"– Bill Gibson</p><p>[00:36:00] – “In logistics, the digital and physical sides of the business need to be joined at the hip.When they’re not, you get failures that damage customer trust.”– Ninaad Acharya</p><p><strong>FIND MORE ABOUT THE

this episode, <strong>Simon Kalouche</strong>, founder and CEO of Nimble, joins the hosts to discuss the future of ecommerce logistics and the role of automation and robotics.Simon emphasizes the importance of automating core warehouse processes while acknowledging the challenges of handling edge cases.He shares his background in robotics and the application of deep learning in the field.Simon also highlights the potential of gecko adhesive technology for gripping and handling objects in logistics.The conversation explores the need for warehouses designed for robots and the vision of creating fully autonomous warehouses.Simon concludes by emphasizing the value of human involvement in the evolving landscape of ecommerce logistics.</p><p><br /> </p><p><strong>ABOUT SIMON</strong></p><p>Simon founded Nimble in 2017 after dropping out of his PhD at Stanford.He's spent the last 5 years inventing and scaling intelligent next-gen autonomous logistics systems.Previously Simon led development of dynamic legged robots for the Department of Defense while completing his masters in robotics at Carnegie Mellon, International Space Station robots for NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab and autonomous off-road vehicles for the Air Force Research Lab.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong><br /><br />If you try to automate all the one-offs, your warehouse will end up costing way too much.</p><p>There's always edge cases and one-off things you have to solve for in logistics.</p><p>Deep Imitation Learning allows robots to learn tasks through human demonstration.</p><p>Designing warehouses conducive to robots opens up new possibilities for automation.</p><p>The future of ecommerce logistics lies in a balance between automation and human involvement.</p><p><br /> </p><p>QUOTES</p><p><br /> </p><p>Real-World Automation Strategist, Variability Management Specialist.Simon: “I saw an opportunity to deploy this in the real world.There are so many monotonous, repetitive tasks out in the real world that are, you know, that are very repetitive, but yet too hard to automate because there's a lot of variability involved.And eCommerce to film is a classic example, right?If you think about a warehouse.You know, all day long is picking and packing and picking and packing.Uh, but the part that makes that task hard to automate is that you could be picking and packing 10 million or 20 million different objects, right?And every object has a different size and shape and weight and texture and stiffness and something you're fragile.”</p><p><br />Labor Optimization, Warehouse Automation.Simon: “Running a warehouse today is very hard because of the labor problem, right?The, it's, it's very hard to find, to recruit, to

operational rigor to execute but recognize difficulties - Joe: \\\"I said before, fulfillment's hard.It is just an underrated, really difficult task to pull off because you are dealing with very large

episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Kevin Lawton, Founder of The New Warehouse.Today, he talks about the innovations that are starting to take over warehousing operations today.</p><p>Kevin shares how he started his podcast and how the warehousing space has changed over time with the emergence of technology.From AI and computer vision being utilized in training to more practical applications on the job.He also discusses how he got into the micro-fulfillment space and what he expects moving forward.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT KEVIN</strong></p><p>Kevin has been involved in the distribution industry for 11 years, primarily focusing on inventory control.He started The New Warehouse Podcast in 2019 with over 350 episodes published.He is also an adjunct professor in supply chain at Rider University.</p><p>He has grown The New Warehouse into a 3PL services business with a recently opened Micro-fulfillment center in Philadelphia.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>02:28 How Kevin started <i>The New Warehouse </i>podcast</li><li>11:22 Understanding demographic replacement today</li><li>15:55 Using technology for warehouse training and operations</li><li>26:52 What excites Kevin about the micro-fulfillment space</li><li>35:45 Observable changes in micro-fulfillment over the years</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p><strong>21:10 Using virtual reality for warehouse training - Kevin:</strong> \\\"I love the training stuff just with the safety aspect overall.Training in the warehouse should be the same every time.I think programs like that allow you to do that same type of training every time.</p><p><strong>24:07 Any tools that help understand what's happening in the warehouse are extremely impactful - Kevin:</strong> \\\"When you think about reducing staff by bringing in automation and robotics and just having member shortages in general with less people wanting to work in warehouses.Think about 4-5 managers having to cover half a million square feet, you can't be everywhere at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>Find out more about Kevin in the links

an SME to help drive the product roadmap and support our global sales teams.He keeps a strong pulse on industry trends and frequently solicits customer and partner’s feedback on the technology investments that they are making to help inform and advance FourKite’s innovation with a customer-first mindset.He represents FourKites at industry events and briefings.Prior to FourKites, Mark was a Retail Industry Principal at Zebra Technologies where he led customer briefings, met with the press and analysts and worked with their Ventures organization evaluating potential investments.Mark has more than 20 years of experience in the retail industry and has worked with most large retailers globally.Before joining Zebra, Mark held leadership roles at Nielsen and General Mills and owned his own retail technology and analytics consulting firm.Mark holds a BS in Marketing from SUNY Oswego and serves on several boards in his community.He is also the mayor of a village on the north shore of Long Island where he and his family live.HIGHLIGHTS 01:40 Mark's 20-year journey in the logistics space.04:16 Is same-day or two-day delivery really necessary?10:09 Driving value and achieving the experience that customers demand.17:16 There's a lot more willingness to share data now.21:46 Employee satisfaction is now top of mind for many.26:25 What's happening in the robotics space?31:31 The role of labor market push in bringing in automation QUOTES 13:41 Visibility and transparency help you make sure consumer expectations are met - Mark: \\\"You need to have that level of accuracy at the store because otherwise, you have a consumer who now jumped in their car, drove 10 minutes away, walked in the store, now you've given them a terrible experience.Now because that loyalty's been shattered, there's a very good chance they're going to go across the street to your competitor.\\\"21:56 The importance of listening to consumers and customers - Mark: \\\"One other area that's top of mind with our customers these days is employee satisfaction.Because it's very expensive to lose a good employee, especially someone who's been there for a period of time and you've invested in all that training.For them to be mired down by spreadsheets and phone calls and all that, if you can give them that visibility and confidence that they're communicating something that's accurate, they feel better as associates.\\\"\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"jgS/waC4+M73cGAnBnmrVkOUFgwg3oPYt/922Ww8g8A=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6225021e-3070-4973-86e5-cf8761d9fbe2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6225021e-3070-4973-86e5-cf8761d9fbe2\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/8VMlhZbS\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"e2fb0b30-e415-4b38-8767-200c46337b30\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/8VMlhZbS\"},\"hash\":\"Ou2PMRlSW3rWzt3Fb6NqVKmn/9AgeqfcxztDerHPCqo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"0f9fc469-8cce-4cab-a6bf-a9d4e4a455e4\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/8VMlhZbS\"},\"hash\":\"0xMirX/Is2NDtNT67CTzCXT0VtTH2iykyi6KLvmOHPI=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"eaab680e-9428-4fcb-a610-afe3d2097b8e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"RPGNvogEo+MytqLiEmgVWB4h9ErtBTQXmj7FnoWCA44=\"}},\"text\":\"Now

pandemic 14:51 The bullwhip effect in retail supply chain recently 21:05 Can we expect more automation and robotics in warehousing?27:07 Don't try to match what Amazon is doing 34:24 Will there be conflict in CPG when working with consumers and being a direct-to-consumer brand?QUOTES 16:58 Don't diversify only when there are issues - Sucharita: \\\"One of the things we learned from the pandemic was that maybe we are too concentrated with our supply chains in Asia, particularly in China, then you add on some of the geopolitical issues.I think companies are gradually recognizing that maybe they do need to diversify their supply chains.But it's a painful decision to have to make because then you have to increase the costs of your inputs.\\\"27:07 Look inward instead of trying to compete with top players like Amazon - Sucharita: \\\"I think that the companies that created a lot of the frenzy around shipping were the ones that fundamentally didn't really have differentiated offerings.They were selling the same things Amazon is selling and net-net all being equal, if you are slower than Amazon, you have the same products, and you're not even pricing better, you really don't have a choice but to either lower your prices or increase your speed of shipping.\\\"Find out more about Sucharita in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sucharitamulpuru/

Elyassi-Rad</title>\\n<description>\\n<![CDATA[ <p>For this episode of the eCom Logistics Podcast, we welcome Patrick Nikoletich and Nima Elyassi-Rad, the CTO and the Vice President of Global Business Development of Shippo respectively.We sit with the amazing duo to talk about understanding fulfillment from different perspectives, creating a great delivery experience, and the innovations shaping the space for businesses and consumers alike.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT PATRICK AND NIMA</strong></p><p>Patrick is a technology executive and founder.He currently serves as the Chief Technology Officer at Shippo managing both product and engineering organizations.Previously, he served as the VP of Product at Truveta focused on developing AI/ML applications to improve the outcomes of patients receiving treatments, at Microsoft in Azure and AI & Research divisions as an engineering and program manager, and working for and leading small businesses developing applications with larger enterprises.In his spare time he enjoys skiing, riding motorcyles and hiking in the Pacific Northwest with his wife and two dogs.</p><p>Nima, on the other hand, is a technology executive, investor, and founder.He currently serves as the VP of Business Development at Shippo.Previously, he started a soccer brand, spent time as a VC, knows how to sling pizza, and put in time on the 1st and 2s as a Hip Hop radio DJ.</p><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><ul><li>02:25 Logistics from a cost and customer experience perspective</li><li>09:25 You don't need to have an Amazon-like delivery experience especially early on.</li><li>15:14 Many copycat brands will start going away.</li><li>21:13 Innovations and their practical applications in the eCom space today.</li></ul><p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p><p>03:53 Any warehouse shipper has to consider someone to be their infrastructure - Nima: \\\"Tech forward folks don't like it, you come for the integration and you stay for the switching cost because it's too expensive to rip something out.But in reality, things are breaking down.So when you are picking a new partner, I think it's important to really vet them to understand are they enterprise-ready and what that readiness means for your organization.\\\"</p><p>23:12 AI and ML applications have been \\\"invading\\\" everyone's lives for many years - Patrick: \\\"The thing that you have to recognize is that 85-90% of ideas around AI and ML applications will probably fail, they won't return any meaningful value and won't be used as

from being part of the Marine Corps to now leading businesses in the supply chain side.</p><p>Prashant talks about what he learned in the military that has transitioned through the supply chain and logistics side of his career today.He also shares insights on driving growth while also making sure to reduce costs at the same time.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT PRASHANT</strong></p><p>Prashant Shah, who joined SwagUp in 2021 runs Supply Chain as the Chief Supply Chain Officer, based in Piscataway, New Jersey.Prashant joins SwagUp with 17 years of senior level management experience in Supply Chain.He was born and raised in India, and came to the USA in 2001.He started his studies in engineering but quickly found his way into the United States Marine Corps office a day after 9/11 to serve his country against terrorism.He served 8 years in the Marines and was medically discharged due to injuries in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p>After his medical discharge from the Marines in 2009, he returned to New Jersey and started working in Target as an unloader in the overnight shift while trying to finish his Bachelor's in Criminal Justice.In 2010, after graduating, he became a Sales-floor Executive at Target which led to his promotion to Sr.Logistic Executive in Jersey City, New Jersey Target location.Following from Target, he soon landed a role at the largest Macy’s Distribution Center and moved up the rank of Director of the Distribution Center in a unionized environment and successfully led 200+ members to the best-engaged building in the country.This was when Prashant tasted the success of being a leader in the distribution and logistics role and found his real passion in the supply chain world.</p><p>From this moment, the sky was the limit and he worked in Bed Bath and Beyond, Drive Medical and Lasership as Head of Supply Chain.In his current role in SwagUp, his vision while it aligns with CEO and Founder of SwagUp, Michael Martocci, is to become a $1Billon company within 5

different cultures, backgrounds, ethnicities, and so for.That really preps them for the camaraderie piece because you're literally having your life put in somebody's hands and you have each other's back.\\\"</p><p>Going from zero to ninety-nine is tremendous, especially with personnel - Prashant: \\\"If we want to get to 99-100%, then I will need additional individuals.But who is going to volunteer to go to Afghanistan and stay with me for 6 months?So getting to the preparation, we need to be 100% so that way we don't need additional personnel so they can be used somewhere else.The mindset is we don't have anybody, that's all you have.Whatever you see, that's it.\\\"</p><p> </p><p>Find out more about <strong>Prashant</strong> in the links below:</p><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a

strategic roles that regional and national carriers have been playing for the last 10 or so years.ABOUT BEN Co-Founder and CEO of Tusk.Ben has spent his career at the overlap of small parcel shipping and ecommerce and led operations and strategic partnerships at Google Shopping and Shippo before building Tusk.Having seen the small parcel industry from many angles — as an operator, software

every shipper out there to call a regional.The reason being is, because their op is smaller their operation is often more flexible.For example, if you have 25 pieces bound for a regional's footprint,

lifting of e-commerce so our clients can focus on what they do best.\\\"26:10 Your core values will enable technical competencies - Dusty: \\\"There are certain core values that are absolute buzz saws.And if you run into that one, it's a buzz saw.You're not gonna make it here if you just don't believe that.So looking for people that are core-value-focused, are people-focused, they understand that what we do is done through the hard work of people, who have a get-stuff-done bias or just GSD, it was get it done, and are client-centric.So it was kind of four big buckets of things that I'm looking for that transcends or enables technical competency.\\\"Find out more about Dusty in the links below: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustyholcomb/ Website:

partner network of other mid-sized to large independent storage operators.</p><p>This network allowed them to source storage for their customers from 12,000 different locations.In order to make this process more efficient, they also developed RFID technology to help manage the process and provide real-time updates on inventory.</p><p>Steven, along with Dan and Ninaad, also discusses the Amazon Effect, how consumer expectations have changed due to this, what brands and logistics companies must do to keep up, and the various factors that influence if and when they should match this speed of fulfillment.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT STEVEN</strong></p><p>Steven Ciemcioch was named President of Warehouse Anywhere, a Life Storage Company, in 2018 and previously served as Corporate Alliance

Trexity.Being the true last mile partner where orders are delivered the same day they pick it up has been the goal of Alok's company.They wanted to be hyperlocal and empower local SMBs to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world.Alok digs into why different last-mile solutions exist to address the needs of different types of buyers.He also explains that, given their low barrier for entry, that local shops can be given a low risk alternative to see how they can offer a comparable solution to Amazon and grow their business.ABOUT ALOK Alok has over 15 years in software, technology and e-commerce.Along with his co-founders, Alok has created a platform, in Trexity, that makes it possible for any small business to deliver quickly and locally.Alok is a serial entrepreneur who encourages and supports like-minded individuals to succeed in their business.Alok began imagining a platform that could make it possible for any small business to deliver local and fast, and one that is fair and takes advantage of neither merchants nor couriers.He believes that filling this need will help disrupt our over-reliance on faraway e-commerce giants and help small businesses stay in business.HIGHLIGHTS 01:20 Alok's early exposure to business and his passion for technology 06:01 Perfecting last-mile, hyperlocal delivery for SMBs 12:38 The future of last-mile delivery: Owned

Brittain Ladd, Strategy Advisor Shatranj Capital Partners.Brittain's no-holds-barred insights on management and logistics have not only captured people's attention, but they have also even proven to be accurate given how many of his predictions have come true.He discusses some of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, Twitter, and TikTok, and gives hot takes on what they are doing wrong and how they can make it right.He comments on the recent layoffs at Amazon and how he believes it is only the beginning and a symptom of a much larger shift that will affect entire industries worldwide.Brittain then digs into how partnerships can change e-commerce by providing social commerce platforms the established fulfillment infrastructure they need to deliver goods to the consumer.He also discusses in great detail the flaws of the quick commerce model and how fulfillment should be a question of accurate delivery versus quick delivery.ABOUT BRITTAIN Brittain has 20 years of experience in supply chain management and logistics.He has lived and worked in China, India, Africa, Saudi Arabia, Europe, and the United States.Brittain is a global strategy and supply chain consultant and a writer for Forbes and his own website, brittainladd.com.Brittain is also recognized as being one of the most accurate analysts in business.He successfully predicted multiple major acquisitions more than a year in advance of them occurring, including Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods, Microsoft and Walmart partnering to bid on TikTok, and most recently, Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.Brittain is frequently quoted in the press and often appears on major news networks like CNN, Fox Business, and the BBC.HIGHLIGHTS - 01:37 i get a lot - Posting thought-provoking ideas and predictions on social media - 08:52 what type of - Amazon's mistake and getting down to its optimal fighting weight - 18:47 let's talk about - Twitter can change e-commerce with shoppable videos - 25:43 I've had people - Instead of creating their own fulfillment, TiktTok should partner with Amazon/Walmart/Target/Shopify - 35:42 i'd love to - Quick commerce is a failure: Fast delivery vs accurate delivery QUOTES 23:51 Shoppable videos can save Twitter - Brittain: \\\"I believe the way that Elon Musk saves Twitter and makes Twitter completely different is through shippable videos and, I think, absolutely, that what Elon Mush should be doing is we need short-form videos, shoppable videos, and for every shoppable video we put on Twitter, we take 12% of all sales, and I think the goal should be for every shoppable video that Elon Musk puts on Twitter, that it generates 100 to 250 million in sales.\\\"25:50 TikTok should acquire Shopify for its fulfillment infrastructure - Brittain: \\\"I think, number one, TikTok needs to do something above and beyond than just opening up their own fulfillment centers.I think what TikTok needs to do is, again, change how commerce is done on the platform.So I think what would be very interesting is if TikTok acquires Shopify, so where now I have Shopify, I have a Shopify storefront on TikTok, and so then what happens is I immediately see a video come across but it's a video from a storefront, and without having to go to a website, I see it, I buy it.And that's how I refer to what I think is the

transactional.\\\"</p><p><strong>31:09 As regulations will push for tangible sustainability measures from retail, Edward says, </strong>\\\"I think there's only two ways to incentivize people or two ways to get people to change.One is through incentive and one is through repercussions.And what I mean by that is either you're gonna pay me more to do something or you're gonna punish me for not doing it.\\\"</p><p><strong>39:48 To survive the recession, Edward suggests, </strong>\\\"I think that if people don't think short term, the same way I say don't buy a million T-shirts when you really only need five.Don't just start laying off to make the quarter.It's very hard to find talent in this space.Don't stop investing in technology to make the quarter because you're gonna need that

can initiate to begin cartonization, as well as raises awareness of the gravity of the waste issue worldwide.HIGHLIGHTS 02:58 Cartonization: Packing mistakes and the factors that drive them 14:59 Amazon packing practices are practical but waste is a major issue 18:59 Cartonizing realizes hidden savings per square foot 28:47 Lead the shift because the waste problem needs to be resolved QUOTES

you at least some of the way there to get you started and help you keep your margins intact.\\\"27:04 The data proves that the waste problem is much more significant - James: \\\"My team is very motivated by this idea that we could put a dent in some of the waste in supply chain.And I think it's kind of a rude awakening, a little bit, when you start digging into the data of how bad things
