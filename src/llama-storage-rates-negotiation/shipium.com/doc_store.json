Between the need for faster deliveries, fluctuating carrier costs, and unprecedented network complexity, keeping costs down is much easier said than done. \\nWe’ve offered insights on several different ways to do this in the past by leveraging predictive analytics, modernizing shipping technology, and finding more opportunities to use economy service methods.\\nIn this post, we’ll explore how you can begin to find cost savings early in the parcel fulfillment process so you can make smarter decisions throughout the rest of the lifecycle.\\nExample Parcel Fulfillment Workflow\\nFirst, let’s establish an example of an end-to-end parcel fulfillment workflow to provide alignment on what we mean by “upstream.” Yours will likely vary from this in some way, but by capturing common steps, we can identify cost optimization strategies that are broadly applicable early in the process. \\nHere’s what the workflow looks like and a brief overview of the steps involved:\\nOrder placement: A customer places an order through one of your sales channels, and the fulfillment process is initiated.\\nOrder routing: At this stage, you (the shipper) will decide when you need to ship an order for it to arrive when your customer expects it to, and where the best origin to ship from is. In short, you’ll develop a fulfillment plan for the order.\\nOrder fulfillment: This is typically where you’ll pick, pack, and process your order based on the routing instructions and decisions from the previous stage. A label is created, and the order is registered for track-and-trace.\\nTracking & monitoring: Occurs once the parcel leaves your warehouse/FC and enters a carrier’s network. The shipment is continuously monitored, providing visibility to both you and your end customer.\\nContinuous improvement: After the order has been fulfilled, the data collected throughout the process is analyzed to make process improvements that improve either performance, costs, or both. Factors to focus on include carrier performance, ship dates, packaging used etc.\\nOne of the more unique ways that Shipium creates value is by helping to reduce costs at the point of order placement. The platform enables you to find value throughout the process — examples include consolidating tracking updates to reduce development costs and enabling you to efficiently run simulations to find cost saving opportunities that you may have missed. But, for the purposes of this post, we’ll focus on the order placement stage, because it’s an area that our customers typically didn’t look for cost savings previously.\\n\\nEnterprises can leverage Shipium to find upstream cost savings through early address validation, packaging optimization and consolidation, and smarter shipment timing.\\n\\nLet’s explore each in detail.\\nAddress validation\\nIncorrect addresses contribute to excess shipping costs in several ways. Incorrect deliveries caused by missing details, non-standard formats, or even typos lead to failed deliveries and returned shipments. This creates both re-shipping and return fees, which quickly add up if you don’t have a strategy for preventing them. In many cases, carriers may also charge an address correction fees if provided with the wrong zip code, missing suite numbers, or incomplete addresses.\\n\\nAdditionally, misclassification between residential and commercial addresses often incur carrier surcharges. By validating the type of destination up-front, shippers can avoid residential surcharges from being applied to commercial deliveries, or vice versa. \\n\\nShipium’s Address Validation API offers a quick way to address these challenges. Shippers simply need to pass common address fields like the street, city, state, address type etc. to receive a response that designates the address as being either valid or invalid. The API response will also include additional information such as whether the address provided is a PO box, as well as details on why an address is invalid so that errors can be corrected.\\nPackaging optimization\\nChoosing the right packaging for order SKUs is another important cost-saving measure. Without the right packaging, you’re likely to incur excessive dimweight charges given that carriers calculate costs based on package dimensions. Using the smallest box/package that’ll get the job done ensures that you’ll be charged the appropriate amount. \\n\\nThe right packaging also enables order consolidation, which means you don’t need to pay for multiple packages and shipments. \\n\\nOrganizations using Shipium’s Package Planner API can quickly receive packaging recommendations early in the fulfillment process by using estimates (rather than waiting to gather exact weights & dimensions during packout). This allows them to make the right packaging decisions upstream and consolidate orders whenever possible (and perform rate selection, which is helpful if they’re looking to offer rates directly in a cart). \\nShipment timing\\nTiming when a shipment should be dropped to a facility for processing and packout is essential — when shippers get this wrong, it leads to excess costs in a few ways. \\n\\nIf a shipment is dropped to a facility too late, you’ll likely need to pay for premium carrier service methods (same day, next day etc.) to make sure that it meets the delivery date that was presented to your customer at checkout. By contrast, dropping shipments too early leads to excess holding costs. \\n\\nIt’s also worth mentioning that timing shipments correctly can help to manage carrier costs. You can avoid peak demand periods (holidays, end of week rushes) and align with cutoff schedules to ensure that your packages leave on time and can be delivered using ground methods. \\n\\nBy passing a customer’s postal and country codes as well as your desired delivery date to Shipium’s Shipment Timing API, you’ll receive recommendations on when an order should be dropped to a facility and the date it should be shipped by. \\nWrapping up\\nWhen considering how to reduce shipping costs, many enterprise shippers are missing opportunities to do so early in the process. Much of what you’re doing later in the process — for example, rate shopping across multiple carriers — can be brought upstream to ensure that every aspect of your workflow is as cost-efficient as possible. \\n\\nShipium can help to further optimize the process by either enabling or simplifying these cost saving measures through our flexible and highly responsive APIs.

To take control and manage costs, you need to implement a robust parcel strategy designed to streamline your processes.\\nThis guide explores the importance of parcel shipping optimization and presents practical strategies to help improve your current approach.\\nWhat is parcel delivery optimization?\\nParcel delivery optimization is a method of improving the efficiency and — more importantly — the reliability of your overall shipping process, from initial carrier selection to final delivery. Combining strategic planning with the right technology can enhance your fulfillment performance and save money.\\nKey business outcomes of optimized shipping\\nBy working toward an optimized shipping process, you can: \\nReduce operational costs through better routing, lower fuel consumption, and better resource utilization\\nIncrease profitability with improved spending control across shipping operations\\nBoost customer satisfaction through faster shipping, better tracking, and proactive issue resolution\\nStrengthen ecommerce supply chain performance with lower inventory levels and shorter cash cycles\\nGain competitive advantage through superior service levels and scalable operations\\nKey components of streamlined parcel shipment \\nBefore exploring strategies for parcel shipping optimization, let’s take a closer look at the common elements found in mature fulfillment processes:\\nRobust carrier management\\nYour network is only as efficient as the providers within it. One of the most important steps toward delivery efficiency is implementing a multi-carrier solution designed to handle contract management, reduce manual decision-making, and improve fulfillment. \\nSuccessful carrier management requires:\\nEnhanced selection efficiency: Evaluate shipping providers based on cost, reliability, and service coverage to build an optimal mix for your delivery network.\\nFavorable pricing: Apply volume data and performance metrics to negotiate contracts that align with your shipping patterns.\\nStrategic relationships: Maintain open communication channels with carriers and review performance tracking to ensure reliable capacity and performance standards.\\nA solution like Shipium can manage your shipping network and improve per-package carrier selection, helping speed up operations and increase profits. For example, when Saks expanded beyond a single provider to a diverse carrier network that included regional last-mile services using our platform, three-day deliveries became more cost-effective than slower shipping options.\\nIntelligent packaging optimization\\nWhether your boxes have excess space or poorly packed shipments result in damaged products, not having well-defined cartonization strategies impacts your bottom line and enhances customer satisfaction.\\nA strong strategy should prioritize:\\nReducing dimensional weight charges: Design packaging strategies that minimize wasted space while maintaining product protection during transit.\\nStreamlining order grouping: Analyze order patterns to combine or split shipments based on cost efficiency and delivery speed requirements.\\nLeading WMS platforms like Manhattan and Blue Yonder include built-in cartonization modules to optimize package sizing at the warehouse level. However, adopting an advanced platform like Shipium enhances the functionality of your systems. With the Packaging Planner API, for instance, you can extend your package planning capabilities upstream, enabling better decision-making before routing orders.\\nEfficient shipment routing\\nYour parcel shipment operations can become more productive if your systems intelligently route your orders to ensure products are sent to customers from the closest locations, significantly reducing transit times and increasing profit margins. \\nA comprehensive routing process should:\\nDesign optimal delivery paths: Create routes based on destination zones, service levels, and carrier capabilities to minimize transit time and costs.\\nLeverage routing tools: Apply advanced algorithms and real-time data to select the best shipping lanes for each order.\\nAdapt to changing conditions: Monitor and adjust routing decisions based on weather, capacity constraints, and other macro-environmental factors affecting delivery.\\nIt's important to bridge your existing systems to ensure you make the best decisions when managing your orders. A software solution like Shipium's Fulfillment Engine, for example, uses advanced machine learning to manage and direct orders appropriately, minimizing shipping expenses while maximizing delivery speed and accuracy.\\nStrategic shipping technology integration\\nModernizing your current shipping process requires the right technology stack. This stack should promote automation whenever possible and use cloud-based infrastructure to reduce development lead time and budget.  \\nEssential technology components include:\\nDeploying comprehensive shipping software: Adopt platforms that centralize carrier management, eliminate routine manual activities, and provide real-time visibility across operations.\\nApplying predictive analytics: Use historical shipping data and market trends to forecast demand, fine-tune inventory levels, and plan carrier capacity needs.\\nAutomating fulfillment choices: Apply rules-based logic and machine learning to make instant routing choices based on service levels and cost parameters.\\nExplore how predictive analytics can improve your ability to make strategic supply chain decisions.\\nHow to optimize your parcel shipping strategies for cost and efficiency\\nHere are five tactical and strategic improvements that you can implement to help enhance your current parcel shipping strategy: \\nEnhance your rate shopping \\n\\nEffective, automated rate shopping ensures that your business consistently selects the most economical delivery options. To improve your current process, consider:\\nUsing real-time comparison tools: Access instant multi-carrier quotes to make quick, informed decisions on parcel shipments based on current prices.\\nConducting accurate cost analysis: Gather complete costs — including surcharges and accessorials — to better understand and compare carrier charges.\\nImproving service level selection: Balance shipping costs against delivery requirements to meet both budget constraints and customer expectations.\\nDiscover how fully loaded rate shopping maximizes your cost savings.\\n  Consolidate your shipments \\n\\nStrategic consolidation can transform shipping efficiency. Properly combining shipments increases delivery density while reducing handling points and product damage. Here's how to approach it:\\nBuild order groups: Combine multiple orders by destination to reduce per-package costs while maintaining delivery speed requirements.\\nLeverage zone skipping methods: Use regional carriers and strategic routing to bypass shipping zones and reduce long-distance transportation costs.\\nDistribute your inventory: Place your stock across your warehouses strategically to minimize shipping zones and improve delivery times across your network.\\nSee how last-mile delivery can impact your bottom-line shipping expenses.\\nAutomate your fulfillment processes \\n\\nManual tasks create bottlenecks and increase error rates in shipping operations. A well-designed strategy connects systems and streamlines workflows to:\\nSimplify order workflows: Automate routine fulfillment activities from order receipt to delivery to reduce manual intervention and processing time.\\nIntegrate warehouse systems: Connect your Order Management System (OMS) and Warehouse Management System platforms to ensure seamless data flow and eliminate information silos.\\nEnhance operational efficiency: Implement intelligent sorting and packaging systems to increase accuracy and throughput in your operations.\\nIncrease your delivery options and flexibility\\n\\nToday's customers expect shipping choices that match their specific needs — and not meeting those expectations can lead to negative reviews and lost sales. Consider applying the following improvements to your parcel strategy:\\nExpand delivery options: Offer multiple shipping speeds from same-day to standard delivery to match varying customer needs and budgets.\\nGenerate accurate estimates: Create precise timelines using actual time carrier data and historical performance metrics.\\nOffer flexible pickup: Provide customers with convenient alternatives like secure lockers and delivery to retail locations to improve satisfaction.\\nShippers often avoid economy services for time-sensitive deliveries without reliable insights, defaulting to more expensive options. Software that properly reviews performance data can power more informed shipping method selection. For example, our dynamic Time-in-Transit Model analyzes historical performance to identify when economy services can reliably keep delivery promises, helping you reduce shipping costs.\\nImprove your order tracking and communication\\n\\nTransparent status notifications create confident customers and reduce support queries. End-to-end visibility transforms the post-purchase experience by:\\nBoosting tracking visibility: Provide real-time parcel shipment location and updates as orders move through your supply chain.\\nSending proactive alerts: Notify customers about shipping milestones and potential delays to manage delivery expectations.\\nEasing returns management: Simplify the returns process with easy label generation and convenient dropoff options to improve the customer experience.\\nMany businesses struggle with communication due to gaps between operational systems and customer-facing platforms. Solutions like Shipium integrate your shipping data with your customer delivery experience, ensuring buyers receive accurate updates throughout their experience.\\nBest practices for optimizing parcel delivery\\nSuccessful shipping strategies are never set-it-and-forget-it. Instead, they require you to pay attention to key performance drivers, proactively making improvements to maintain maximum efficiency. \\nFocus your optimization efforts on these proven approaches:\\nParcel delivery best practices\\nHow the best practices work\\nExamples of parcel shipping optimization\\nFacilitate data-driven planning\\nAnalyze shipping patterns and performance metrics to refine carrier selection and routing decisions\\nUsing historical delivery data to shift regional volume to better-performing carriers\\nEnsure peak season preparation\\nEstablish surge protocols, backup carriers, and flexible routing before high-volume periods\\nAdding additional regional carriers during Black Friday week to maintain delivery standards\\nMeasure your KPIs to improve performance\\nTrack critical metrics like per-parcel cost, on-time delivery, and exception rates to drive improvements\\nMonitoring dimensional weight utilization to identify packaging optimization opportunities\\nSimplify and refine your parcel strategy with Shipium \\nWith Shipium’s end-to-end platform, you can connect your OMS and WMS solutions to streamline and enhance your fulfillment — reducing transit times, improving accuracy, and reducing your parcel spend by up to 10% on average.\\n\\nBook a demo today and see how Shipium powers parcel shipping optimization.\\nKris Gösser\\nCMO\\nDiagonal thinker who enjoys hard problems of any variety.

Legacy tech and DIY internal efforts simply don’t have the capabilities to send more volume to these services as a result.\\n\\nThe good news? One of the primary use cases for Shipium’s Dynamic Time-in-Transit Model is to create accurate EDDs for economy shipping methods, effectively enabling you to establish a dynamic SLA that’s backed by our machine learning models.\\n\\nIn this article, we’ll explain how you can leverage the insights provided by the Time-in-Transit Model to reduce costs through intelligent downgrades to economy shipping methods, unlock value with regional carriers, and more.\\nWhy Use Economy Shipping Methods?\\nBefore diving into the details of how Shipium can help you take greater advantage of economy shipping options, let’s review the reasons why you’d want to do so in the first place. While specific benefits can vary by use case, here are the general advantages of economy shipping.\\nIt’s a lower-cost option\\nThe most obvious reason to use economy service methods is that they’re cheaper on a per-unit basis — creating higher margins, or savings that you can pass on to customers or invest in other areas of the business.\\n\\nBeyond the direct reduction in shipping costs, it’s also worth mentioning that using economy shipping can improve your negotiating leverage for premium service options — more on this shortly.\\nScalable and sustainable market expansion\\nWhile there’s always a degree of investment when expanding to new geographies, economy shipping makes it possible to do so without significantly increasing costs. This helps to de-risk expansion efforts by limiting financial downside if the new market doesn’t pan out (ex. due to lack of demand). \\n\\nLimiting fulfillment costs while expanding to new markets can also enable you to offer more competitive pricing and attract price-sensitive customers — many of whom will become repeat shoppers.\\nGreater negotiating leverage\\nIn many situations (for example, being single-threaded with a carrier), you may not have the leverage to negotiate more favorable rates. Instead, to keep the delivery promise you’ve made to your customers, you often need to pay for premium shipping options that can guarantee delivery by a certain date. \\n\\nWhen it comes to negotiating discounts with a single carrier, being able to scalably leverage economy shipping can help to shift that paradigm. For example — if you can send more volume to UPS MI without impacting the customer experience, you may be able to leverage that to negotiate stronger volume discounts for UPS 5-Day Ground. \\n\\nHowever, as we mentioned earlier, economy shipping methods aren’t nearly as widely-used as they could be, despite these benefits. The reason is simple — on a risk-adjusted basis, it’s a smarter move to pay a premium for the sure thing than risk breaking your delivery promise to a customer. But what if you didn’t have to choose between breaking your promise and breaking the bank?\\nEnter Shipium’s Dynamic TNT Model\\nShipium’s Dynamic Time-in-Transit Model creates value throughout the supply chain, and is used for everything from providing accurate EDDs to building supply chain resilience. Our large pool of shipment data is analyzed by proprietary machine learning models to provide accurate and actionable insights related to your shipping strategy — in this case, specific to carrier performance.\\nThe Time-in-Transit model can analyze the performance of different carriers’ economy shipping methods, account for unique business rules (such as the required delivery date for an item), and help you uncover new opportunities to use economy shipping while delivering on customers’ expectations. \\nUse Cases\\nWhile there are many use cases and benefits associated with Shipium’s Dynamic Time-in-Transit Model, here are some that specifically relate to use of economy shipping methods:\\nIntelligent downgrades: If you haven’t negotiated favorable rates for premium service methods, you can use Dynamic TNT to establish SLAs for Economy Shipping methods and strategically downgrade where it’s appropriate. This also gives you more leverage when negotiating premium options, as carriers will know that you have a scalable, high-margin solution in place.\\nUnlocking value with regional carriers: As obvious as it sounds, the fact that regional carriers are optimized for their specific regions typically means they can offer more competitive rates and delivery estimates — Shipium can surface these carriers for you.\\nEfficient inventory management: Determine the most efficient place to store inventory, not based on just warehouse location but also historical carrier efficiency and performance. Run a smoother, more predictable inventory management operation.\\nEnhanced shopping experience: By leveraging Shipium’s Dynamic TNT, you can offer dynamic pricing (ex. offering free shipping for products with lower predicted TNT), provide accurate EDDs even for cheaper shipping options, and generally offer more options that appeal to price-sensitive and eager shoppers alike.\\nYou can also leverage this technology to quickly pivot shipments to new carriers when faced with disruptions, build reports on overall carrier performance, and offer “greener” shipping options, depending on your organization’s priorities. In any case, you can use Shipium to quickly find savings and improve the efficiency of your operations.\\nHow it works\\nShipium’s Time-in-Transit predictions are calculated by our powerful, proprietary machine learning models, which analyze a wide range of data gathered on transit, topology, and macro-conditions impacting shipping. The platform will also factor in any known carrier promotions or changes to default rates that could help to further lower costs.\\nIt’s important to note that recommended carriers and service options aren’t “one-size-fits-all” — you can input customer overrides to give our platform context unique to your business, such as discounts you’ve negotiated for specific shipping lanes or EDDs you’ve provided to your customers.\\n\\nOnce you’ve provided the necessary inputs, Shipium will surface the most efficient shipping lanes, carriers, and service methods for you to choose from. Your recommendations will follow a hierarchy based on the inputs you’ve provided, ordered by:\\nKnown customer overrides and unique business rules\\nShipium’s recommended options based on cost-effectiveness and predicted TNT\\nAny relevant carrier defaults or promotions that are cost-competitive\\nContinuous monitoring of supply chain performance enables you to analyze different TNT configurations so you can continue to make impactful improvements over time. \\n\\nFor more details, see our full documentation.\\nReal customer results\\nBy applying Shipium’s Dynamic TNT to search for feasible economy shipping methods, an enterprise clothing retailer determined that they could move $30M out of $180M in total shipments to economy shipping method based on the differences between Shipium’s predicted Time-in-Transit vs. carrier defaults — enabling them to intelligently downgrade.\\n\\nTheir CPP was reduced by $0.36, resulting in $29.6 million in savings.\\nWrapping up\\nShipium’s Dynamic Time-in-Transit Model can help you to scalably leverage economy shipping methods, downgrade from premium methods as appropriate, better leverage regional carriers with more competitive rates, and uncover new layers of savings within your shipping operations. \\nIf you’re looking for ways to strategically reduce shipping costs while continuing to honor your delivery promise, feel free to schedule a call with our team of experts to discuss your use case.\\n\\nAnurag Allena\\nProduct Marketing Lead\\nAnurag leads Shipium’s product marketing efforts, focused on helping the world understand how our platform adds incredible value for everyone.\\nSHARE\\nUpdated March 15, 2024\\nResources That Might Be Useful For You\\nNov 15, 2024\\nParcel Shipping Optimization: A Guide\\nKris Gösser\\nCMO\\nNov 15, 2024\\nKörber WMS: 7 Use Cases for Ecommerce Shipping Operations\\nKris Gösser\\nCMO\\nProduct\\nNov 08, 2024\\nHow a Carrier Management System Impacts Ecommerce Efficiency\\nKris Gösser\\nCMO\\nWant to see how Shipium works?\\nSchedule a demo.

Anurag Allena\\n|\\nUpdated September 26, 2024\\n|\\n5 min read\\nIn this article\\nExample Parcel Fulfillment Workflow\\nAddress validation\\nPackaging optimization\\nShipment timing\\nWrapping up\\nEnterprise shippers who are thinking about how to reduce shipping costs face an increasingly uphill battle.Between the need for faster deliveries, fluctuating carrier costs, and unprecedented network complexity, keeping costs down is much easier said than done.We’ve offered insights on several different ways to do this in the past by leveraging predictive analytics, modernizing shipping technology, and finding more opportunities to use economy service methods.In this post, we’ll explore how you can begin to find cost savings early in the parcel fulfillment process so you can make smarter decisions throughout the rest of the lifecycle.Example Parcel Fulfillment Workflow\\nFirst, let’s establish an example of an end-to-end parcel fulfillment workflow to provide alignment on what we mean by “upstream.”Yours will likely vary from this in some way, but by capturing common steps, we can identify cost optimization strategies that are broadly applicable early in the process.Here’s what the workflow looks like and a brief overview of the steps involved:\\nOrder placement: A customer places an order through one of your sales channels, and the fulfillment process is initiated.Order routing: At this stage, you (the shipper) will decide when you need to ship an order for it to arrive when your customer expects it to, and where the best origin to ship from is.In short, you’ll develop a fulfillment plan for the order.Order fulfillment: This is typically where you’ll pick, pack, and process your order based on the routing instructions and decisions from the previous stage.A label is created, and the order is registered for track-and-trace.Tracking & monitoring: Occurs once the parcel leaves your warehouse/FC and enters a carrier’s network.The shipment is continuously monitored, providing visibility to both you and your end customer.Continuous improvement: After the order has been fulfilled, the data collected throughout the process is analyzed to make process improvements that improve either performance, costs, or both.Factors to focus on include carrier performance, ship dates, packaging used etc.\\nOne of the more unique ways that Shipium creates value is by helping to reduce costs at the point of order placement.The platform enables you to find value throughout the process — examples include consolidating tracking updates to reduce development costs and enabling you to efficiently run simulations to find cost saving opportunities that you may have missed.But, for the purposes of this post, we’ll focus on the order placement stage, because it’s an area that our customers typically didn’t look for cost savings previously.Enterprises can leverage Shipium to find upstream cost savings through early address validation, packaging optimization and consolidation, and smarter shipment timing.Let’s explore each in detail.Address validation\\nIncorrect addresses contribute to excess shipping costs in several ways.Incorrect deliveries caused by missing details, non-standard formats, or even typos lead to failed deliveries and returned shipments.This creates both re-shipping and return fees, which quickly add up if you don’t have a strategy for preventing them.In many cases, carriers may also charge an address correction fees if provided with the wrong zip code, missing suite numbers, or incomplete addresses.Additionally, misclassification between residential and commercial addresses often incur carrier surcharges.By validating the type of destination up-front, shippers can avoid residential surcharges from being applied to commercial deliveries, or vice versa.Shipium’s Address Validation API offers a quick way to address these challenges.Shippers simply need to pass common address fields like the street, city, state, address type etc. to receive a response that designates the address as being either valid or invalid.The API response will also include additional information such as whether the address provided is a PO box, as well as details on why an address is invalid so that errors can be corrected.Packaging optimization\\nChoosing the right packaging for order SKUs is another important cost-saving measure.Without the right packaging, you’re likely to incur excessive dimweight charges given that carriers calculate costs based on package dimensions.Using the smallest box/package that’ll get the job done ensures that you’ll be charged the appropriate amount.The right packaging also enables order consolidation, which means you don’t need to pay for multiple packages and shipments.Organizations using Shipium’s Package Planner API can quickly receive packaging recommendations early in the fulfillment process by using estimates (rather than waiting to gather exact weights & dimensions during packout).\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"XB7fZ0dGAv/xPpqQJ8TjdI6Z8f7Kmx22dY6fZPRcq08=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ba63b8d9-8e72-4fb8-9522-8d0ae665ab5c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ba63b8d9-8e72-4fb8-9522-8d0ae665ab5c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipium.com/blog/how-to-reduce-shipping-costs-early-in-the-parcel-fulfillment-process-with-shipium\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"e745685e-2514-4460-b6cb-4facce4c2de8\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipium.com/blog/how-to-reduce-shipping-costs-early-in-the-parcel-fulfillment-process-with-shipium\"},\"hash\":\"9yXdHbcLpkaNT3yOuHemzBOdYsNppcUfpg7iqcuMCOA=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"50f83719-b2d1-4620-8cbc-06b550104d1f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipium.com/blog/how-to-reduce-shipping-costs-early-in-the-parcel-fulfillment-process-with-shipium\"},\"hash\":\"XB7fZ0dGAv/xPpqQJ8TjdI6Z8f7Kmx22dY6fZPRcq08=\"}},\"text\":\"Shippers

don’t need to pay for multiple packages and shipments.Organizations using Shipium’s Package Planner API can quickly receive packaging recommendations early in the fulfillment process by using estimates (rather than waiting to gather exact weights & dimensions during packout).This allows them to make the right packaging decisions upstream and consolidate orders whenever possible (and perform rate selection, which is helpful if they’re looking to offer rates directly in a cart).Shipment timing\\nTiming when a shipment should be dropped to a facility for processing and packout is essential — when shippers get this wrong, it leads to excess costs in a few ways.If a shipment is dropped to a facility too late, you’ll likely need to pay for premium carrier service methods (same day, next day etc.) to make sure that it meets the delivery date that was presented to your customer at checkout.By contrast, dropping shipments too early leads to excess holding costs.It’s also worth mentioning that timing shipments correctly can help to manage carrier costs.You can avoid peak demand periods (holidays, end of week rushes) and align with cutoff schedules to ensure that your packages leave on time and can be delivered using ground methods.By passing a customer’s postal and country codes as well as your desired delivery date to Shipium’s Shipment Timing API, you’ll receive recommendations on when an order should be dropped to a facility and the date it should be shipped by.Wrapping up\\nWhen considering how to reduce shipping costs, many enterprise shippers are missing opportunities to do so early in the process.Much of what you’re doing later in the process — for example, rate shopping across multiple carriers — can be brought upstream to ensure that every aspect of your workflow is as cost-efficient as possible.Shipium can help to further optimize the process by either enabling or simplifying these cost saving measures through our flexible and highly responsive APIs.If you’re looking for a solution that can fit into existing processes to find additional optimizations and maximize the value of your existing technology investments, reach out to our

reality.When you switch to Shipium, you will be surprised to realize what shipping tech in the modern age can do.Own Your Technology\\nTake back control of your operations through a centralized console for all your outbound shipping.Shipium has over 100 features available for self-service, and customers are shocked how easy it is.What used to be expensive and long projects for the most trivial of things, like updating carrier capacity, is a task completed in seconds and immediately propagated across your fulfillment network.More on how we give you control\\nSelf-service UIs giving you full control\\nNo external tech support or scripting required\\nUpdates immediate propagate across your full network\\nJust one of hundreds of features available in Shipium's modern console\\nEnhance Your Existing Systems\\nGartner's 2024 Report on Multi-Carrier Parcel Management Solutions noted this powerful point:\\nMost providers of ERP, transportation management systems (TMS), order management systems (OMS) and warehouse management systems (WMS) do not specialize in parcel capability.Rather, they partner with a noncompeting multicarrier parcel management solution (MCPMS) to support their customers.This leaves users with a gap in capability and need for a stand-alone solution.More on the Gartner report\\n\\\"Optimize and consolidate parcel shipments by using an MCPMS as a complementary solution to the TMS and/or WMS, ERP or OMS, or as a transportation solution for shippers that primarily use parcel as their mode of transportation.\\\"Dramatic Cost

practices for optimizing parcel delivery\\nSimplify and refine your parcel strategy with Shipium\\nFor high-volume businesses, moving products from warehouse to customer represents one of their most significant operational expenses.To take control and manage costs, you need to implement a robust parcel strategy designed to streamline your processes.This guide explores the importance of parcel shipping optimization and presents practical strategies to help improve your current approach.What is parcel delivery optimization?Parcel delivery optimization is a method of improving the efficiency and — more importantly — the reliability of your overall shipping process, from initial carrier selection to final delivery.Combining strategic planning with the right technology can enhance your fulfillment performance and save money.Key business outcomes of optimized shipping\\nBy working toward an optimized shipping process, you can: \\nReduce operational costs through better routing, lower fuel consumption, and better resource utilization\\nIncrease profitability with improved spending control across shipping operations\\nBoost customer satisfaction through faster shipping, better tracking, and proactive issue resolution\\nStrengthen ecommerce supply chain performance with lower inventory levels and shorter cash cycles\\nGain competitive advantage through superior service levels and scalable operations\\nKey components of streamlined parcel shipment \\nBefore exploring strategies for parcel shipping optimization, let’s take a closer look at the common elements found in mature fulfillment processes:\\nRobust carrier management\\nYour network is only as efficient as the providers within it.One of the most important steps toward delivery efficiency is implementing a multi-carrier solution designed to handle contract management, reduce manual decision-making, and improve fulfillment.Successful carrier management requires:\\nEnhanced selection efficiency: Evaluate shipping providers based on cost, reliability, and service coverage to build an optimal mix for your delivery network.Favorable pricing: Apply volume data and performance metrics to negotiate contracts that align with your shipping patterns.Strategic relationships: Maintain open communication channels with carriers and review performance tracking to ensure reliable capacity and performance standards.A solution like Shipium can manage your shipping network and improve per-package carrier selection, helping speed up operations and increase profits.For example, when Saks expanded beyond a single provider to a diverse carrier network that included regional last-mile services using our platform, three-day deliveries became more cost-effective than slower shipping options.Intelligent packaging optimization\\nWhether your boxes have excess space or poorly packed shipments result in damaged products, not having well-defined cartonization strategies impacts your bottom line and enhances customer satisfaction.A strong strategy should prioritize:\\nReducing dimensional weight charges: Design packaging strategies that minimize wasted space while maintaining product protection during transit.Streamlining order grouping: Analyze order patterns to combine or split shipments based on cost efficiency and delivery speed requirements.Leading WMS platforms like Manhattan and Blue Yonder include built-in cartonization modules to optimize package sizing at the warehouse level.However, adopting an advanced platform like Shipium enhances the functionality of your systems.With the Packaging Planner API, for instance, you can extend your package planning capabilities upstream, enabling better decision-making before routing orders.Efficient shipment routing\\nYour parcel shipment operations can become more productive if your systems intelligently route your orders to ensure products are sent to customers from the closest locations, significantly reducing transit times and increasing profit margins.A comprehensive routing process should:\\nDesign optimal delivery paths: Create routes based on destination zones, service levels, and carrier capabilities to minimize transit time and costs.Leverage routing tools: Apply advanced algorithms and real-time data to select the best shipping lanes for each order.Adapt to changing conditions: Monitor and adjust routing decisions based on weather, capacity constraints, and other macro-environmental factors affecting delivery.It's important to bridge your existing systems to ensure you make the best decisions when managing your orders.A software solution like Shipium's Fulfillment Engine, for example, uses advanced machine learning to manage and direct orders appropriately, minimizing shipping expenses while maximizing delivery speed and accuracy.Strategic shipping technology integration\\nModernizing your current shipping process requires the right technology stack.This stack should promote automation whenever possible and use cloud-based infrastructure to reduce development lead time and budget.Essential technology components include:\\nDeploying comprehensive shipping software: Adopt platforms that centralize carrier management, eliminate routine manual activities, and provide real-time visibility across operations.Applying predictive analytics: Use historical shipping data and market trends to forecast demand, fine-tune inventory levels, and plan carrier capacity needs.Automating fulfillment choices: Apply rules-based logic and machine learning to make instant routing choices based on service levels and cost parameters.Explore how predictive analytics can improve your ability to make strategic supply chain decisions.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ZVzTZ/9ZOrNapAalHv4g6eGrlh0TccRsv1U38tgfwOA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b7316e58-fea2-42e0-bf4d-40f3aac53c60":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b7316e58-fea2-42e0-bf4d-40f3aac53c60\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipium.com/blog/parcel-shipping-optimization-a-guide\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"fce47719-6755-45ec-8637-9e8ec791fd69\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipium.com/blog/parcel-shipping-optimization-a-guide\"},\"hash\":\"n2SioBkXqG79K1WMQLIp/9xDZ2Igb7pEnO2Z7cyCCPE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d9a3969b-2dfe-4c14-b0d0-14d8822b23b1\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipium.com/blog/parcel-shipping-optimization-a-guide\"},\"hash\":\"ZVzTZ/9ZOrNapAalHv4g6eGrlh0TccRsv1U38tgfwOA=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"213d2f4c-7acf-4c72-9d24-ac8012e3ba9c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"BY8HTJk056Stc4cyY2E6BpP1YrZTeNZBUKUP/XD12CI=\"}},\"text\":\"It's

strategic supply chain decisions.How to optimize your parcel shipping strategies for cost and efficiency\\nHere are five tactical and strategic improvements that you can implement to help enhance your current parcel shipping strategy: \\nEnhance your rate shopping \\n\\nEffective, automated rate shopping ensures that your business consistently selects the most economical delivery options.To improve your current process, consider:\\nUsing real-time comparison tools: Access instant multi-carrier quotes to make quick, informed decisions on parcel shipments based on current prices.Conducting accurate cost analysis: Gather complete costs — including surcharges and accessorials — to better understand and compare carrier charges.Improving service level selection: Balance shipping costs against delivery requirements to meet both budget constraints and customer expectations.Discover how fully loaded rate shopping maximizes your cost savings.Consolidate your shipments \\n\\nStrategic consolidation can transform shipping efficiency.Properly combining shipments increases delivery density while reducing handling points and product damage.Here's how to approach it:\\nBuild order groups: Combine multiple orders by destination to reduce per-package costs while maintaining delivery speed requirements.Leverage zone skipping methods: Use regional carriers and strategic routing to bypass shipping zones and reduce long-distance transportation costs.Distribute your inventory: Place your stock across your warehouses strategically to minimize shipping zones and improve delivery times across your network.See how last-mile delivery can impact your bottom-line shipping expenses.Automate your fulfillment processes \\n\\nManual tasks create bottlenecks and increase error rates in shipping operations.A well-designed strategy connects systems and streamlines workflows to:\\nSimplify order workflows: Automate routine fulfillment activities from order receipt to delivery to reduce manual intervention and processing time.Integrate warehouse systems: Connect your Order Management System (OMS) and Warehouse Management System platforms to ensure seamless data flow and eliminate information silos.Enhance operational efficiency: Implement intelligent sorting and packaging systems to increase accuracy and throughput in your operations.Increase your delivery options and flexibility\\n\\nToday's customers expect shipping choices that match their specific needs — and not meeting those expectations can lead to negative reviews and lost sales.Consider applying the following improvements to your parcel strategy:\\nExpand delivery options: Offer multiple shipping speeds from same-day to standard delivery to match varying customer needs and budgets.Generate accurate estimates: Create precise timelines using actual time carrier data and historical performance metrics.Offer flexible pickup: Provide customers with convenient alternatives like secure lockers and delivery to retail locations to improve satisfaction.Shippers often avoid economy services for time-sensitive deliveries without reliable insights, defaulting to more expensive options.Software that properly reviews performance data can power more informed shipping method selection.For example, our dynamic Time-in-Transit Model analyzes historical performance to identify when economy services can reliably keep delivery promises, helping you reduce shipping costs.Improve your order tracking and communication\\n\\nTransparent status notifications create confident customers and reduce support queries.End-to-end visibility transforms the post-purchase experience by:\\nBoosting tracking visibility: Provide real-time parcel shipment location and updates as orders move through your supply chain.Sending proactive alerts: Notify customers about shipping milestones and potential delays to manage delivery expectations.Easing returns management: Simplify the returns process with easy label generation and convenient dropoff options to improve the customer experience.Many businesses struggle with communication due to gaps between operational systems and customer-facing

this article\\nWhy Use Economy Shipping Methods?Enter Shipium’s Dynamic TNT Model\\nWrapping up\\nEfficient and cost-effective shipping methods like UPS Mail Innovations, FedEx SmartPost / Ground Economy, and DHL Ecommerce enable you to diversify shipping options for customers, increase margins or pass savings on to customers, improve the sustainability of shipping operations, and more.Here’s the problem: because of the absence of SLAs and general performance unpredictability, shippers don’t leverage these options as often as they could (or should).Shipments that have a date constraint (“delivery by Thursday”, “deliver in 3-5 business days”) typically won’t flow to these cost-effective carrier services because shippers can’t know for certain when a shipment will be delivered.Legacy tech and DIY internal efforts simply don’t have the capabilities to send more volume to these services as a result.The good news?One of the primary use cases for Shipium’s Dynamic Time-in-Transit Model is to create accurate EDDs for economy shipping methods, effectively enabling you to establish a dynamic SLA that’s backed by our machine learning models.In this article, we’ll explain how you can leverage the insights provided by the Time-in-Transit Model to reduce costs through intelligent downgrades to economy shipping methods, unlock value with regional carriers, and more.Why Use Economy Shipping Methods?Before diving into the details of how Shipium can help you take greater advantage of economy shipping options, let’s review the reasons why you’d want to do so in the first place.While specific benefits can vary by use case, here are the general advantages of economy shipping.It’s a lower-cost option\\nThe most obvious reason to use economy service methods is that they’re cheaper on a per-unit basis — creating higher margins, or savings that you can pass on to customers or invest in other areas of the business.Beyond the direct reduction in shipping costs, it’s also worth mentioning that using economy shipping can improve your negotiating leverage for premium service options — more on this shortly.Scalable and sustainable market expansion\\nWhile there’s always a degree of investment when expanding to new geographies, economy shipping makes it possible to do so without significantly increasing costs.This helps to de-risk expansion efforts by limiting financial downside if the new market doesn’t pan out (ex.due to lack of demand).Limiting fulfillment costs while expanding to new markets can also enable you to offer more competitive pricing and attract price-sensitive customers — many of whom will become repeat shoppers.Greater negotiating leverage\\nIn many situations (for example, being single-threaded with a carrier), you may not have the leverage to negotiate more favorable rates.Instead, to keep the delivery promise you’ve made to your customers, you often need to pay for premium shipping options that can guarantee delivery by a certain date.When it comes to negotiating discounts with a single carrier, being able to scalably leverage economy shipping can help to shift that paradigm.For example — if you can send more volume to UPS MI without impacting the customer experience, you may be able to leverage that to negotiate stronger volume discounts for UPS 5-Day Ground.However, as we mentioned earlier, economy shipping methods aren’t nearly as widely-used as they could be, despite these benefits.The reason is simple — on a risk-adjusted basis, it’s a smarter move to pay a premium for the sure thing than risk breaking your delivery promise to a customer.But what if you didn’t have to choose between breaking your promise and breaking the bank?Enter Shipium’s Dynamic TNT Model\\nShipium’s Dynamic Time-in-Transit Model creates value throughout the supply chain, and is used for everything from providing accurate EDDs to building supply chain resilience.Our large pool of shipment data is analyzed by proprietary machine learning models to provide accurate and actionable insights related to your shipping strategy — in this case, specific to carrier performance.The Time-in-Transit model can analyze the performance of different carriers’ economy shipping methods, account for unique business rules (such as the required delivery date for an item), and help you uncover new opportunities to use economy shipping while delivering on customers’ expectations.Use Cases\\nWhile there are many use cases and benefits associated with Shipium’s Dynamic Time-in-Transit Model, here are some that specifically relate to use of economy shipping methods:\\nIntelligent downgrades: If you haven’t negotiated favorable rates for premium service methods, you can use Dynamic TNT to establish SLAs for Economy Shipping methods and strategically downgrade where it’s appropriate.This also gives you more leverage when negotiating premium options, as carriers will know that you have a scalable, high-margin solution in place.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"E6ESRXrgfqmHMGEDc0TaA2UTF9wktulrwscEcjBJXvA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"cf15d18b-a533-4d63-a617-4aed6a7cba68":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"cf15d18b-a533-4d63-a617-4aed6a7cba68\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipium.com/blog/leverage-economy-shipping-methods\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"474cbf48-6156-4bac-b085-2c9ba4abbd3c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipium.com/blog/leverage-economy-shipping-methods\"},\"hash\":\"B0pUTZdVlDMVXz+K4zvYc4MV+kH4CZpws2vCv65/8e0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a359dee7-5e8f-4f28-bd1d-57bc3c90a1e5\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.shipium.com/blog/leverage-economy-shipping-methods\"},\"hash\":\"E6ESRXrgfqmHMGEDc0TaA2UTF9wktulrwscEcjBJXvA=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"78f24c7b-76ad-4632-8914-f267a82ebb05\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"fTnnUAjGXSxrFYfynSHt0MeAelyMW7MFDCKHnz6R/xA=\"}},\"text\":\"Our

regions typically means they can offer more competitive rates and delivery estimates — Shipium can surface these carriers for you.Efficient inventory management: Determine the most efficient place to store inventory, not based on just warehouse location but also historical carrier efficiency and performance.Run a smoother, more predictable inventory management operation.Enhanced shopping experience: By leveraging Shipium’s Dynamic TNT, you can offer dynamic pricing (ex.offering free shipping for products with lower predicted TNT), provide accurate EDDs even for cheaper shipping options, and generally offer more options that appeal to price-sensitive and eager shoppers alike.You can also leverage this technology to quickly pivot shipments to new carriers when faced with disruptions, build reports on overall carrier performance, and offer “greener” shipping options, depending on your organization’s priorities.In any case, you can use Shipium to quickly find savings and improve the efficiency of your operations.How it works\\nShipium’s Time-in-Transit predictions are calculated by our powerful, proprietary machine learning models, which analyze a wide range of data gathered on transit, topology, and macro-conditions impacting shipping.The platform will also factor in any known carrier promotions or changes to default rates that could help to further lower costs.It’s important to note that recommended carriers and service options aren’t “one-size-fits-all” — you can input customer overrides to give our platform context unique to your business, such as discounts you’ve negotiated for specific shipping lanes or EDDs you’ve provided to your customers.Once you’ve provided the necessary inputs, Shipium will surface the most efficient shipping lanes, carriers, and service methods for you to choose from.Your recommendations will follow a hierarchy based on the inputs you’ve provided, ordered by:\\nKnown customer overrides and unique business rules\\nShipium’s recommended options based on cost-effectiveness and predicted TNT\\nAny relevant carrier defaults or promotions that are cost-competitive\\nContinuous monitoring of supply chain performance enables you to analyze different TNT configurations so you can continue to make impactful improvements over time.For more details, see our full documentation.Real customer results\\nBy applying Shipium’s Dynamic TNT to search for feasible economy shipping methods, an enterprise clothing retailer determined that they could move $30M out of $180M in total shipments to economy shipping method based on the differences between Shipium’s predicted Time-in-Transit vs. carrier defaults — enabling them to intelligently downgrade.Their CPP was reduced by $0.36, resulting in $29.6 million in savings.Wrapping up\\nShipium’s Dynamic Time-in-Transit Model can help you to scalably leverage economy shipping methods, downgrade from premium methods as appropriate, better leverage regional carriers with more competitive rates, and uncover new layers of savings within your shipping operations.If you’re looking for ways to strategically reduce shipping costs while continuing to honor your
