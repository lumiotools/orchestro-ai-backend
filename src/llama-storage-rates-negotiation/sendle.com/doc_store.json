Based on customer feedback, Extensiv has added Sendle’s expansive network of affordable, national package delivery services to its Small Parcel Suite, just in time for peak season 2023. This integration enables more small online retailers to take advantage of Sendle’s affordable door-to-door package delivery service that is not only built for small business, but is also 100% carbon-neutral.  \\n“Small parcel shipping can be very challenging for 3PLs and we are always looking for additional services that help them provide outstanding customer service and reduce shipping costs,” says Richard Kang, VP of partnerships at Extensiv. “We recently surveyed our 3PL warehouse management customers and they expressed significant interest in Sendle. Based on this customer demand, we are pleased to now offer support for Sendle within our integrated solution. It’s a valuable shipping option for 3PLs and their e-commerce customers – especially as peak season 2023 quickly approaches.” \\nExtensiv’s Small Parcel Suite provides everything 3PLs need to automate the fulfillment process, from packing and shipping to the cost-efficient selection of carriers. This integration with Sendle, helps to level the playing field for 3PLs and their smaller e-commerce customers by giving them easy access to reliable, national shipping with low shipping rates that are up to 83% cheaper with no hidden fees or subscriptions required.  \\n“3PLs play an essential part of the small business e-commerce ecosystem. As we head into the busy holiday season, it is important for 3PLs to find cost efficiencies in shipping and diversify carriers to get the best rates and ensure their customers’ small packages are delivered on time,” says James Chin Moody, CEO and co-founder of Sendle. “3PLs don’t need more complexity when it comes to small package shipping; they need better rates and services that meet their smaller e-commerce customers’ shipping needs, and our partnership with Extensiv makes it easier for 3PLs to deliver on both fronts.” \\nHelping 3PLs save time, increase net revenue \\nTogether, Extensiv and Sendle will work to provide 3PLs and their customers with the support they need to save on small parcel shipping. In addition to enabling 3PLs to diversify their shipping partners and cut rates, the Extensiv and Sendle partnership offers savings as well as prioritized support for 3PLs and their customers. 3PLs can also take advantage of simple set up through Extensiv’s Small Parcel Suite helping them to save time and increase net revenue with the Sendle integration. \\nMore information about the Extensiv and Sendle integration can be found at: https://try.sendle.com/en-us/partners/extensiv \\nAbout Sendle \\nSendle is the first delivery network in North America specifically designed to serve the needs of small ecommerce businesses.

Ever since I started teaching business English I have worked on compiling topic-based word lists, explanations and examples that would help me better understand the conceptual jargon of various domains of English for business and how different terminology applies to them. All those interested in developing their abilities to speak, read and write English for business purposes will find this dictionary as an extremely useful tool, which can enhance their professional communication competence and genre-specific appropriacy. The dictionary comprises thirteen business-related topic-based units that are most relevant to students of economics, learners and teachers of English, as well as to business professionals. Based on experience and research in the field, I decided to cover the following areas: accounting, banking and finance, business administration, business communication, economics, employment, environment protection, information technology, insurance, international trade, management, marketing and advertising, tourism and business travel. It consists of approximately 5,500 dictionary entries and 2,500 contexts of use for single words and typical collocations. Overlappings were avoided, except in cases when the words or collocations are used differently according to the area of interest (e.g. marketing vs accounting). The present edition does not include contexts for all the dictionary entries, but subsequent ones will concentrate on a wider coverage. I have included the bibliographical list of resources that I used in compiling this work, both print and online resources, glossaries, dictionaries, specialist business sites, specialist journals as well as other materials. There is at the end of the dictionary an alphabetical word index compiled based on the frequency principle, listing the first 160 most widely used single words (in English). The dictionary has also a digital version, which was created within the CNCS – UEFISCDI project: Universals and Variants of English and Romanian Business Metaphors. A Corpus-Based Conceptual Mapping of Contemporary Journalese (carried out during 2015-2017), available at: http://businessmetaphors.ro/, under the left-hand submenu English-Romanian Dictionary of Business Terminology. Each dictionary entry consists of a headword in English, translation into Romanian (several meanings of the word may be included), and in most 7\\n\\ncases, examples of contextual use. Examples may be phrases or full sentences, and when rendered from other sources, the website is indicated in parantheses. E.g.: headword\\n\\nmorphological category\\n\\ntranslation\\n\\nexample phrase (meaning 1 meaning 2\\n\\netc.)\\n\\naccount n. 1. evidenţa tranzacţiilor între parteneri, înregistrate ca debit şi credit; itemised account 2. articol din registrul contabil; to keep a record of accounts 3. cont bancar; open a bank account 4. factură, notă de plată; to square the account 5. relatare, descriere, explicaţie, raport, referat; to corroborate a report abatement n. reducere, degrevare; Taxpayers use Form 843 to claim a refund (or abatement) of certain overpaid (or over-assessed) taxes, interest, penalties, and additions to tax.

Încă de la începutul carierei mele didactice, am realizat diverse glosare terminologice, cu explicații, traduceri și exemple de folosire a cuvintelor sau frazelor în context reale, în încercarea de a înțelege mai bine domeniul complex al comunicării scrise și orale în afaceri. Înțelegerea terminologiei specificie este o provocare atât pentru specialiștii din diverse ramuri economice, cât și pentru profesorul sau traducătorul de limba engleză. Așadar, pornind de la propriile mele experiențe și nevoi, am realizat acest dicționar și din dorința de a veni în sprijinul tuturor acelor care doresc să își dezvolte competențele de comunicare orală și în scris, traducătorilor, interpreților sau profesorilor de limba engleză de afaceri. Dicționarul este organizat în treisprezece unități tematice, pornind de la cele mai importante sub-domenii ale universului economic, prezente atât în programele școlare de la liceele economice și în planurile de învățământ ale facultăților de științe economice din România, cât și în literatura de specialitate sau în presa de profil. Gama este variată și cuprinde contabilitate, finanțe și bănci, administrarea afacerilor, comunicare în afaceri, micro- și macroeconomie, resurse umane, protecția mediului înconjurător, tehnologia informațiilor, asigurări, comerț international, management, marketing, turism. Sunt incluse aproximativ 5500 de cuvinte-titlu (sau expresii), precum și aproximativ 2500 de contexte pentru utilizarea acestora în situații reale de comunicare. Am evitat repetarea termenilor în diversele glosare, și am optat pentru aeastă strategie doar dacă am identificat sensuri diferite în funcție de subdomeniul de utilizare. Ediția curentă nu oferă exemple de utilizare în context pentru fiecare cuvânt sau expresie, acest lucru fiind intenționat pentru edițiile ulterioare. Am inclus lista bibliografică a tuturor resurselor utilizate, atât dicționare în format tipărit, cât și online, glosare de specialitate, site-uri Internet dedicate, reviste economice, precum și alte materiale din domeniu. La final există un index alfabetic, în limba engleză, care conține 160 cele mai utilizate cuvinte din cadrul dicționarului (realizat pe baza pricipiului frecvenței) Dicționarul este disponibil și intr-o versiune digitalizată (produs realizat în cadrul proiectului CNCS – UEFISCDI, intitulat Invariante universale și variante ale metaforei economice în limbile română și engleză.

and Sendle Expand Partnership to Make Low-Cost, Sustainable Shipping More Accessible for Small and Medium-sized Businesses Across the US and Canada\\nSendle’s parcel delivery network is now accessible to small businesses via Easyship’s free ecommerce shipping software\\nOctober 04, 2023 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time\\nNEW YORK & SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sendle and Easyship announced today that their partnership, which began in Australia, has been expanded to give small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the U.S.and Canada easy access to competitively-priced, sustainable parcel delivery.Effective immediately, Sendle’s portfolio of affordable, 100% carbon-neutral door-to-door delivery services are available as a shipping option for businesses in the U.S.and Canada that use Easyship’s free eCommerce shipping software.Easyship customers in the U.S.will save up to 83% using Sendle while Canadian customers will save up to 82% using Sendle.“Inflation is putting extraordinary pressure on smaller eCommerce businesses and the last thing they need right now are more costs”\\nPost this\\nResearch finds that while inflation has made online shoppers more price-sensitive, sustainable shipping is still a top priority for over 86% of them.The partnership between Easyship and Sendle brings together Sendle’s low shipping rates and reliable 100% carbon-neutral delivery networks across the U.S.and Canada with the power of Easyship’s all-in-one shipping management tool.The tool’s robust capabilities helps businesses better compete in today’s demanding eCommerce environment, with numerous automations and check-out features to boost conversions.“Inflation is putting extraordinary pressure on smaller eCommerce businesses and the last thing they need right now

sustainable shipping is not only good for the planet but it can also help to differentiate small and medium-sized businesses that are competing against the eCommerce giants.There couldn’t be a better time for us to expand our partnership with Easyship because smaller businesses, no matter where they are, need all the help they can get to win in today’s ultra-competitive online market.”100% Carbon-neutral shipping saves the planet and money\\nSendle’s delivery network uses existing shipping providers, filling their vehicles to ensure every route is as efficient and profitable as possible.In turn, savings are passed along to Sendle customers.To account for the remaining carbon emissions and address the impact of every Sendle parcel sent, Sendle purchases carbon offsets and

Parcel Suite \\nEL SEGUNDO, CA and SEATTLE, WA – Extensiv and Sendle have teamed up to lower the cost of small parcel shipping for third-party logistics providers (3PLs) serving the U.S.e-commerce market.Extensiv provides omnichannel software solutions for warehouse, inventory, and order management to 3PLs and leading brands.Based on customer feedback, Extensiv has added Sendle’s expansive network of affordable, national package delivery services to its Small Parcel Suite, just in time for peak season 2023.This integration enables more small online retailers to take advantage of Sendle’s affordable door-to-door package delivery service that is not only built for small business, but is also 100% carbon-neutral.“Small parcel shipping can be very challenging for 3PLs and we are always looking for additional services that help them provide outstanding customer service and reduce shipping costs,” says Richard Kang, VP of partnerships at Extensiv.“We recently surveyed our 3PL warehouse management customers and they expressed significant interest in Sendle.Based on this customer demand, we are pleased to now offer support for Sendle within our integrated solution.It’s a valuable shipping option for 3PLs and their e-commerce customers – especially as peak season 2023 quickly approaches.”Extensiv’s Small Parcel Suite provides everything 3PLs need to automate the fulfillment process, from packing and shipping to the cost-efficient selection of carriers.This integration with Sendle, helps to level the playing field for 3PLs and their smaller e-commerce customers by giving them easy access to reliable, national shipping with low shipping rates that are up to 83% cheaper with no hidden fees or subscriptions required.“3PLs play an essential part of the small business e-commerce ecosystem.As we head into the busy holiday season, it is important for 3PLs to find cost efficiencies in shipping and diversify carriers to get the best rates and ensure their customers’ small packages are delivered on time,” says James Chin Moody, CEO and co-founder of Sendle.“3PLs don’t need more complexity when it comes to small package shipping; they need better rates and services that meet their smaller e-commerce customers’ shipping needs, and our partnership with Extensiv makes it easier for 3PLs to deliver on both fronts.”Helping 3PLs save time, increase net revenue \\nTogether, Extensiv and Sendle will work to provide 3PLs and their customers with the support they need to save on small parcel shipping.In addition to enabling 3PLs to diversify their shipping partners and cut rates, the Extensiv and Sendle partnership offers savings as well as prioritized support for 3PLs and their customers.3PLs can also take advantage of simple set up through Extensiv’s Small Parcel Suite helping them to save time and increase net revenue with the Sendle integration.More information about the Extensiv and Sendle integration can be found at:

dictionary is the result of twenty years of teaching and researching English for Specific Purposes, translating and interpreting in the field of business, banking and finance.Ever since I started teaching business English I have worked on compiling topic-based word lists, explanations and examples that would help me better understand the conceptual jargon of various domains of English for business and how different terminology applies to them.All those interested in developing their abilities to speak, read and write English for business purposes will find this dictionary as an extremely useful tool, which can enhance their professional communication competence and genre-specific appropriacy.The dictionary comprises thirteen business-related topic-based units that are most relevant to students of economics, learners and teachers of English, as well as to business professionals.Based on experience and research in the field, I decided to cover the following areas: accounting, banking and finance, business administration, business communication, economics, employment, environment protection, information technology, insurance, international trade, management, marketing and advertising, tourism and business travel.It consists of approximately 5,500 dictionary entries and 2,500 contexts of use for single words and typical collocations.Overlappings were avoided, except in cases when the words or collocations are used differently according to the area of interest (e.g.marketing vs accounting).The present edition does not include contexts for all the dictionary entries, but subsequent ones will concentrate on a wider coverage.I have included the bibliographical list of resources that I used in compiling this work, both print and online resources, glossaries, dictionaries, specialist business sites, specialist journals as well as other materials.There is at the end of the dictionary an alphabetical word index compiled based on the frequency principle, listing the first 160 most widely used single words (in English).The dictionary has also a digital version, which was created within the CNCS – UEFISCDI project: Universals and Variants of English and Romanian Business Metaphors.A Corpus-Based Conceptual Mapping of Contemporary Journalese (carried out during 2015-2017), available at: http://businessmetaphors.ro/, under the left-hand submenu English-Romanian Dictionary of Business Terminology.Each dictionary entry consists of a headword in English, translation into Romanian (several meanings of the word may be included), and in most 7\\n\\ncases, examples of contextual use.Examples may be phrases or full sentences, and when rendered from other sources, the website is indicated in parantheses.E.g.: headword\\n\\nmorphological category\\n\\ntranslation\\n\\nexample phrase (meaning 1 meaning 2\\n\\netc.)\\n\\naccount n.1.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"E05zr83U3SxkCIQ8PsDIxiM7ofhqG4hFghiropHqsgw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2c1ce946-2a5d-4d8e-b459-0401cd5ca1ae":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2c1ce946-2a5d-4d8e-b459-0401cd5ca1ae\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://pdfcoffee.com/dictionar-de-terminologie-de-afaceri-pdf-free.html\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c8f79a63-0ac3-4e93-b91c-8d96d048dac9\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://pdfcoffee.com/dictionar-de-terminologie-de-afaceri-pdf-free.html\"},\"hash\":\"ndmej/IEj/Fm/mebrl4Li7iTUn6TPRTLsIS6Fxg+Rvs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d7277326-96bc-496f-9af4-1034eb3cf27e\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://pdfcoffee.com/dictionar-de-terminologie-de-afaceri-pdf-free.html\"},\"hash\":\"7qQb+FB346JV61dkbd7afsbXsRUmG/SBxP4pYoAQuJI=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"4d22a888-506f-4dc1-a73c-1a256bed6f99\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"AU8PBOXirevmrR0MDwYhDhNSk5Jm4m7bGKQoU3S6rAM=\"}},\"text\":\"The

cercetarea limbajului de afaceri în limbile engleză și română, precum și al activității de traducere și interpretariat din domeniul economic, finanțelor sau contabilității.Încă de la începutul carierei mele didactice, am realizat diverse glosare terminologice, cu explicații, traduceri și exemple de folosire a cuvintelor sau frazelor în context reale, în încercarea de a înțelege mai bine domeniul complex al comunicării scrise și orale în afaceri.Înțelegerea terminologiei specificie este o provocare atât pentru specialiștii din diverse ramuri economice, cât și pentru profesorul sau traducătorul de limba engleză.Așadar, pornind de la propriile mele experiențe și nevoi, am realizat acest dicționar și din dorința de a veni în sprijinul tuturor acelor care doresc să își dezvolte competențele de comunicare orală și în scris, traducătorilor, interpreților sau profesorilor de limba engleză de afaceri.Dicționarul este organizat în treisprezece unități tematice, pornind de la cele mai importante sub-domenii ale universului economic, prezente atât în programele școlare de la liceele economice și în planurile de învățământ ale facultăților de științe economice din România, cât și în literatura de specialitate sau în presa de profil.Gama este variată și cuprinde contabilitate, finanțe și bănci, administrarea afacerilor, comunicare în afaceri, micro- și macroeconomie, resurse umane, protecția mediului înconjurător, tehnologia informațiilor, asigurări, comerț international, management, marketing, turism.Sunt incluse aproximativ 5500 de cuvinte-titlu (sau expresii), precum și aproximativ 2500 de contexte pentru utilizarea acestora în situații reale de comunicare.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"bmrEbSbvluh3NAK5EW18kIrNlo7ahXTjDs0SfjYr8CY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4d22a888-506f-4dc1-a73c-1a256bed6f99":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4d22a888-506f-4dc1-a73c-1a256bed6f99\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://pdfcoffee.com/dictionar-de-terminologie-de-afaceri-pdf-free.html\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c8f79a63-0ac3-4e93-b91c-8d96d048dac9\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://pdfcoffee.com/dictionar-de-terminologie-de-afaceri-pdf-free.html\"},\"hash\":\"ndmej/IEj/Fm/mebrl4Li7iTUn6TPRTLsIS6Fxg+Rvs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2c1ce946-2a5d-4d8e-b459-0401cd5ca1ae\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://pdfcoffee.com/dictionar-de-terminologie-de-afaceri-pdf-free.html\"},\"hash\":\"yn3F6QRzGYcPuCutetmSqgIhRJYaSOXzwW7hRtV5bcw=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ae7c9da0-2c1b-40d4-87c1-c6ca1c47d626\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"bb5tW2MqSd/gfdxJWCNZpw5dIuDiM8M/v21fCvgtE1Q=\"}},\"text\":\"Gama
