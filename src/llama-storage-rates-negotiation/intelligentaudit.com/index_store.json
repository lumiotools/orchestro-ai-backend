shipping technology has readily emerged alongside it.Many businesses have integrated these impactful tools to meet the demand for change in the transportation market.And since transportation costs continue to rise, 11.4% in 2019 and an unreported amount in 2020, says FleetOwner, the need to control logistics spend has never been higher.The benefits of reducing costs and saving time are always a plus, but the ability to automate and streamline specific processes has changed the entire game.This modern technology also promotes solid data-driven choices, allowing for more efficiency in creating and implementing shipping strategies.And shippers need to know the top four ways to reduce costs and exponentially save time by utilizing this powerful technology.It Reduces Time Wasted in Auditing Invoices\nDigging through filing cabinets, sifting through mountains of paperwork, and manually locating errors within shipping bills or invoices when auditing consumes large amounts of time and effort.Team members find this very tedious and exhausting.The solution is to have all documents digitized and in a central data location where a thorough search is just a click away.Shipping technology grants this ease of access which ultimately reduces the time commitment required in finding mistakes and reduces human errors.Without a doubt, this saves a ton of time and certainly presents more opportunities for team members to work on practical tasks that directly increase revenue.Technology and Automation Streamline Back-Office Management\nMany back-office processes consume unnecessary amounts of time.That much is simple, and most businesses have now turned to automation tools for monotonous and repetitive tasks to save time and essentially money.Automating tasks like record keeping, data entry, and payroll saves valuable hours that can instead be spent on front-end priorities.Shipping technology promotes a solid digital streamlined approach.This essentially allows employees to accomplish more in less time.No longer do team members have to worry about lost papers and making avoidable mistakes.This whole process will focus and energy back on the predominant tasks earning organizations more time and reducing costs.Download the White Paper\nShipping Technology Enables Data-Driven Decision Making\nThe manual process of carrier selection involves many complexities.For instance, determining the optimal combination of rates and lanes for a specific shipment requires accurate calculations.The guesswork gets eliminated in this grueling task, thanks to technology like a transportation management system (TMS).In real-time, this serviceable technology enables businesses to choose the best carrier for each shipment based upon service level and cost.Shipping technology offers solutions that help logistic and parcel decision-makers arrive at the best possible data-driven conclusions.Integration Keeps Collaboration and Workflows Moving\nFor day-to-day operations, integrating popular cloud-based tools allows for the communication pipeline to flow much more straightforward.Instead of sending files back and forth via email or making lengthy phone calls, team members can fluidly share documents and update one another in real-time.Shipping technology encourages collaborative exchange, and things like the cloud effectively bridge tasks that require cross-department involvement.This significantly saves time, reduces costs, and makes communication simple.Reap the Rewards of Shipping Technology to Reduce Shipping Costs Today\nCompanies have increasingly embraced these essential time-saving and cost reduction solutions.And the demand for more supply chain KPIs is promoting a more data-driven and collaborative approach to performance improvement.Streamlining and automating time-consuming tasks has pathed the way for transportation modernity in today's supply chain.This new technological standard enables data-driven decision-making, enhancing shipping strategies, and improving overall outcomes, which brings lasting cost-reducing benefits to shipping businesses worldwide.The integration of shipping technology promotes a seamless collaboration across the board with ease and simplification, making employees more productive, less stressed, and above all, efficient.Connect with Intelligent Audit to get

chance to flawlessly steer your business through the storms of transportation costs, regardless of circumstances beyond your control.You’d jump at the chance, wouldn't you?While no perfect solution exists, technology is increasingly important in shaping a robust, future-proof financial strategy to accomplish these goals- from analytics to automation.This article will further detail how.As the Transportation Market Evolves, so do Financial Strategies\nIn a global, interconnected economy, managing transportation costs presents a complex puzzle for shippers.Developing a durable financial strategy is akin to a game of whack-a-mole with the market constantly in flux, fuel prices unstable, and continuous regulatory shifts.Let’s explore this further.CONFRONTING MARKET VOLATILITY\nMarket volatility, driven by myriad economic and geopolitical factors, is a constant variable in the transportation sector.We’ve seen it first hand recently with the effects of inflation, for instance.However, market volatility and instability influence more than costs and rates; it also significantly impacts resilience, necessitating a robust, proactive strategy.NAVIGATING FUEL PRICE FLUCTUATIONS\nThe volatility of fuel prices profoundly impacts transportation costs.However, through advanced technology, shippers can keep their heads above water and maneuver through them.Tools like data analytics and forecasting can help predict these shifts.At the same time, logistics network optimization can help devise optimal routes to minimize fuel consumption.With tech like this on your side to proactively prepare for the impact of sudden gas price surges, it’s possible to turn potential surprises into calculated variables.ADAPTING TO REGULATORY CHANGES\nRegulatory changes present a third challenge, further complicating the scenario.Changes in trade agreements, emission standards, and labor laws are just a few ways regulations can impact transportation costs.However, embracing technology to help foster an adaptable, fluid financial strategy can help convert these regulatory hurdles into manageable tasks with timely adaptation.Shippers Turn to Technology for Financial Optimization\nAs shippers face inconsistent market dynamics, technology has become an indispensable tool for financial optimization.Consider how the powerful trio of data-driven decision-making, actionable analytics, and integrated automation can help.DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING\nData is the foundation of informed decision-making.When shippers possess real-time, precise information, they gain the capability to foresee market changes and respond strategically.Moreover, through tools like business intelligence and analytics, the painstaking task of collecting, analyzing, and understanding comprehensive transportation data becomes simplified and streamlined.The fact that it also significantly enhances customer service is the cherry on top.ACTIONABLE ANALYTICS AND FORECASTING\nShaping the future through the lens of the past is no longer a wishful thought.Predictive analytics uses historical data to both anticipate and navigate future cost fluctuations.By fostering an environment of preparedness, this tool enables shippers to tactically plan, minimize risks, and finesse their financial strategies.Automated processes further enhance this advantage, minimizing human error while bolstering productivity.INTEGRATED AUTOMATION\nPicture this: automated invoice processing and auditing tasks, your team refocused on strategic decisions, and error rates plummeting.That's the power of integrated automation in action.With technology at the helm, these laborious tasks become streamlined, carving out a path for cost reduction and increased efficiency.It's more than just simplification—it's about taking the guesswork out of transportation costs and reinventing the wheel of financial processes in shipping.In a Challenging Freight Market, Nobody Can Do it Alone\nWithin the turbulent freight market, fostering collaboration is vital.By partnering with the right ally and utilizing cutting-edge technology, it's possible to optimize financial strategies and pave the way for long-term success and resilience.THE POWER OF A PARTNERSHIP WITH INTELLIGENT AUDIT\nEstablishing partnerships with technology providers underscores the potency of collaborative wisdom in navigating financial complexities.A partnership with Intelligent Audit unlocks access to advanced solutions, offering valuable tools for predictive analytics, data-driven decision-making, and integrated automation.The real treasure lies in the convergence of these resources, shaping robust financial strategies for shippers and leading to significant cost optimization in the long run.A

we see a horizon brimming with transformative trends and technological advancements.EMERGING TRENDS AND TECHNOLOGIES\nThe coming years promise a myriad of game-changing developments.Technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence stand poised to revolutionize decision-making processes, making them more precise and
