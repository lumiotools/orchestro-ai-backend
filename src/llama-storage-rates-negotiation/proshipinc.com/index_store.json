Experts\nNovember 20, 2024 8 min read\nDiscover how retailers can gain a competitive edge with the proper customer experience tactics, fulfillment strategies and shipping software\nThe holiday season is a whirlwind for retailers.As online shopping continues to grow, so does the pressure to deliver orders promptly and efficiently.To navigate this peak period and the upcoming year successfully, retailers must prioritize customer experience (CX), optimize fulfillment strategies, and harness the power of advanced shipping technology.From the moment a customer places an order to the moment they receive their package, every touchpoint matters.By understanding the challenges and opportunities that could come up, retailers can position themselves for success.Keep reading as we explore the key strategies that can help you navigate the year ahead:\nPrioritizing the Customer Experience: Learn how to exceed customer expectations through efficient returns and timely deliveries.Optimizing Fulfillment Strategies: Discover how to leverage omnichannel fulfillment to meet the diverse needs of your customers.Leveraging Shipping Software: Explore the benefits of advanced shipping technology in streamlining operations and reducing costs.Let’s dive in and ensure your retail business is well-prepared.Prioritizing the Customer Experience\nThe bar has been raised – peak season and the year ahead is a time of heightened expectations for customers.To stand out from the competition and ensure a positive shopping experience, retailers must prioritize efficient order fulfillment and seamless returns processing.Customer Choice and Transparency\nBefore diving into the post-purchase experience, it’s crucial to set the stage for a positive customer journey from the very beginning.One key aspect is offering customers a variety of shipping options to suit their needs.By providing clear and concise shipping information at the point of purchase AKA within the shopping cart, retailers can empower customers to make informed decisions.This includes:\nTransparent Shipping Options: Offer a range of shipping speeds and costs, clearly outlined at checkout.Accurate Delivery Estimates: Provide realistic delivery date estimates based on real-time carrier data and inventory availability.Flexible Shipping Preferences: Allow customers to choose their preferred delivery method, such as standard shipping, expedited shipping, or in-store pickup.By giving customers control over the shipping process, retailers can enhance satisfaction and foster loyalty.To ensure accurate shipping costs and delivery estimates, it’s crucial to leverage shipping software that offers real-time rate shopping capabilities.By providing customers with accurate shipping costs and delivery estimates at checkout, you can avoid surprises and increase customer satisfaction.Multi-carrier shipping solutions with traditional routing guides, which rely on pre-determined rates and carrier contracts, may not always provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.Real-time rate shopping, on the other hand, allows you to access the most current carrier rates based on package dimensions, weight, and destination.This ensures that customers are presented with accurate shipping costs and delivery times, leading to a more transparent and positive shopping experience [Read on: Unlock Maximum Shipping Cost Savings: Real-Time Rate Shopping at the Packing Station].A 360-Degree View of CX\nFor many retailers, the customer journey doesn’t end with the delivery of a package.In fact, the post-purchase experience, including returns and exchanges, can significantly impact customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.According to our recent survey (The ProShip Report 2024), 35% of retailers identified customer satisfaction as their top concern when it comes to returns.This highlights the importance of a seamless return process, from easy initiation to timely refunds.By focusing on the entire customer journey, retailers can create a seamless and positive shopping experience that drives repeat business.Real-Time Visibility for Informed Customers\nProviding customers with real-time visibility into the status of their orders is crucial for building trust and loyalty.By implementing advanced tracking systems, especially ones that communicate seamlessly with shipping software, retailers can keep customers informed and alleviate concerns about delayed shipments.[Learn more about finding success with actionable shipping data]\nStreamlining Returns for Customer Satisfaction\nReturns are an inevitable part of the retail business, especially during the post-holiday season.By streamlining the returns process, retailers can improve customer satisfaction and minimize operational costs.Self-Service Returns: Empower customers to initiate returns online or through mobile devices, reducing the need for phone calls and in-store visits.Flexible Return Policies: Offer generous return windows and flexible return options, such as in-store credit or exchanges.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"c+70+8jVT67YFoU61Q0ARlJsOeVuoHxFhT6qguxtzDI="},"15c6ce6b-6a84-49cc-8315-469e25ebc44d":{"id_":"15c6ce6b-6a84-49cc-8315-469e25ebc44d","metadata":{"url":"https://proshipinc.com/blog/optimizing-your-shipping-strategy-a-peak-season-how-to-guide-for-retailers/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6dc5f61e-9439-4e3b-9fef-d085aefa3bc5","metadata":{"url":"https://proshipinc.com/blog/optimizing-your-shipping-strategy-a-peak-season-how-to-guide-for-retailers/"},"hash":"gqDVMZ4qx1rjUAX5LMn3WBqzBUkOrFsFmYMMgiI+ZbE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"884996a2-42e0-4809-9534-60eb1aaf91ad","metadata":{"url":"https://proshipinc.com/blog/optimizing-your-shipping-strategy-a-peak-season-how-to-guide-for-retailers/"},"hash":"c+70+8jVT67YFoU61Q0ARlJsOeVuoHxFhT6qguxtzDI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2cb501e8-4b78-480c-86fe-312a2c908817","metadata":{},"hash":"GFBpb8spe0azqrpRx7WLsfO5yPyUbsiL2MtSGXcmk7o="}},"text":"This

Negotiate favorable rates with carriers and optimize your reverse logistics operations to reduce costs.By partnering with the right shipping software provider, retailers can both streamline their return processes and minimize expenses.Proactive Communication: Managing Expectations\nEffective communication is key to managing customer expectations.Proactively communicate with customers about potential shipping delays, order status updates, and any unforeseen issues.Transparent and timely communication can help mitigate customer frustration and maintain a positive brand image.By focusing on these key areas, retailers can significantly improve the customer experience and build lasting relationships with their customers.Omnichannel Fulfillment Strategies\nIn today’s digital age, customers expect a seamless shopping experience that transcends traditional boundaries.They want the freedom to shop anytime, anywhere, and on any device.Whether it’s browsing products online, picking up an order in-store, or receiving a delivery at their doorstep, customers demand a consistent and convenient experience.To meet these rising expectations, retailers must adopt an omnichannel fulfillment strategy.By adopting an omnichannel fulfillment strategy that optimizes shipping operations across multiple channels, retailers can improve customer satisfaction, increase sales, and reduce costs.[Dive deeper: The Parcel Pro’s Guide to Omnichannel Fulfillment]\nAccording to our recent survey (The ProShip Report 2024), 34% of retailers are leveraging in-store pickup options to offer greater convenience and faster delivery.Additionally, 26% of retailers are leveraging a distributed inventory network, storing and shipping inventory from multiple warehouses or fulfillment centers across different regions.29% prioritize integrated inventory data to ensure faster delivery options and enhance customer convenience.However, only 10% of retailers are currently partnering with a third-party logistics (3PL) provider.By outsourcing non-core logistics functions to a 3PL, retailers can focus on their core competencies, reduce operational costs, and improve shipping efficiency.[Why do 3PLs have such a bright future?]Other key strategies include:\nBuy Online, Pick Up In-Store (BOPIS): According to recent data, BOPIS penetration among top 500 retailers reached 82.7% in 2023.Do you want to be left behind by other retailers taking advantage of this strategy which allows customers to purchase items online and pick them up at a nearby store?It offers convenience and flexibility, especially during busy seasons.Curbside Pickup: The adoption of curbside pickup remains another growing fulfillment option at 47.5% in 2023.This option provides contactless pickup experience, where customers can order online and collect their items from a designated pickup location.Ship-from-Store (SFS): When online orders exceed inventory levels at a warehouse, retailers can fulfill orders directly from nearby stores.A ship-from-store strategy can help reduce shipping costs and improve delivery times – transforming the way retailers fulfill orders, while providing fast and convenient shipping options to meet the delivery expectations of online shoppers [Explore how Retail Giant Spencer’s is winning the omnichannel game with their Spirit Halloween pop-ups].Distributed Inventory Management (DIM): A distributed inventory network is a key component of DOM.By strategically locating inventory across multiple warehouses and fulfillment centers, retailers can optimize order fulfillment and reduce shipping times.This approach aligns with the 26% of retailers who are leveraging a distributed inventory network.Remember, a well-integrated technology stack is essential for executing a successful omnichannel fulfillment strategy.A robust technology infrastructure, including advanced warehouse management systems (WMS) and order management systems (OMS), and multi-carrier shipping software (MCSS) can help retailers facilitate the flow of information and inventory across the supply chain.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"v6ahb+U+W/U0m/t1e3w0cfgLhuiSi7SN8u7JPMnNgCo="},"2cb501e8-4b78-480c-86fe-312a2c908817":{"id_":"2cb501e8-4b78-480c-86fe-312a2c908817","metadata":{"url":"https://proshipinc.com/blog/optimizing-your-shipping-strategy-a-peak-season-how-to-guide-for-retailers/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6dc5f61e-9439-4e3b-9fef-d085aefa3bc5","metadata":{"url":"https://proshipinc.com/blog/optimizing-your-shipping-strategy-a-peak-season-how-to-guide-for-retailers/"},"hash":"gqDVMZ4qx1rjUAX5LMn3WBqzBUkOrFsFmYMMgiI+ZbE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"15c6ce6b-6a84-49cc-8315-469e25ebc44d","metadata":{"url":"https://proshipinc.com/blog/optimizing-your-shipping-strategy-a-peak-season-how-to-guide-for-retailers/"},"hash":"n1IHk+kZUdXozQbbQHl4eiEVN3wbLpab4powE6pwgDc="}},"text":"A

read\nDiscover if shippers are prioritizing cost over speed and the strategies to optimize both\nToday’s high-volume shippers face a complex challenge: balancing the need for rapid delivery times with the desire to minimize costs.As e-commerce continues to reshape the parcel and delivery landscape, the pressure to optimize shipping operations is intensifying.Dive in as we look closer at both cost and speed to explore strategies for achieving both efficiency and affordability.Cost Considerations\nCost is a significant factor in carrier selection, but it’s not always the top priority.While 23% of respondents in our recent survey [The ProShip Report 2024] ranked cost as the most important factor, a surprising 32% ranked it as the least important.This suggests that other factors, such as speed and reliability, may be more critical for certain businesses.To optimize shipping costs, high-volume shippers can consider several strategies:\nCarrier Selection: Many shippers are already using a multi-carrier shipping software.However, upgrading to an elite solution can offer significant benefits that a lower-grade software lacks, such as advanced rate shopping, versionless architecture for seamless updates, seamless integration with other top technology (OMS, WMS, ERP and more).This flexibility allows you to choose how you want to ship – whether that is with on-platform carrier engines or API connections.Negotiate favorable rates: Leverage your shipping volume to negotiate lower rates with carriers.Additionally, consider balancing your shipping volume across multiple carriers to avoid becoming overly reliant on a single carrier and potentially losing negotiating power.[Learn more about Carrier Volume Balancing]\nConsolidate shipments: By combining multiple smaller shipments into larger, consolidated shipments, shippers can often gain negotiating power with carriers.This can lead to significant cost savings, especially for shipments crossing several zones or moving long distances.Optimize packaging: Efficient packaging can reduce shipping costs by minimizing weight and dimensions.By using lightweight, durable materials and optimizing package size, shippers can save on shipping fees.Additionally, leveraging advanced packaging optimization software can help identify opportunities to reduce packaging waste and minimize shipping costs.Zone Skipping: By strategically consolidating shipments and avoiding additional handling fees at regional hubs, shippers can reduce transportation costs with zone skipping.This can be achieved by working closely with your carriers to identify optimal shipping routes and utilizing carrier-specific services.The other piece of the puzzle is a multi-carrier shipping software that can apply automated business logic to not only select the right carrier hub based on the package’s final destination, but also incorporate the cost of the line haul as part of the rate shopping comparison and produce all of the paperwork needed to execute the zone skip.Reverse Logistics: Implementing efficient reverse logistics processes can minimize costs associated with returns and exchanges.By streamlining the returns process and reducing handling time, shippers can reduce the financial impact of returns.Additionally, leveraging a shipping software that can automate return processing (think capabilities to implement complex business rules for your unique reverse logistics business) and generate return shipping labels can further optimize reverse logistics operations.[What other reverse logistics lessons should I learn?]Speed Considerations\nSpeed is another key factor that high-volume shippers consider.With increasingly demanding customers, prompt delivery is essential.However, prioritizing speed can come at a cost.Shippers must carefully evaluate their specific needs and select carriers that can provide the desired level of service without breaking the bank.According to the same survey of high-volume parcel shippers [The ProShip Report 2024], 18% of respondents ranked speed as the most important factor, and nearly 70% considered it somewhat important.To prioritize speed without sacrificing cost, consider the following strategies:\nCarrier Diversification & Rationalization: Choose carriers with a proven track record of delivering shipments on time.[What other factors should you consider for evaluating carriers?]Utilizing a carrier-agnostic multi-carrier shipping software with strong carrier relationships and industry-leading designations (such as FedEx Solution of the Year, FedEx Diamond Compatibility Partner, UPS Ready Partner) to access a broad parcel and LTL carrier library and negotiate preferential rates.To optimize speed and efficiency, be sure to research and rationalize the right carrier mix for your shipping profile.Incorporating last-mile, same-day, and next-day carriers can significantly improve delivery times, especially for high-value or time-sensitive shipments.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"sVm6pzYi1DNiCOtIVR2iws9Hy1FAZvQ+qhnLzc89ng8="},"1f9fccd8-1ad5-44de-8ea7-849ad33d264b":{"id_":"1f9fccd8-1ad5-44de-8ea7-849ad33d264b","metadata":{"url":"https://proshipinc.com/blog/the-parcel-shippers-dilemma-cost-vs-speed/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"404cecde-fb61-49c5-a350-ed3327895658","metadata":{"url":"https://proshipinc.com/blog/the-parcel-shippers-dilemma-cost-vs-speed/"},"hash":"wtGJ5hy2ceLmTR5naUK5cK5cH6+7/haxoiQG5rSliAY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"95b59015-33de-4fc2-85f5-aa952d94f291","metadata":{"url":"https://proshipinc.com/blog/the-parcel-shippers-dilemma-cost-vs-speed/"},"hash":"sVm6pzYi1DNiCOtIVR2iws9Hy1FAZvQ+qhnLzc89ng8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4358259b-5039-491e-942f-6298dd04bb3f","metadata":{},"hash":"GSSYb4VJGIFwFmYnm2zmTN37aLmddrCb6q89SgeK6n8="}},"text":"According

high-value or time-sensitive shipments.Additionally, strategically locating warehouses closer to your customers can reduce transit times and improve overall delivery performance.Utilize expedited shipping services: While standard ground service is the most common shipping method, high-volume shippers often leverage a mix of expedited, international, and same-day services [The ProShip Report 2024].Partner with a technology solution that can offer shipping software with advanced date shopping functionality to compare rates from multiple carriers, considering factors like time in transit, customer choice, and trailer pull time and more.This enables you to select the most cost-effective expedited service for each shipment.Leverage real-time tracking: Use shipment reporting technology to track shipments in real-time and proactively act on your shipping data.While your shipping software can provide some tracking information, specialized tracking solutions offer more advanced features, such as predictive analytics, exception management, and proactive notifications.It’s important to choose a tracking solution that integrates seamlessly with your shipping software to provide a comprehensive view of your shipping operations.Inventory Management: Implement effective inventory management strategies to ensure products are readily available for shipment.Shipping software can help optimize inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and improve order fulfillment accuracy.When fully integrated with warehouse management systems (WMS), the shipping software can provide real-time visibility into inventory levels, allowing for more efficient order fulfillment.[Want to learn more about what a unified enterprise software stack looks like?]To enhance omnichannel fulfillment and improve delivery speed, consider implementing a distributed inventory strategy and utilizing stores, distribution centers, and third-party logistics (3PL) providers as fulfillment locations.By strategically placing inventory closer to your customers, you can reduce transit times and improve overall delivery performance.This can be especially beneficial for e-commerce businesses that need to fulfill orders quickly and efficiently.Balancing Cost and Speed with ProShip\nAs we’ve explored, the delicate balance between cost and speed is a critical challenge for high-volume shippers.By

CHAIN MANAGEMENT\nJuly 26 2019 05:40 AM\nShipping: The Only Constant Is Change\nBy Justin Cramer\n1\n1\n2\n4\nTotal Shares\nWhile shipping may seem simple to customers (or even company executives), shipping managers know that it’s anything but.Much more goes into shipping than simply getting the order from the warehouse to the customer’s home.Shippers must take into account when the customer wants to receive their order, the packaging and, of course, the shipping costs.They must also keep up with the latest technologies and regulations in the constantly changing shipping industry.Case in point: dimensional (DIM) weight.It’s hard to believe, but DIM weight was first introduced to ground shipments only four years ago.Before then, shippers were simply charged for the weight of their shipment, no matter the size of the parcel.All of that changed when two of the largest carriers, FedEx and UPS, introduced DIM weight pricing for all ground shipments.As many know, DIM weight is normally calculated for ground shipments by the length, width, and height of each parcel that is over three cubic feet, regardless of the shipment’s weight.This was a big change for shippers in 2015, especially since many of them experienced significantly higher shipping costs – some as high as 30%.Unfortunately, these DIM weight rates are only continuing to increase each year, forcing many shippers to continue to find new ways to combat these higher shipping charges as to avoid impacting their bottom line.For this reason, shippers are constantly reviewing their shipping procedures and turning to different solutions and shipping strategies.By leveraging the following strategies, companies can exponentially reduce shipping costs while still meeting customer demands.Renegotiate shipping contracts with multiple carriers.Before reaching out to your main shipping carriers to negotiate better rates and update contracts, obtain rates from all viable carriers.It may seem obvious, but knowing what company offers the lowest rate can help you negotiate with your current carriers, as well as update your contract.Your carrier is able to review the number of parcels your company shipped per day/month/year and the average parcel size so they can create a unique contract designed just for your business.This will dramatically save on shipping costs and help boost business.Consider a variety of carriers, including both regional and local.Many companies may not realize local couriers can transport shipments 80 to 100 miles within a specified zone.This is an excellent mode of transportation for last-mile delivery as it can provide a personalized, caring service for customers.Regional carriers also offer longer time schedules for pick-up and delivery, and they can even provide next-day delivery options to meet customer expectations.These carriers are especially beneficial for shippers as these services are oftentimes more cost-effective than large carriers, and not all utilize DIM weight surcharges.Design packaging with DIM weight in mind.It’s no surprise DIM weight charges impact large lightweight items the most.However, all oversized parcels are losing shippers money.This is why it’s critical shippers design packaging that better fits these items in order to create the smallest parcel possible.To do this, shippers can begin stocking many different types of parcel sizes in order to create these custom-fit packages.However, some shippers have found this strategy is not always feasible due to warehouse space.In these cases, shippers incorporate automated packaging solutions into the order fulfillment process.These systems measure, construct, tape, weigh, and label each order while creating a fit-to-size package.These parcels can be created in as little as seven seconds using only one operator, which allows for better efficiencies.These systems can also auto-box thousands of single- or multi-item orders per day, creating fit-to-size parcels with the lowest DIM weight.Rate shop carriers and services using multi-carrier shipping software.Many shippers turn to shipping software that automatically rate shops their carriers and services to identify the best shipping option for every order, no matter the DIM weight.These shippers have found they can save a minimum of six percent in shipping costs and have increased savings with many different regional carriers and services, even without established contracts.Rate shopping also provides shippers with increased negotiating powers when the time comes to renegotiate with their current carrier contracts.While DIM weight surcharges are a constant pain point for shippers, there are many strategies and solutions that can be incorporated into the fulfillment process that alleviate increased shipping costs.From updating contracts to utilizing multiple shipping carriers to new technologies, these solutions are easy to incorporate and can save you thousands.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"U/4fsKctbJwHI46FqbqxMBFmDwdGRyS1IxP0SWmEebE="},"6daa341e-66c1-4b69-ad28-44cfdf35f45d":{"id_":"6daa341e-66c1-4b69-ad28-44cfdf35f45d","metadata":{"url":"https://parcelindustry.com/article-5294-Shipping-The-Only-Constant-Is-Change.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ef22047e-6ed9-4e2b-873a-ca52dbe5ed6b","metadata":{"url":"https://parcelindustry.com/article-5294-Shipping-The-Only-Constant-Is-Change.html"},"hash":"AUfzawj8D3EirerFK79f0ZQX56IzXvIcVtXq3PZ8aOY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c33f488d-2987-4446-9438-3f27ca15353c","metadata":{"url":"https://parcelindustry.com/article-5294-Shipping-The-Only-Constant-Is-Change.html"},"hash":"U/4fsKctbJwHI46FqbqxMBFmDwdGRyS1IxP0SWmEebE="}},"text":"These

expectations today are shifting to instant satisfaction. People want to know if the item they want is available, where it’s coming from and how quickly they can get it. This puts a lot of pressure on retailers, distribution centers, third party logistics (3PL) providers and carriers as they all work together to achieve the same goal – getting orders out to customers as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n[FREE White Paper]\nHow Shipping Software Will Boost Your Business\nDownload White Paper\nHowever, cost-effective shipping can be a challenge because each shipment can potentially involve multiple carriers with numerous levels of services and constantly changing rates. Intricate business rules and shipping restrictions for parcels that differ in size and weight, include anything fragile, hazardous or perishable, or are shipped outside of the country further complicate the process.\nIn our white paper, “How Shipping Software Will Boost Your Business“, you’ll learn about:\n8 reasons why you should streamline your shipping process\nThe impact of inventory visibility and control\nBetter transport and logistics\nBetter shipping cost management\nShipping software features and benefits\nAnd so much more!\nAccording to “Shipping as a Marketing Tool for Boosting Sales” by Nadine Devisch, “Shipping has a major role to play in the overall online shopping experience.” As Ms. Devisch explains, “Shipping should be considered from the moment initial contact with the customer is made.”\nProShip software ensures cost effective shipping with every shipment.\nFurthermore, a report carried out by the European Commission in 2013, highlights that shipping strongly influences customer loyalty. It appears that the major reasons a customer makes a repeat online purchase are linked to logistics and transport such as free shipping, return options, delivery times and shipping updates. Shipping is therefore important not only to logistics experts, but also to sales and marketing specialists as it is an ideal tool for conversion and customer retention.\nAdopting the right shipping strategy can give companies a competitive advantage, while providing an outstanding customer experience.

Things Every Retailer Should Know About Parcel Lockers Ahead of the Holiday Season\nClick-and-collect lockers can be a competitive advantage and enhance the customer experience\nSeptember 06, 2017 11:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time\nBROOKFIELD, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--According to UPS, more than half of shoppers are interested in an alternate delivery location with extended hours and lower fees.In fact, 35 percent of these shoppers prefer parcel lockers.With large retailers, such as Amazon, already adding parcel locker stations as a convenient final-mile delivery option, it’s time for all retailers to consider the benefits of this click and collect solution for their customers ahead of the holiday season.“With Amazon introducing parcel lockers as another convenient delivery method for its customers, all retailers should also be aware of how this click and collect solution can benefit their customers”\nPost this\nProShip, Inc., a Neopost company and a leader in logistics software and supply chain solutions, has provided the following tips to help retailers evaluate the benefits of parcel lockers for their business and their customers just in time for the holidays.Five key benefits of parcel lockers:\n1.Parcel lockers provide a free, convenient delivery and returns process.Customers want a quick and efficient way to receive their items.With parcel lockers on-site, they can do just that in three simple steps.When an order is delivered and placed into a parcel locker, the customer receives a notification via email or SMS message with a one-time PIN code or QR code.The customer goes to the parcel locker station and enters the code.The parcel locker door opens and the customer can retrieve the order.Not only is this system convenient for customers, but it allows a complete chain of custody – an added security for retailers.The returns process is just as easy.Customers simply drop off their returns at a parcel locker station rather than mailing through a carrier or standing in line at the service desk.They place the return label on their parcel, scan the label at the parcel locker station and place the parcel in the locker that opens.Once secured, retailers can process the returned orders at a convenient time for them.2.Parcel lockers can be placed inside or outside your store.Parcel lockers can be placed inside a brick and mortar store or outside the storefront to not only offer an additional delivery method to customers, but to also increase in-store traffic.But it isn’t just the retailers who are satisfied with more in-store foot traffic, customers also enjoy the added benefit of walking through the store to see what’s new.And with outdoor, weather-resistant parcel lockers, customers can pick up their orders 24/7 for instant customer satisfaction and convenience.3.Parcel lockers can be customized with your brand and a configuration that works for you.Extend your branding to your parcel lockers by incorporating your logo and color palette to match the store’s interior and exterior appearance.This will not only strengthen your brand, but will direct customers to the parcel lockers.Retailers can also configure the parcel locker station to include lockers in a variety of sizes so every customer order will fit into this easy click and collect system.4.Parcel lockers reduce shipping costs.As final-mile delivery costs continue to grow and customers expect fast, free shipping, parcel lockers allow retailers to offer a free final-mile delivery option to their customers.They also save on shipping costs.Instead of shipping hundreds or thousands of small orders to residences, retailers can use their own transportation to ship bulk orders to the brick and mortar store for placement into the parcel lockers.5.Parcel lockers offer robust reporting capabilities.Parcel lockers offer reports and metrics on a number of key performance indicators, including occupancy, turnover, pickup times, parcel size and more.This enables retailers to determine their return on investment as well as the need for additional parcel locker stations on site.“With Amazon introducing parcel lockers as another convenient delivery method for its customers, all retailers should also be aware of how this click and collect solution can benefit their customers,” said Gaven Rolfe, Western Regional Territory Manager of Packcity and ProShip.“By using parcel lockers as another delivery option this holiday season, customer satisfaction, and thus customer loyalty, increases.With growing customer demand for fast, free delivery, retailers of all sizes can benefit from this convenient final-mile delivery solution.”","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0221vn1EwiEtTfbRWYHAaEUuqh751Ex95wDXaQTouVI="},"2946edd6-22c0-449d-9548-7a81220922b5":{"id_":"2946edd6-22c0-449d-9548-7a81220922b5","metadata":{"url":"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170906006302/en/Five-Things-Every-Retailer-Should-Know-About-Parcel-Lockers-Ahead-of-the-Holiday-Season"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bd8ea694-9424-42d2-8f82-bf79aa0114cf","metadata":{"url":"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170906006302/en/Five-Things-Every-Retailer-Should-Know-About-Parcel-Lockers-Ahead-of-the-Holiday-Season"},"hash":"ySKDCz/xGGZo0243pgroP5rXQruE5iGeQ+4g3QbK4/g="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"74f09dc2-c0dd-42fa-8615-e66e2f246c44","metadata":{"url":"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170906006302/en/Five-Things-Every-Retailer-Should-Know-About-Parcel-Lockers-Ahead-of-the-Holiday-Season"},"hash":"0221vn1EwiEtTfbRWYHAaEUuqh751Ex95wDXaQTouVI="}},"text":"Instead

Freight\nwww.3gtms.com\n3Gtms’ transportation management system (TMS) enables third-party logistics providers (3PLs) and logistics service providers (LSPs) to operate more sustainably through reducing fuel consumption and emissions during the transport of goods.The TMS incorporates optimization algorithms that help determine more efficient routes and ensure each route is maximized in terms of truck space.Clients report increased shipment consolidation, more efficient routes (and fewer miles traveled) and optimized truckloads.For instance, Bemis Manufacturing’s mix of freight changes drastically from day to day, so the company relies on 3Gtms’ TMS to help easily and quickly choose between all of its transportation options, and find the most efficient way to move freight.ALOM\nA Sustainable IT-Driven Strategy\nwww.alom.com\nALOM worked with one of its medical device clients to design and implement a sustainable IT-driven strategy to expand its e-commerce-only order delivery protocol to

(EDI) systems to receive orders by ALOM and feed them via application program interface (API) to the client for visibility.This solution improved the client’s sustainability by providing: paperless, real-time retail order management and tracking; reduced transportation time, cost and distance traveled per unit; a sustainable retail packaging design; and in-transit serial number tracking for automated delivery status notification.ALOM’s client saw a more than 40 percent reduction in per-unit transportation cost versus online fulfillment.By the Numbers: ALOM’s client saw a more than 40

recovery services program maximizes the return on investment of a company’s end-of-life or surplus IT equipment, while also mitigating compliance risks when the equipment is refurbished, remarketed or recycled.The company believes that the most important aspect of asset recovery is the recycling process of end-of-life equipment.Its R2 standard certification—which focuses on the performance of electronics recyclers in environmental and public health, employee health and safety, security (data and facility), and the whole of the recycling process through final equipment disposition—confirms the company’s commitment to responsible recycling.Alantix customers see the results of green IT by reducing their footprint of electronic waste (e-waste), which is produced when electronic equipment is not properly disposed.B-Stock Solutions\nLiquidation Marketplace Diverts Hard-to-Sell Items from Landfills\nwww.bstock.com\nB-Stock Solutions operates a large network of business-to-business (B2B)

marketplace—for inventory of all conditions—B-Stock’s clients enabled the recycling, repurposing, reuse or resale of just under 70 million items through a total of 137,473 auctions to date.In the past

damages/shortages and lowering total logistics costs.Consolidation programs help conserve natural resources by reducing dock congestion, improving warehouse efficiencies and decreasing the number of trucks on the highway.The resulting supply chain consumes less energy and produces lower amounts of carbon emissions.Fewer trucks on the road results in fewer interactions with motorists and safer highways.CaseStack’s retailer partners experience: increased supplier price competition, increased inventory turns, lower order minimums, decreased safety stock levels, decreased inventory costs, increased efficiency, decreased vendor management time and costs, decreased dock congestion and decreased lead times.Cass Information Systems Inc.\nDigitizing and Reducing the Paper

}\nPrint\nShare\nGroceryRetail\nStores as Fulfillment Centers\nElevating Retail in the Digital Era with Innovative Strategies\n Joanne Heyob\nOver the past decade, we have watched companies fight tooth and nail for their survival amid the industry’s metamorphic digital revolution.The retail apocalypse is raging on more aggressively than ever, and previously dominant brands are now suffering from losses that are forcing them to abandon hundreds of their brick-and-mortar locations.With approximately 5,000 store closures in 2018 and over 15 retail retailers in the United States filing for bankruptcy, the retail landscape is undergoing a profound transformation.1\nEcommerce is now the reigning retail royalty, shuttering shopping centers and department stores faster than you can say “two-day Prime shipping.”With this sector of the market expanding at such a rapid rate, big box retailers and ecommerce companies are exploring innovative approaches to stay relevant in this evolving industry.No one in 2004 would have looked at the shopping mall as something to be pushed into obscurity; you likely would’ve been too busy shopping at Elder-Beerman or browsing the newest selection at Blockbuster (RIP), scoffing at the idea of buying apparel or renting movies from home on Amazon.com.But 15 years later, these once bustling retail hubs are now harboring thousands of square feet of unused space that is up for the taking.And who is vying for this real estate?Companies prioritizing (and expanding) ecommerce.Retailers are actively pursuing these spaces, recognizing the potential for centralized distribution centers.Industrial property availability has hit a 20-year low at 7%, while demand for these spaces outpaced supply by 29 million square feet in 2018.2 Despite zoning roadblocks, retail properties, especially those in close proximity to population centers, offer ideal locations for warehouse space.The vase spaces left behind by department stores in malls, averaging around 250,000 square feet, present valuable opportunities for companies seeking warehouse solutions.To put the value of this into perspective, Wall Street has concluded that Macy’s real estate is worth twice the amount of the company at around $16 billion.3\nAmazon, a key player in reshaping the retail industry, is acquiring former shopping malls to strategically position fulfillment centers across the United States.This not only strengthens their competition with brick-and-mortar retailers but also improves delivery speed and supply chain efficiency.Ohio is at the forefront of this trend, and ecommerce continues to redefine the retail landscape, the conversion of stores into distribution centers is poised to grow.Seeing how Amazon is utilizing this tactic to expand their already dominant reach, what can competitors do in order to keep up?The easiest and possibly most obvious solution is to turn portions of their stores into mini distribution centers.Walmart, for example, has over 4,500 supercenters sprinkled across the United States with a majority of them mainly serving one purpose: to provide those who come directly into the store with merchandise.4 BOPIS is a popular fulfillment option offered by many of these big box retailers, but it is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the opportunities that their physical locations provide when it comes to getting products in the hands of consumers.To put it bluntly, the back of the house in these facilities needs an extensive reorganization.This portion of stores hasn’t been truly updated since the ’90s, and a change in supply chain is essential in the battle against the successful variety of online shipping methods.90% of consumers say that free or reduced shipping costs are a hugely important factor when it comes to making online purchases.5 So much so that more than 80% said that they have decided to cancel a purchase and seek out other options on account of unfavorable shipping costs.5 Turning these stores into partial distribution centers not only streamlines the shipping process but also enhances brand loyalty by delivering products faster.The inventory and consumer data is already available, the space is already there, and the existing employees can easily transition from associates to stockers.So why haven’t more companies implemented this mini fulfillment center strategy?Concerns about its effectiveness and ROI are likely the most halting reasons.No one wants to be the one to try something and fail, becoming the cautionary tale of what not to do in the industry for years to come.Target, though, has already taken this leap of faith and is happily reaping the benefits.Brian Cornell, Target’s CEO, feels that the transformation is, “placing our stores at the center of a modern network design to deliver an unmatched combination of convenient fulfillment options.”","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YTo4f9DceHYCzqLqOV4PLa/95huNbac36u6f+ixarN0="},"75c98478-c08b-4311-a68e-e569b66e0cfd":{"id_":"75c98478-c08b-4311-a68e-e569b66e0cfd","metadata":{"url":"https://www.wdpartners.com/wayfind/stores-as-fulfillment-centers/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"251146c2-5d0d-4587-a58e-c57626546e8a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.wdpartners.com/wayfind/stores-as-fulfillment-centers/"},"hash":"y3LxcYDCjIMkFFSamDKPQIkJ34JUEKBfTqdfmb5qCXY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"91fb5fe9-4e8a-4e8b-8b6c-d3e9163491d0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.wdpartners.com/wayfind/stores-as-fulfillment-centers/"},"hash":"YTo4f9DceHYCzqLqOV4PLa/95huNbac36u6f+ixarN0="}},"text":"5

order, an in-store pickup order, or a traditional ecommerce purchase.Walmart is another retail giant making strides in this direction, prioritizing innovative strategies like BOPIS, ship-from-store, and ecommerce offerings.Their BOPIS, ship-from-store and ecommerce offerings are consumer favorites in addition to their free two-day shipping option that requires no outrageous membership fees.The dedication to training employees for streamlined fulfillment processes positions them as top players in the retail industry.Other companies are also recognizing the importance of this concept, rapidly implementing fulfillment options to meet digital demands and reduce shipping costs.Kohls, for example, has equipped over 130 stores with this fulfillment option this year in order to keep up with digital demands and cut shipping costs.At this time last year, only ten of their stores offered this service.1 To compete with ecommerce giants, retailers must offer consumers diverse fulfillment options, allowing for flexibility in receiving and returning items.To successfully continue on with their battle against Amazon’s market wrath, retailers need to take note of the efforts of Kohls’ and Target that allow shoppers true freedom when it comes to receiving and returning their items.With ecommerce giants’ seemingly endless fulfillment offerings setting them apart from the crowd, big boxers may as well join in on the fun and cater to all of consumer’s most desired ordering and receiving methods right in the stores they began in.Without taking swift and deliberate measures, the glut of open space brought on by the retail apocalypse will continue on its merry (and debilitating) path.Thankfully, WD has the knowhow to make sure your business doesn't fall victim to this retail
