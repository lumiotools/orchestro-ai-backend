But while initiatives like these are important, there’s another opportunity for merchants to maximize their return on investment (ROI) that’s often overlooked:\\n‍Improving the profitability of a shop’s return process.\\nRoughly 25% of consumers return as much as 15% of their online orders—and each return comes with costs that negatively impact your business. To maximize your ecommerce ROI, you need to follow these three rules to ensure expenses related to returns aren’t hurting your profitability.\\nRule #1: Reduce shipping costs when restocking inventory \\nIf your return policy allows customers to send items back in exchange for a refund or store credit, you may have some flexibility regarding where your returns are sent.\\nImagine that your business stores merchandise in warehouses located in New York and California. \\nIf a customer in Oregon purchases an item that’s in stock at your New York location, you’ll have no choice but to ship it cross-country from there. But if they initiate a return of the item, having it delivered to your California warehouse (rather than New York origin) could help you reduce return shipping fees.\\nA few other considerations you’ll want to keep in mind when it comes to reducing shipping costs on restocked inventory include:\\nWhether your ecommerce shopping cart system gives you the flexibility to assign return destinations by product category, by the item’s size and weight, or by individual product SKUs. \\nIf your e-commerce solution doesn’t offer this ability natively, you may need to investigate whether integrating with a third-party technology provider makes sense.\\nThe average distance between your locations and your customers\\nIf you have several warehouse locations around the country, reducing shipping costs in this way is more viable than if you only have a single location.\\nThe sophistication of your reverse logistics network\\nIf you plan to send returns to warehouses, distribution centers (DCs), or other physical locations, do these facilities have the capabilities required to process returns and restock inventory that didn’t originate from the location?\\nIf you partner with drop-shippers…\\nEvaluate whether setting return locations based on product SKUs so that you don’t have to involve your drop-shipping partners in the return process may make sense.\\nOne more thing…\\n‍\\nKeep in mind that streamlining your returns process by utilizing multiple locations may also help to get your returned stock back on the shelves as quickly as possible. In turn, this may increase your odds of being able to resell merchandise at full value, rather than having to discount items that are no longer in peak demand.\\nRule #2: Set longer return windows for VIP customers \\nGenerally speaking, shorter return windows come with financial benefits. Not only are you more likely to be able to resell returned items at full price, but reconverting resold items into revenue more quickly limits the impact of outstanding returns on your working capital and keeps your financial records more accurate.\\nThat said, longer return periods are in your customers’ best interest. Consumers don’t want to be rushed, and global shipping delays associated mean they may not be comfortable taking a chance on a retailer with a shorter return window.\\nFortunately, there is a middle ground: setting a longer return window for your best customers only. \\nAlthough companies like Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, and DSW already offer tiered VIP return benefits, Narvar’s 2021 Return Policy Benchmark Report found that only 9% of retailers across Fortune 50 retailers, omnichannel merchants, and direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands offer them.\\nBy offering longer return windows to your top customers based on lifetime spend or loyalty program enrollment, you encourage future orders while also reducing costs through shorter windows applied to the bulk of your buyers.\\nRule #3: Charge a conditional restocking fee \\nOne final rule to consider implementing is a conditional restocking fee that allows you to assess additional charges in certain cases. For example, you might charge conditional restocking fees:\\nWhen customers are returning items that are above a certain weight or size, for which you’ll incur exceptionally high return shipping fees.\\nWhen international customers need to return items to your domestic facilities.\\nTo shoppers who aren’t enrolled in your loyalty program (or in a specific loyalty program tier that offers free shipping perks).\\nAs a retailer, you have a lot of discretion here. Reviewing the return shipping charges billed to your company in the past can be a helpful way to identify patterns where conditional restocking fees may be helpful. Just be sure that any policies you implement are clearly defined in key areas of your site to prevent confusion or frustration among customers.\\nFinally, be cautious when implementing return policies that have the potential to disrupt your customers’ experience during the reverse logistics process—96% of customers who rate their return experience positively say they’ll shop with that retailer again. Be sure any approach you take to maximize ROI through your return rules balances both financial benefits and the benefits of creating a positive returns experience. \\nNarvar Team\\n‍\\nShare this Story\\nRelated Categories\\nEcommerce\\nMost Recent\\nBoost Upsell Revenue: Smart Product Recommendations for Retailers\\nE-commerce CRO: 4 Easy Conversion Rate Optimization Tips\\nThe Power of Retailer Subscription Programs\\nWhat is Retail Return Fraud?

All of which is to say offering “free shipping” or “ free returns” seems like a questionable idea for furniture retailers looking to stay profitable. However, failing to offer shoppers at least one of these freebies is risky—it could mean missing out on sales to your competitors.  \\nSo, what’s a furniture retailer like you to do?\\nWell, you need to start by taking a serious look at what “free” means for your future growth, because it could be the best investment you ever make.  \\nThe case for free returns in furniture retail\\nFurniture shoppers want a smooth, seamless returns process, and that almost always means “free” too. The downside for furniture retailers like you is that the return costs for your products are high, with packaging playing a significant role (more on that later).\\nThe key, then, is to think about the return on investment for offering free returns instead of dwelling on the upfront costs.\\nDo free returns lead to more repeat sales and growing customer lifetime value? \\nDoes offering free returns allow your customer service team to focus on other crucial areas of the business?\\nDo free returns lead to more positive reviews and customer referrals, both of which contribute to higher net-new sales? \\nHow you answer those questions will determine whether offering free returns makes sense. As you weigh your answers, consider these numbers…\\nAccording to a roundup of studies on returns:\\nFree return shipping can increase long-term profits by 25%\\n80% of shoppers say return policies impact either current or future sales\\n66% of shoppers read returns policies ahead of a purchase\\nHassle-free returns can boost repeat shoppers by up to 75%\\n55% of shoppers view restocking fees as a reason not to buy from you\\nWhen free shipping makes sense in furniture retail\\nFree shipping is an offer every business owner knows because it works—88% of shoppers will always choose an option with free shipping. In other words, offering people free shipping is correlated with increased order volumes, higher average order values, and a general boost to conversion.\\nFor furniture retailers, the real question with free shipping is: “At what level does this make sense?”\\nPut another way, at what product price point do the costs of free shipping make financial sense to your business? This isn’t an easy question to answer. If free shipping facilitates a 5% increase in online sales, you need to figure out if that’s enough additional revenue is enough to offset the expense. \\nNow, because the average order value is usually high in the furniture retail business, offering shoppers free shipping is doable. Especially if your company partners with a third-party logistics provider (3PL) to optimize flat-pack packaging based on DIM weight (and other factors) to drive down fulfillment costs. \\n(Sound too good to be true?—Then look at your competitors. See how often they advertise free shipping. If their customers look like your customers (i.e., same shopper profile), it’s a good bet that your competitors are seeing growth in total order volume by sacrificing a small amount of per-sale margin.)\\nA quick note on affordability\\nIf you’re a furniture seller (especially in the flat-pack world), affordability is always on your mind—what will a free return (or free shipping) offer cost, and when does a “free” offer transition from an asset to a liability? \\nThe fact is, shipping costs for furniture scale quickly. Trying to get a customer to disassemble their furniture safely, put it back in the original box (with all the padding and cushioning), and returning that box safely to your warehouse or store feels like an exercise in futility. Take that into account when you’re thinking about returns and affordability. \\nA few other considerations you need to make…\\nWhat’s the TOTAL cost of a return (including shipping, QA, testing, repackaging, restocking, etc.)?\\nCan you strengthen padding and in-fill for returns protection (or use larger, sturdier packaging) for increased protection without increased costs, if you’re paying based on DIM weight?\\nCan you increase the cost of your items to cover a free shipping or return offer?\\nHave you asked customers what they prefer? Shipping or returns?\\nAnd don’t forget to consider packaging in all of this. Anything you do to reduce shipping costs (e.g., slimming down packaging weight) must not prevent customers from reusing your packaging for the  return process. Doing so will help you provide more reliable estimates and better control costs by reducing the number of customer service requests you receive from people who need a new box or can’t play packaging Tetris as well as your warehouse staff. \\nDo you need to choose “either-or”?\\nMany online furniture retailers approach “free” offers as an either-or situation. They feel like they can afford either free returns or free shipping, but not both, because the costs are too difficult to absorb. \\nDo not get sucked into this trap—challenge yourself to offer both free returns and free shipping as a way to jumpstart customer demand and fuel new sales. More often than not, seeing “Free shipping, free returns” is the straw that breaks the tentative shopper’s back, compelling them to finally click “buy.” \\nAnd if you must pick one or the other?—Well, examine your ideal customer profile, think about which option they’d prefer, and move forward accordingly.\\nAlex Selwitz\\nAlex Selwitz is the Director of SEO for Red Stag Fulfillment, an eCommerce fulfillment warehouse that was born out of eCommerce.

Specifically, start by embracing opportunities to make your returns process faster and more efficient. Anywhere from 13% to 20% of all retail purchases are returned. By encouraging faster returns, you'll expand available inventory for future purchases and you're more likely to recoup the cost of the item via resale. To help you get on your way, here are 5 ways to get returns back faster to your business.\\nIncentivize customers to initiate returns faster \\nThe sooner merchandise is returned to inventory, the more likely it is to be sold at full price. Taking a tiered approach to your return policy is an excellent way to balance customer expectations with your own financial considerations. Consider offering certain VIP shoppers an extended return window, while encouraging less-valuable one-off buyers to get their returns back faster.\\nFor example, Saks Fifth Avenue offers free shipping on returns initiated within 14 days of the ship date. For returns outside that window, Saks deducts $9.95 from  customer’s refund to cover shipping on return.\\nAnother example?—Sephora. They only offer credit to customers on the original form of payment for returns received within 30 days of purchase. For those received between 31 and 60 days of purchase, they only offer store credit.\\nAdd convenience to the return process\\nCustomers want value, but they also want complete convenience. When it comes to returns, that means retailers need to offer methods that don’t involve re-boxing products, printing return labels, or waiting in line at the post office. Tap into a broad network of return locations as it's the natural next step beyond the traditional third-party carrier return process.\\nWhile the majority of retail returns are made in-store or by mail, shoppers are willing to explore a wide-variety of return methods including curbside drop off, home pickup, and drop off at a third-party location. The more frequently shoppers utilize alternative return methods, the more they will come to expect them.In an age where convenience is expected, it’s critical that merchants provide a wider array of return choices such as home pickup, digital returns, standard courier return shipping, buy online, return in store (BORIS), and digital-to-physical returns through a partner network.\\nAmazon's offered this service for years by leveraging a partnership with Kohl’s and by acquiring Whole Foods Market to utilize as a brick-and-mortar drop-off point for ecommerce returns. \\n(Established in a similar vein, Narvar Concierge provides a network of more than 200,000 return drop-off locations for retailers, offering customers a way to make returns at Walgreens, Nordstrom, Simon Malls, Mall of America, and more.)\\nBoxless returns and labelless returns are another alternative. Boxless returns through The UPS Store make it easy for consumers to return ecommerce purchases. The store associates scan a QR code from the customer’s smartphone and accept the return—no packaging or label printing required.\\nSimilarly, home pickup allows customers schedule a courier to retrieve a return from their doorstep, resulting in 30% faster return times and sky-high net promoter scores.\\nOptimize routing for fast processing \\nWhere should returned merchandise go—to a brick and mortar store or back to a distribution center?\\nSelecting a destination for returns should be a proactive business calculation for retailers. Some retailers prefer to reduce shipping costs by accepting returns at their brick and mortar store locations; others rely on distribution centers for assessing damage and repackaging. There’s no one-size-fits all solution, but retailers can use an online return portal to encourage the behavior they want.\\nFor example, if an in-store return is preferred, you can charge a nominal return shipping fee to dissuade customers from mailing an item back. Or if you already offer free return shipping, persuade customers to elect curbside returns for faster refund timelines. Whichever approach you decide to take, just remember that communication is key—return policies and procedures should be explained clearly on your website, as well as in order confirmation and return merchandise authorization (RMA) emails.\\nSet your team up for success\\nSmart processes save retailers time and money. On the customer service side, investing in an automated, branded returns portal streamlines the process for customers, and gives representatives bandwidth to deal with more complex issues like lost packages and quality control. For the customer, an automated return process creates an instant gratification, letting them handle the return on their own schedule. Customers who have to wait hours or days for an RMA to trickle through a service queue are less likely to be happy with the experience.\\nOn the fulfillment side, make sure your warehouse team knows how to process returns quickly into your inventory management software (IMS). Quick processing is important for two reasons.\\nAdding merchandise back into the flow of commerce with speed increases the odds for resale.\\nCustomers want their money back, so processing refunds as soon as possible increases your customer satisfaction rating. \\nUse past return data to inform decisions and prevent future returns \\nMost retailers ask customers to choose a reason for their return when initiating a return online. That data is useful in identifying trends, updating product descriptions, and making future inventory decisions. Therefore, make sure you audit and update your “reason for return” options at least once a year. \\nAccording to Narvar’s 2022 State of Returns Report, the most common reason for returns is fit—a reason generally accounted for in a returns menu, along with color, quality, and changed mind.\\nConsumers are getting bigger, with adult obesity increasing from 27% to 32% between 2011 and 2020. When people shop, they aren’t always conscious of changes to their body —especially with the surge in online shopping over the last two years. While you can’t control the physical changes of your customers, you can help them make the right size choice by enhancing your product detail pages through the inclusion of augmented reality, sharper photography (featuring multiple models), customer reviews, product FAQ, and more.\\nOf course, “doesn’t fit” is an overly broad term that doesn’t explain if the item was too big or too small, so flesh out the reason options in a way that can inform product descriptions and business decisions. \\nA fashion retailer, for example, might include the following options in their reasons for return:\\nToo small\\nToo big\\nDidn’t like material/quality\\nColor looked different in person\\nChanged mind\\nBetter price available elsewhere\\nPurchase multiple items to compare\\nOther\\nWith that information, a retailer can identify quality control issues that warrant changes in manufacturing partners or whether the product description (and photography) is inaccurate.\\nIncluding the option of “purchased multiple items,” retailers can determine how many customers are bracketing.\\nAnd, by allowing customers to select more than one reason—instead of only the \\\"main\\\" reason—retailers can gather more data points to shape future decisions.\\nIn sum...\\nCustomers want a generous return policy, hassle-free shipping options, and quick refunds.\\nRetailers want to build customer loyalty, increase revenue, and minimize the need for returns.\\nMake this the year that you and your brand commit to overhauling your return process so that you can keep customers happy and get returns back faster.\\nNarvar Team\\n‍\\nShare this Story\\nRelated Categories\\nReturns, Supply Chain\\nMost Recent\\nBoost Upsell Revenue: Smart Product Recommendations for Retailers\\nE-commerce CRO: 4 Easy Conversion Rate Optimization Tips\\nThe Power of Retailer Subscription Programs\\nWhat is Retail Return Fraud?

Here are seven best practices for processing returns on Shopify.\\nAdopt a simple return policy \\nA great Shopify return policy is explainable in a few sentences, and features key details such as the number of days a customer has to start a return and how refunds are issued. \\nPolicies that offer 30-days to initiate a return and receive a full-refund are something of the ecommerce standard.\\nBeyond time limits, a simple return policy should stick to other core details such as:\\nHow an item may be returned\\nWhat way the customer will be credited \\nInstructions on how to start the return process\\nConvert returns to exchanges or store credit\\nReturns don’t need to equate to refunds—exchanges and store credit are fantastic alternatives.\\n Lululemon, for example, offers a Fast Track refund option, allowing shoppers returning three or fewer new items to receive a refund via e-gift card within two hours of dropping their items off at a FedEx or USPS location (rather than waiting days or weeks for the return to be received, processed, and approved at the warehouse). \\nShopify can utilize the Narvar Returns & Exchanges app to turn up to 60% of returns into exchanges. After entering their order information and reason for return, the customer can exchange their purchase for a different item or size, giving the retailer a better chance of retaining revenue. \\nAutomate the return flow\\nEcommerce thrives on the thrill of immediacy. If you don’t make the customer wait hours for a purchase confirmation, why would you make them wait hours for a return confirmation? Shopify retailers can use Narvar’s Shopify app to initiate a return, offer feedback for why they’re making the return, and receive instant confirmation and instructions for next steps. Shopify retailers can even automatically extend special return perks to VIP customers or decline returns from blacklisted customers. \\nGet ahead of WISMR \\nOnce a return is underway, customers want a refund or exchange to be processed within 30 days. Thanks to instant refunds and credits, many ecommerce customers expect their money even faster—in a matter of days or hours. For retailers that cannot implement instant refunds, automated “Where Is My Return?” (WISMR) communications are critical for keeping customers happy and reducing retailers’ overhead costs.\\nIn WISMR communications, the best practice is to notify customers by text or email when their return is received by the carrier, and either when it reaches the warehouse or when their refund is issued. Some retailers choose to do all three. \\nAn added benefit of multiple WISMR communications is it presents more opportunities to suggest products to the customer, or offer limited-time discounts to encourage another purchase.\\nOffer more choices\\nDigital returns and boxless returns are cheaper, more efficient alternatives to the old-school practice of enclosing a pre-printed return label with each order. Aside from wasting money and being bad for the environment, this old-school approach leaves you with zero visibility into what’s coming back and why. \\n(Did you know that by ditching pre-printed returns slips, retailers can save as much as ¢ 0.40 per order?—It may not seem like a lot, but that can quickly add up to thousands of dollars every year.)\\nAmazon popularized the boxless digital return, giving customers the option to go to a store and present a QR code when dropping off an item to be returned. Shopify retailers using the Narvar Returns & Exchanges App can choose to offer their customers an equally-convenient experience with more than 200,000 return drop-off locations between carrier stores and partner locations such as Walgreens, FedEx Office, Simon Malls, Mall of America and Nordstrom. \\nUtilize logistics to reduce shipping costs\\nMany retailers are no longer bound by a one-warehouse-services-all approach to inventory management, which means they can customize their reverse logistics policies to minimize losses. Policies can be tailored to account for shipping costs, warehouse space, categories of goods, and third party drop-shipments. \\nLet’s illustrate that idea with an example.\\nA customer in Florida orders a pair of shoes from a Shopify partner that has stores in New York and California. The California location has the size the customer wants, so the shoes are shipped cross-country from California to Florida. If the customer returns the shoes, the order doesn’t necessarily have to go back to California. If the retailer has space in their East Coast store to receive the return, it could be cheaper and faster to direct the return to New York.\\nThe best reverse-logistics rules aren’t fixed on a single data point, but fluid to account for a retailer’s day-to-day needs. Even if your ecommerce system doesn’t offer this option natively, you may be able to add it through third-party technology. \\nAnalyze and act on return feedback \\nEvery return tells a story. With customizable “reason for return,” retailers can gather feedback about their:\\nMaterials\\nManufacturing\\nShipping process\\nProduct photography\\nProduct description pages\\nNumber of returns in transit\\nCash value of returns received\\nAnd much more.\\n‍\\nExample of Narvar Returns & Exchanges dashboard for processing returns on Shopify\\n‍\\nShopify retailers can act on some of this information in real-time to improve their business. For example, if an unusually large number of customers are returning a dress because the size is wrong, the retailer can instantly adjust their product detail page to mitigate future returns. \\nIn sum…\\nCustomers love patronizing smaller ecommerce retailers, but they also value complete convenience in their online shopping experience. Thanks to app makers like Narvar, it’s becoming faster and easier for smaller Shopify sellers to reach, impress, and retain online shoppers. \\n‍\\nNarvar Team\\n‍\\nShare this Story\\nRelated Categories\\nReturns, Retail Technology\\nMost Recent\\nBoost Upsell Revenue: Smart Product Recommendations for Retailers\\nE-commerce CRO: 4 Easy Conversion Rate Optimization Tips\\nThe Power of Retailer Subscription Programs\\nWhat is Retail Return Fraud?

Hopefully you feel geared up and ready to face the day head on.\\nWhat about Cyber Monday, though? As much as people tend to simply lump Black Friday’s younger, online-only cousin in as just another day in the post-Thanksgiving shopping weekend, Cyber Monday is very much its own unique event with its own set of challenges, and solutions.\\n  Cyber Monday vs. Black Friday: How do They Stack Up?\\nNo matter what angle you look at it from, the truth of the matter is that Cyber Monday simply isn’t as big as Black Friday. A 2020 study from Statista found that while 41% of Canadians planned to shop on Black Friday, only 34% planned to shop on Cyber Monday[1].\\nIt isn’t necessarily a surprising statistic. With the rise of eCommerce in recent years, Black Friday has migrated more and more into the online space, to the point where over half of Black Friday shoppers in Canada planned to shop online last year[2].\\nThe result? The line between Black Friday and Cyber Monday is muddied. Does that mean that planning for Cyber Monday specifically is a waste of time?\\n    Why Focus on Cyber Monday?                                  \\nWith all these statistics making it seem like Cyber Monday is really just an extension of Black Friday, it would seem like there isn’t much point in putting focus into Cyber Monday as its own event. However, Cyber Monday is still a day with its own brand recognition.\\nIn the above-mentioned Statista study, there was also a 2% year-over-year increase in Cyber Monday shoppers over Black Friday shoppers. So, while eCommerce has become a major aspect of Black Friday, it is the very core of Cyber Monday, and customers have come to expect businesses to be ready for both.\\n    Getting Your Business Cyber Monday Ready\\nNaturally, being ready for Cyber Monday comes down to having a solid eCommerce model. Here are a few tips that you may want to consider for not only helping prepare your business for Cyber Monday, but to optimize your business’ online presence year-round!\\n  Integrate Shipping into Your Online Store\\n2020 saw a massive jump in eCommerce sales in Canada, with projections showing sales reaching over $32 billion USD in 2021.[4] The fact of the matter is that businesses need to be prepared for this shift to an eCommerce-centric model.\\nWith that in mind, one cannot understate the importance of integrating your shipping directly into your online store. Offering real-time shipping rates at checkout will not only improve the user experience for your online customers but will help you factor shipping fees into your own Cyber Monday strategy.\\n    Offer Multiple Shipping Options\\nDespite being a part of the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season, there are multiple reasons why people shop on Cyber Monday. Why not offer a variety of shipping options to cater to those needs?\\nWhile offering free or discounted shipping is a great marketing tool, some customers may be willing to pay a premium so that their items arrive quicker. In offering multiple shipping options, you can cater to a broader customer base.\\n  Have a Solid Return Policy\\nReturns are an unwanted but often unavoidable part of doing business. A watertight return policy, however, can not only drive your sales during Cyber Monday, but can help to solidify a customer base in the future.\\nOffering free shipping on returns acts as a show of good faith and can have a tremendous return on investment in the form of customer retention. In fact, studies have shown that upwards of 90% of customers would shop again with a retailer that offers easy returns.[5]\\n    Make Your Cyber Monday a Success with ClickShip\\nWith the right strategy and the right tools, you can turn Cyber Monday into a great opportunity for your business.\\nClickShip is here to help you with that!

It’s time to get smart about your options! Dig into different carriers and compare their speeds and prices – you might be surprised at what you find.\\nRESEARCH VARIOUS CARRIERS\\nPicking the right carrier can make or break your shipping game. Let’s dive into how to research carriers and find your perfect match.\\nCompare rates: Use multi-carrier calculators to check prices across USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DHL. USPS leads with 54% market share, followed by UPS at 47.7%, and FedEx at 37.3%. 2\\nSpeed matters: Look at delivery times for each service level. Some offer same-day delivery, while others might take a few days.\\nTrack record: Check carrier reliability. A reputable carrier like Couriers Atlanta might have better on-time delivery stats than others.\\nSpecial services: See if carriers offer extras like Saturday delivery or signature confirmation. These can be game-changers for your biz.\\nTech tools: Look for carriers with user-friendly websites and shipping software. Good tech can save you tons of time and headaches. 1\\nCoverage areas: Make sure your chosen carrier reaches all your customers. DHL, with 5.7% U.S. market share, might be great for international shipping.\\nHidden fees: Watch out for surcharges on fuel, residential delivery, or oversized packages. These can add up fast!\\nCustomer service: Test each carrier’s support. You’ll want help when things go wrong… and they will, trust me.\\nPackaging options: Some carriers offer free boxes or flat-rate options. This can be a huge money-saver for small businesses.\\nPickup services: Check if carriers will grab packages from your location. This can be a real time-saver, especially as you grow.\\nCOMPARE SERVICE SPEEDS AND PRICES\\nAfter scoping out carriers, it’s time to dive into the nitty-gritty. Let’s break down service speeds and prices – the real meat and potatoes of shipping decisions. 4\\nCarrier Service Speed Price Range Notes\\nUSPS First Class Mail 1-3 business days $ Best for packages under 16 oz\\nUSPS Priority Mail 1-3 business days $$ Up to $50 insurance included\\nUSPS Priority Mail Express Overnight to 2 days $$$ Up to $100 insurance included\\nUPS Ground 1-5 business days $$ Flat rate boxes up to 70 lbs\\nFedEx Ground 1-5 business days $$ One Rate boxes up to 50 lbs\\nPro tip: Mix and match services based on package weight and delivery urgency. USPS First Class Mail is a steal for light packages, while flat rate options from UPS or FedEx can be gold for heavier items. 3 Keep your shipping costs to 15-20% of total revenue to stay in the green. Happy shipping, geeks!\\nDEVELOPING EFFECTIVE SHIPPING STRATEGIES\\nCrafting a killer shipping strategy isn’t rocket science… but it’s close! It’s all about finding that sweet spot between keeping costs low and customers happy. Smart packaging choices can make a world of difference – think outside the box (pun intended) to slash those pesky shipping fees.\\nDESIGN A COMPREHENSIVE SHIPPING STRATEGY\\nCrafting a shipping strategy is tricky, but doable! You’ll need to balance costs, speed, and customer expectations like a pro. Start by checking your current shipping process. Look for slowdowns and money-wasters.\\nThen, do the math. Compare carriers, service levels, and packaging choices. Keep an eye on those yearly price bumps – USPS, UPS, and FedEx are raising rates by 5.9% in 2024. 5\\nNow, think about your customers. They hate surprise costs – 75.7% abandon their carts because of hidden shipping fees. Be clear about charges. Maybe offer free shipping with a catch.\\nSet a minimum order value about 30% above your average order. This can boost sales and keep shipping profitable. Keep in mind, 36% of shoppers leave if shipping costs too much. It’s all about balance! 2\\nA good shipping strategy is like a well-oiled machine – it keeps your business running smoothly and efficiently.\\nOPTIMIZE PACKAGING FOR COST REDUCTION\\nNow that you’ve got a solid shipping strategy, let’s talk about cutting costs on packaging. Smart packaging can save you big bucks! Did you know that in the U.S., $1 billion worth of goods get damaged during shipping each year? Yikes! But don’t worry, we’ve got some tricks up our sleeve.\\nFirst off, size matters. Using the right box size can slash your shipping costs. Think about it – why pay for air? UPS and FedEx use a formula (LxWxH / 139) to figure out dimensional weight.\\nUSPS uses a slightly different one (LxWxH / 166). So, pick boxes that snugly fit your products. 6 Also, try lightweight packing materials. Bubble wrap and airbags are your friends here.\\nThey’re light but still keep your stuff safe. And hey, your customers will thank you for not having to dig through a mountain of peanuts to find their order! 7\\nUTILIZING TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE EFFICIENCY\\nTech can be a game-changer for your shipping game. Smart software and automation tools can slash your workload and boost accuracy – it’s like having a digital assistant on steroids!\\nAUTOMATE SHIPPING PROCESSES\\nShipping automation is a game-changer for small businesses. It’s like having a robot assistant who never sleeps! With tools like ShipStation, you can zap away tedious tasks. No more manual order entry or label printing – these systems do it all.\\nThey sync with your online store, grab order details, and spit out shipping labels faster than you can say “package delivered.” 8\\nBut wait, there’s more! IoT devices are joining the party. These smart gadgets track your inventory and shipments in real-time. They’re like tiny spies… but for good! They help you optimize routes and cut down on errors. 9 Plus, automated picking and packing machines boost speed and accuracy. It’s like giving your shipping process a turbo boost. ShipStation users even saw a 16% jump in average order value with their Branded Returns Portal.\\nNow that’s what I call a shipping success story!\\nIMPLEMENT SHIPPING SOFTWARE FOR MANAGEMENT\\nShipping software is a game-changer for small biz owners. It’s like having a digital shipping guru at your fingertips! This nifty tech helps you track inventory in real-time, monitor shipments, and even crunch numbers to spot areas where you can save some cash. 10 Plus, it’s a breeze to use – no tech wizardry required.\\nGood software is like a good friend – it’s there when you need it and makes your life easier.\\nI’ve used these tools myself, and let me tell you, they’re worth their weight in gold. They slash shipping costs, boost profits, and make customers happier. 11 Ship.com, for example, offers sweet deals on shipping rates and free home pickup.\\nThat’s a win-win in my book!\\nSELECTING THE APPROPRIATE SHIPPING CARRIER\\nPicking the right shipping carrier can make or break your small biz. It’s not just about cost – speed, reliability, and customer service matter too. FedEx, UPS, and USPS each have their pros…\\nso do your homework before committing!\\nEVALUATE FACTORS LIKE RELIABILITY, COST, SPEED\\nPicking the right shipping carrier can make or break your small business. Let’s dive into the key factors you should weigh when choosing your shipping partner.\\nReliability: Your packages need to arrive on time, every time. Check carrier track records for on-time deliveries and lost package rates. Ask fellow geeks or browse online forums for real-world experiences. 12\\nCost: Shipping fees can eat into profits fast. Compare base rates, surcharges, and volume discounts. Don’t forget to factor in packaging costs too. Some carriers offer free boxes, which can save you a bundle. 11\\nSpeed: In our instant-gratification world, customers want their stuff yesterday. Look at delivery times for different service levels. Some carriers excel at overnight shipping, while others shine with ground service.\\nCoverage area: Make sure your chosen carrier can reach all your customers. This is extra important if you ship internationally or to remote areas.\\nTracking capabilities: Your tech-savvy customers will want real-time package tracking. Check out each carrier’s tracking tools and APIs for integration with your systems.\\nInsurance options: Accidents happen. Compare insurance costs and claim processes. Some carriers include basic coverage, while others charge extra.\\nPickup services: If you ship a lot, having packages picked up can save time and hassle. See which carriers offer free pickup and how often.\\nTechnology integration: Look for carriers with robust APIs and plugins for your e-commerce platform. This can streamline your shipping process and reduce errors.\\nCustomer service: When things go wrong, you need help fast. Test out each carrier’s customer support channels and response times.\\nSpecial handling: If you ship fragile items or hazardous materials, make sure your carrier can handle them safely and legally.\\nREVIEW MAJOR CARRIERS: USPS, FEDEX, DHL\\nLet’s check out the big three shipping carriers. Each has its own strengths and quirks. Here’s a quick rundown to help you pick the best fit for your small biz: 13\\nCarrier Pros Cons Best For\\nUSPS – Cheapest for packages under 1 lb\\n– Free pickup\\n– Saturday delivery at no extra cost – Less reliable tracking\\n– Slower for larger packages Small, light items; budget-conscious shippers\\nFedEx – Fast delivery times\\n– Excellent tracking\\n– Good for bulky items – More expensive\\n– Surcharges for residential delivery Time-sensitive shipments; B2B deliveries\\nDHL – Global reach\\n– Competitive international rates\\n– Customs expertise – Limited domestic service in US\\n– Can be pricey for small shipments International shipping; e-commerce businesses 14\\nPro tip: Mix and match these carriers.

With the right know-how, you’ll be zipping packages worldwide like a pro in no time.\\nLEARN ABOUT CUSTOMS REGULATIONS AND FEES\\nCustoms rules can be tricky. Each country has its own set of laws for goods coming in. You’ll need to know these rules to avoid delays or fines. Fees can also add up fast. There’s import duty, value-added tax, and sometimes extra charges.\\nIt’s smart to check with the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the latest info. 1\\nDon’t forget about paperwork! You’ll need the right forms filled out correctly. This might include a commercial invoice, packing list, and certificate of origin. Getting these wrong can hold up your shipment big time.\\nPro tip: some countries have special rules for certain items. Do your homework before you ship anything unusual or valuable. 16\\nSELECT CARRIERS WITH ROBUST INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS\\nPicking the right carrier for global shipping can make or break your business. DHL Express is great for small shops getting into international trade. They have a massive network across the globe, which means quicker deliveries and fewer issues along the way.\\nTheir technology is excellent, too, so you can track packages easily. 2\\nBut it’s smart to work with multiple carriers. This approach speeds up delivery times and reduces risks. You’ll also have more leverage when negotiating prices. Here’s a tip: Build relationships with carrier account managers.\\nThey might offer you great discounts and benefits you weren’t aware of. 17\\nFOCUSING ON PACKAGING AND BRANDING\\nYour packaging speaks volumes about your brand. It’s your chance to wow customers and leave a lasting impression – so don’t skimp on it! Think outside the box (pun intended) and get creative with your packaging design.\\nBRAND PACKAGING FOR IMPROVED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES\\nGeeks, listen up! Brand packaging isn’t just a box.

Free marketing, anyone? 19 Next up, let’s talk about making returns a breeze.\\nENSURE PACKAGING SAFETY TO REDUCE DAMAGES\\nMoving from brand packaging to safety, let’s talk about protecting your goods. Safe packaging is key to happy customers and fewer losses. Did you know? Each year, U.S. businesses lose $1 billion due to shipping damage.\\nYikes! That’s a lot of cash down the drain. 7\\nSo, how do we fix this? First, cut down on empty space in boxes. It’s not just about saving on packing materials. Less wiggle room means less chance for items to bounce around and break. 20 Next, train your team on proper packing techniques. It’s like teaching a secret handshake – but way more useful. With these tricks up your sleeve, you’ll see fewer broken items and more smiling faces when packages arrive.\\nSTREAMLINING RETURNS AND REFUNDS\\nReturns can be a real headache for small businesses. But with a smart plan, you can turn them into a chance to wow your customers and keep ’em coming back.\\nESTABLISH A CLEAR RETURN POLICY\\nA clear return policy is a must for your gaming business. It builds trust and keeps customers coming back. Put it front and center on your website – don’t hide it! 21 A 30-day window is common and gives folks time to check out their purchases.\\nSome shops even offer free returns, which can really boost loyalty.\\nMake your policy easy to understand. No complicated terms or legal jargon. Just spell out what can be returned, how to do it, and any costs involved. 22 This clarity helps avoid confusion and keeps both you and your customers happy.\\nA good return policy isn’t just about rules – it’s about showing you care about your customers’ satisfaction.\\nSIMPLIFY THE CUSTOMER RETURN PROCESS\\nReturns can make or break a small business. Let’s dive into ways to simplify the process and keep your geek customers happy.\\nClear policy: Spell out your return rules in plain English. No legalese or fine print. 24\\nEasy-to-find info: Put return details on your site’s main menu and product pages.\\nPrepaid labels: Include return labels in packages. It’s a small cost that pays off big. 23\\nExtended windows: Give customers 30-60 days to return items. More time equals less stress.\\nFree returns: If possible, offer free return shipping.

Track your data and listen to what customers say. It’ll help you stay on top of your game and save some serious cash.\\nTRACK AND ANALYZE SHIPPING DATA\\nShipping data is a goldmine for smart business owners. By keeping an eye on your shipments, you can spot trends and save big bucks. Got a bunch of packages going to the same zip code? You might snag a sweet discount by bundling them together.\\nOr maybe you’ll notice that certain products always arrive late – time to switch carriers! It’s like being a detective, but instead of solving crimes, you’re figuring out efficient shipping. 25\\nNumbers don’t lie, and neither does your shipping data. Use tools like Google Analytics to track your packages from start to finish. You’ll see which routes are fastest, which carriers are most reliable, and where your costs are increasing.\\nWith this info, you can make smart choices that’ll keep your customers happy and your wallet full. In e-commerce, knowledge is power – and shipping data is your secret weapon. 26\\nMODIFY STRATEGIES BASED ON CUSTOMER FEEDBACK AND COST ADJUSTMENTS\\nAfter crunching the numbers, it’s time to fine-tune your game plan. Smart geeks know that shipping isn’t set-and-forget. You gotta keep your ear to the ground and your eyes on the prize.\\nListen to what your customers are saying – they’re the real MVPs here. Are they griping about slow delivery? Time to kick things up a notch. Maybe they’re raving about your eco-friendly packaging? Double down on that green goodness.\\nBut don’t just stop at customer chatter. Keep tabs on those pesky costs too. Carriers love to shake things up with new fees or rate hikes. Stay sharp and pivot when needed. If FedEx is bleeding you dry, maybe it’s time to give USPS a shot.\\nOr hey, why not mix it up with a regional carrier for those nearby deliveries?

Showcasing UGC\\nthroughout the buyer journey can increase the effectiveness of marketing efforts. Savvy\\nbrands are including highlights from five-star reviews in emails and social media. They\\neven feature customer photos in ads. UGC can make a critical impact on search as well. If\\na brand publishes enough reviews on their eCommerce site and uses an approved Google\\npartner (reviews provider), star ratings have a high likelihood of being published in\\norganic search for a brand. A new feature released by Google will also display customer\\nphotos with Google Shopping Ads, in addition to ratings and reviews.\\n\\nIn Yotpo’s State of D2C Marketing Report for 2019, it was found that reviews are the\\nmost deployed feature on eCommerce websites, with 3 out of 4 D2C brands having\\nimplemented them to date. In the future, 9 out of 10 brands will offer reviews. Today,\\n1 out of 3 brands say they feature customer photos, increasing to 2 out of 3 brands in the\\nnear future. Videos are heating up. While only 15% currently feature customer videos,\\nmore than a third plan to invest in them as the next frontier of visual marketing for\\neCommerce.\\n\\n© 2020 ShoppingGives All Rights Reserved                                                     9\\nThe eCommerce Technology Playbook - Customer Journey Essentials\\n\\nLeverage Reviews and UGC to create a Referral\\nProgram\\nBecause reviews and UGC are so influential with shoppers, they also\\nprovide valuable fuel for a brand’s referral and loyalty programs. And the proof is in the\\nROI.

Maximize ROI\\nMaximizing e-commerce profits is often talked about in terms of increasing prices or decreasing expenses.But while initiatives like these are important, there’s another opportunity for merchants to maximize their return on investment (ROI) that’s often overlooked:\\n‍Improving the profitability of a shop’s return process.Roughly 25% of consumers return as much as 15% of their online orders—and each return comes with costs that negatively impact your business.To maximize your ecommerce ROI, you need to follow these three rules to ensure expenses related to returns aren’t hurting your profitability.Rule #1: Reduce shipping costs when restocking inventory \\nIf your return policy allows customers to send items back in exchange for a refund or store credit, you may have some flexibility regarding where your returns are sent.Imagine that your business stores merchandise in warehouses located in New York and California.If a customer in Oregon purchases an item that’s in stock at your New York location, you’ll have no choice but to ship it cross-country from there.But if they initiate a return of the item, having it delivered to your California warehouse (rather than New York origin) could help you reduce return shipping fees.A few other considerations you’ll want to keep in mind when it comes to reducing shipping costs on restocked inventory include:\\nWhether your ecommerce shopping cart system gives you the flexibility to assign return destinations by product category, by the item’s size and weight, or by individual product SKUs.If your e-commerce solution doesn’t offer this ability natively, you may need to investigate whether integrating with a third-party technology provider makes sense.The average distance between your locations and your customers\\nIf you have several warehouse locations around the country, reducing shipping costs in this way is more viable than if you only have a single location.The sophistication of your reverse logistics network\\nIf you plan to send returns to warehouses, distribution centers (DCs), or other physical locations, do these facilities have the capabilities required to process returns and restock inventory that didn’t originate from the location?If you partner with drop-shippers…Evaluate whether setting return locations based on product SKUs so that you don’t have to involve your drop-shipping partners in the return process may make sense.One more thing…‍\\nKeep in mind that streamlining your returns process by utilizing multiple locations may also help to get your returned stock back on the shelves as quickly as possible.In turn, this may increase your odds of being able to resell merchandise at full value, rather than having to discount items that are no longer in peak demand.Rule #2: Set longer return windows for VIP customers \\nGenerally speaking, shorter return windows come with financial benefits.Not only are you more likely to be able to resell returned items at full price, but reconverting resold items into revenue more quickly limits the impact of outstanding returns on your working capital and keeps your financial records more accurate.That said, longer return periods are in your customers’ best interest.Consumers don’t want to be rushed, and global shipping delays associated mean they may not be comfortable taking a chance on a retailer with a shorter return window.Fortunately, there is a middle ground: setting a longer return window for your best customers only.Although companies like Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, and DSW already offer tiered VIP return benefits, Narvar’s 2021 Return Policy Benchmark Report found that only 9% of retailers across Fortune 50 retailers, omnichannel merchants, and direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands offer them.By offering longer return windows to your top customers based on lifetime spend or loyalty program enrollment, you encourage future orders while also reducing costs through shorter windows applied to the bulk of your buyers.Rule #3: Charge a conditional restocking fee \\nOne final rule to consider implementing is a conditional restocking fee that allows you to assess additional charges in certain cases.For example, you might charge conditional restocking fees:\\nWhen customers are returning items that are above a certain weight or size, for which you’ll incur exceptionally high return shipping fees.When international customers need to return items to your domestic facilities.To shoppers who aren’t enrolled in your loyalty program (or in a specific loyalty program tier that offers free shipping perks).As a retailer, you have a lot of discretion here.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"pCTGsj0fLjSWpTKASGlyz4IHRXlhT53mdB3FyfBSP78=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"611f8c66-4492-4c22-8b61-793d3af0dfe9":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"611f8c66-4492-4c22-8b61-793d3af0dfe9\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://corp.narvar.com/blog/returns-shopify-maximize-roi\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ce5f07bf-7a36-4807-bae5-455cae0b83a1\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://corp.narvar.com/blog/returns-shopify-maximize-roi\"},\"hash\":\"vufFTU149in13IDbGudbgw2RblcT/t2v12VEoKVubW0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"25ca3554-9ef9-4b3a-9978-5e5971295756\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://corp.narvar.com/blog/returns-shopify-maximize-roi\"},\"hash\":\"pCTGsj0fLjSWpTKASGlyz4IHRXlhT53mdB3FyfBSP78=\"}},\"text\":\"By

restocking fees may be helpful.Just be sure that any policies you implement are clearly defined in key areas of your site to prevent confusion or frustration among customers.Finally, be cautious when implementing return policies that have the potential to disrupt your customers’ experience during the reverse logistics process—96% of customers who rate their return experience positively say they’ll shop with that retailer again.Be sure any approach you take to maximize ROI through your return rules balances both financial benefits and the benefits of creating a positive returns experience.Narvar

Furniture Retail\\nMost furniture is big, heavy, and almost impossible to fit in anything that resembles standard packaging.All of which is to say offering “free shipping” or “ free returns” seems like a questionable idea for furniture retailers looking to stay profitable.However, failing to offer shoppers at least one of these freebies is risky—it could mean missing out on sales to your competitors.So, what’s a furniture retailer like you to do?Well, you need to start by taking a serious look at what “free” means for your future growth, because it could be the best investment you ever make.The case for free returns in furniture retail\\nFurniture shoppers want a smooth, seamless returns process, and that almost always means “free” too.The downside for furniture retailers like you is that the return costs for your products are high, with packaging playing a significant role (more on that later).The key, then, is to think about the return on investment for offering free returns instead of dwelling on the upfront costs.Do free returns lead to more repeat sales and growing customer lifetime value?Does offering free returns allow your customer service team to focus on other crucial areas of the business?Do free returns lead to more positive reviews and customer referrals, both of which contribute to higher net-new sales?How you answer those questions will determine whether offering free returns makes sense.As you weigh your answers, consider these numbers…According to a roundup of studies on returns:\\nFree return shipping can increase long-term profits by 25%\\n80% of shoppers say return policies impact either current or future sales\\n66% of shoppers read returns policies ahead of a purchase\\nHassle-free returns can boost repeat shoppers by up to 75%\\n55% of shoppers view restocking fees as a reason not to buy from you\\nWhen free shipping makes sense in furniture retail\\nFree shipping is an offer every business owner knows because it works—88% of shoppers will always choose an option with free shipping.In other words, offering people free shipping is correlated with increased order volumes, higher average order values, and a general boost to conversion.For furniture retailers, the real question with free shipping is: “At what level does this make sense?”Put another way, at what product price point do the costs of free shipping make financial sense to your business?This isn’t an easy question to answer.If free shipping facilitates a 5% increase in online sales, you need to figure out if that’s enough additional revenue is enough to offset the expense.Now, because the average order value is usually high in the furniture retail business, offering shoppers free shipping is doable.Especially if your company partners with a third-party logistics provider (3PL) to optimize flat-pack packaging based on DIM weight (and other factors) to drive down fulfillment costs.(Sound too good to be true?—Then look at your competitors.See how often they advertise free shipping.If their customers look like your customers (i.e., same shopper profile), it’s a good bet that your competitors are seeing growth in total order volume by sacrificing a small amount of per-sale margin.)A quick note on affordability\\nIf you’re a furniture seller (especially in the flat-pack world), affordability is always on your mind—what will a free return (or free shipping) offer cost, and when does a “free” offer transition from an asset to a liability?The fact is, shipping costs for furniture scale quickly.Trying to get a customer to disassemble their furniture safely, put it back in the original box (with all the padding and cushioning), and returning that box safely to your warehouse or store feels like an exercise in futility.Take that into account when you’re thinking about returns and affordability.A few other considerations you need to make…What’s the TOTAL cost of a return (including shipping, QA, testing, repackaging, restocking, etc.)?Can you strengthen padding and in-fill for returns protection (or use larger, sturdier packaging) for increased protection without increased costs, if you’re paying based on DIM weight?Can you increase the cost of your items to cover a free shipping or return offer?Have you asked customers what they prefer?Shipping or returns?And don’t forget to consider packaging in all of this.Anything you do to reduce shipping costs (e.g., slimming down packaging weight) must not prevent customers from reusing your packaging for the  return process.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"XjsvD3HOiFCWp+wEGAmHmmop2IiWuYShMw/AOEPxEV0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"548933ad-8dab-4896-8155-65cf1bcb460a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"548933ad-8dab-4896-8155-65cf1bcb460a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://corp.narvar.com/blog/free-shipping-furniture-retail\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"d25e2184-7e70-4d9e-9700-a2c9a090345b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://corp.narvar.com/blog/free-shipping-furniture-retail\"},\"hash\":\"7loY+iEUtz2CBq9JNsF34/mx/pVOSw4s5ng0079qZg0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"24a5dbd0-b98d-4e7f-a305-7e5785e13e57\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://corp.narvar.com/blog/free-shipping-furniture-retail\"},\"hash\":\"XjsvD3HOiFCWp+wEGAmHmmop2IiWuYShMw/AOEPxEV0=\"}},\"text\":\"Take

reliable estimates and better control costs by reducing the number of customer service requests you receive from people who need a new box or can’t play packaging Tetris as well as your warehouse staff.Do you need to choose “either-or”?Many online furniture retailers approach “free” offers as an either-or situation.They feel like they can afford either free returns or free shipping, but not both, because the costs are too difficult to absorb.Do not get sucked into this trap—challenge yourself to offer both free returns and free shipping as a way to jumpstart customer demand and fuel new sales.More often than not, seeing “Free shipping, free returns” is the straw that breaks the tentative shopper’s back, compelling them to finally click “buy.”And if you must pick one or the other?—Well, examine your ideal customer profile, think about which option they’d prefer, and move forward accordingly.Alex Selwitz\\nAlex Selwitz is the Director of SEO for Red Stag Fulfillment, an

Faster\\nLooking for ways to make 2023 your best year ever?—Start with returns.Specifically, start by embracing opportunities to make your returns process faster and more efficient.Anywhere from 13% to 20% of all retail purchases are returned.By encouraging faster returns, you'll expand available inventory for future purchases and you're more likely to recoup the cost of the item via resale.To help you get on your way, here are 5 ways to get returns back faster to your business.Incentivize customers to initiate returns faster \\nThe sooner merchandise is returned to inventory, the more likely it is to be sold at full price.Taking a tiered approach to your return policy is an excellent way to balance customer expectations with your own financial considerations.Consider offering certain VIP shoppers an extended return window, while encouraging less-valuable one-off buyers to get their returns back faster.For example, Saks Fifth Avenue offers free shipping on returns initiated within 14 days of the ship date.For returns outside that window, Saks deducts $9.95 from  customer’s refund to cover shipping on return.Another example?—Sephora.They only offer credit to customers on the original form of payment for returns received within 30 days of purchase.For those received between 31 and 60 days of purchase, they only offer store credit.Add convenience to the return process\\nCustomers want value, but they also want complete convenience.When it comes to returns, that means retailers need to offer methods that don’t involve re-boxing products, printing return labels, or waiting in line at the post office.Tap into a broad network of return locations as it's the natural next step beyond the traditional third-party carrier return process.While the majority of retail returns are made in-store or by mail, shoppers are willing to explore a wide-variety of return methods including curbside drop off, home pickup, and drop off at a third-party location.The more frequently shoppers utilize alternative return methods, the more they will come to expect them.In an age where convenience is expected, it’s critical that merchants provide a wider array of return choices such as home pickup, digital returns, standard courier return shipping, buy online, return in store (BORIS), and digital-to-physical returns through a partner network.Amazon's offered this service for years by leveraging a partnership with Kohl’s and by acquiring Whole Foods Market to utilize as a brick-and-mortar drop-off point for ecommerce returns.(Established in a similar vein, Narvar Concierge provides a network of more than 200,000 return drop-off locations for retailers, offering customers a way to make returns at Walgreens, Nordstrom, Simon Malls, Mall of America, and more.)Boxless returns and labelless returns are another alternative.Boxless returns through The UPS Store make it easy for consumers to return ecommerce purchases.The store associates scan a QR code from the customer’s smartphone and accept the return—no packaging or label printing required.Similarly, home pickup allows customers schedule a courier to retrieve a return from their doorstep, resulting in 30% faster return times and sky-high net promoter scores.Optimize routing for fast processing \\nWhere should returned merchandise go—to a brick and mortar store or back to a distribution center?Selecting a destination for returns should be a proactive business calculation for retailers.Some retailers prefer to reduce shipping costs by accepting returns at their brick and mortar store locations; others rely on distribution centers for assessing damage and repackaging.There’s no one-size-fits all solution, but retailers can use an online return portal to encourage the behavior they want.For example, if an in-store return is preferred, you can charge a nominal return shipping fee to dissuade customers from mailing an item back.Or if you already offer free return shipping, persuade customers to elect curbside returns for faster refund timelines.Whichever approach you decide to take, just remember that communication is key—return policies and procedures should be explained clearly on your website, as well as in order confirmation and return merchandise authorization (RMA) emails.Set your team up for success\\nSmart processes save retailers time and money.On

no one-size-fits all solution, but retailers can use an online return portal to encourage the behavior they want.For example, if an in-store return is preferred, you can charge a nominal return shipping fee to dissuade customers from mailing an item back.Or if you already offer free return shipping, persuade customers to elect curbside returns for faster refund timelines.Whichever approach you decide to take, just remember that communication is key—return policies and procedures should be explained clearly on your website, as well as in order confirmation and return merchandise authorization (RMA) emails.Set your team up for success\\nSmart processes save retailers time and money.On the customer service side, investing in an automated, branded returns portal streamlines the process for customers, and gives representatives bandwidth to deal with more complex issues like lost packages and quality control.For the customer, an automated return process creates an instant gratification, letting them handle the return on their own schedule.Customers who have to wait hours or days for an RMA to trickle through a service queue are less likely to be happy with the experience.On the fulfillment side, make sure your warehouse team knows how to process returns quickly into your inventory management software (IMS).Quick processing is important for two reasons.Adding merchandise back into the flow of commerce with speed increases the odds for resale.Customers want their money back, so processing refunds as soon as possible increases your customer satisfaction rating.Use past return data to inform decisions and prevent future returns \\nMost retailers ask customers to choose a reason for their return when initiating a return online.That data is useful in identifying trends, updating product descriptions, and making future inventory decisions.Therefore, make sure you audit and update your “reason for return” options at least once a year.According to Narvar’s 2022 State of Returns Report, the most common reason for returns is fit—a reason generally accounted for in a returns menu, along with color, quality, and changed mind.Consumers are getting bigger, with adult obesity increasing from 27% to 32% between 2011 and 2020.When people shop, they aren’t always conscious of changes to their body —especially with the surge in online shopping over the last two years.While you can’t control the physical changes of your customers, you can help them make the right size choice by enhancing your product detail pages through the inclusion of augmented reality, sharper photography (featuring multiple models), customer reviews, product FAQ, and more.Of course, “doesn’t fit” is an overly broad term that doesn’t explain if the item was too big or too small, so flesh out the reason options in a way that can inform product descriptions and business decisions.A fashion retailer, for example, might include the following options in their reasons for return:\\nToo small\\nToo big\\nDidn’t like material/quality\\nColor looked different in person\\nChanged mind\\nBetter price available elsewhere\\nPurchase multiple items to compare\\nOther\\nWith that information, a retailer can identify quality control issues that warrant changes in manufacturing partners or whether the product description (and photography) is inaccurate.Including the option of “purchased multiple items,” retailers can determine how many customers are bracketing.And, by allowing customers to select more than one reason—instead of only the \\\"main\\\" reason—retailers can gather more data points to shape future decisions.In sum...Customers want a generous return policy, hassle-free shipping options, and quick refunds.Retailers want to build customer loyalty, increase revenue, and minimize the need for returns.Make this the year that you and your brand commit to overhauling your return process so that you can keep customers happy and get returns back faster.Narvar Team\\n‍\\nShare this Story\\nRelated Categories\\nReturns, Supply Chain\\nMost Recent\\nBoost Upsell Revenue: Smart Product Recommendations

Shopify\\nBefore we can discuss best practices for processing returns on Shopify, consider these numbers:\\n89% percent of shoppers made a return in the last three years\\n41% of shoppers regularly bracket\\nBetween 20% and 30% of online purchases are returned each year\\n95% of customers who are satisfied with a retailer’s returns process will purchase from that retailer again\\nNumbers like that are why it’s so important for Shopify retailers to balance customer-friendly policies with the real-life costs of processing returns.Here are seven best practices for processing returns on Shopify.Adopt a simple return policy \\nA great Shopify return policy is explainable in a few sentences, and features key details such as the number of days a customer has to start a return and how refunds are issued.Policies that offer 30-days to initiate a return and receive a full-refund are something of the ecommerce standard.Beyond time limits, a simple return policy should stick to other core details such as:\\nHow an item may be returned\\nWhat way the customer will be credited \\nInstructions on how to start the return process\\nConvert returns to exchanges or store credit\\nReturns don’t need to equate to refunds—exchanges and store credit are fantastic alternatives.Lululemon, for example, offers a Fast Track refund option, allowing shoppers returning three or fewer new items to receive a refund via e-gift card within two hours of dropping their items off at a FedEx or USPS location (rather than waiting days or weeks for the return to be received, processed, and approved at the warehouse).Shopify can utilize the Narvar Returns & Exchanges app to turn up to 60% of returns into exchanges.After entering their order information and reason for return, the customer can exchange their purchase for a different item or size, giving the retailer a better chance of retaining revenue.Automate the return flow\\nEcommerce thrives on the thrill of immediacy.If you don’t make the customer wait hours for a purchase confirmation, why would you make them wait hours for a return confirmation?Shopify retailers can use Narvar’s Shopify app to initiate a return, offer feedback for why they’re making the return, and receive instant confirmation and instructions for next steps.Shopify retailers can even automatically extend special return perks to VIP customers or decline returns from blacklisted customers.Get ahead of WISMR \\nOnce a return is underway, customers want a refund or exchange to be processed within 30 days.Thanks to instant refunds and credits, many ecommerce customers expect their money even faster—in a matter of days or hours.For retailers that cannot implement instant refunds, automated “Where Is My Return?”(WISMR) communications are critical for keeping customers happy and reducing retailers’ overhead costs.In WISMR communications, the best practice is to notify customers by text or email when their return is received by the carrier, and either when it reaches the warehouse or when their refund is issued.Some retailers choose to do all three.An added benefit of multiple WISMR communications is it presents more opportunities to suggest products to the customer, or offer limited-time discounts to encourage another purchase.Offer more choices\\nDigital returns and boxless returns are cheaper, more efficient alternatives to the old-school practice of enclosing a pre-printed return label with each order.Aside from wasting money and being bad for the environment, this old-school approach leaves you with zero visibility into what’s coming back and why.(Did you know that by ditching pre-printed returns slips, retailers can save as much as ¢ 0.40 per order?—It may not seem like a lot, but that can quickly add up to thousands of dollars every year.)Amazon popularized the boxless digital return, giving customers the option to go to a store and present a QR code when dropping off an item to be returned.Shopify retailers using the Narvar Returns & Exchanges App can choose to offer their customers an equally-convenient experience with more than 200,000 return drop-off locations between carrier stores and partner locations such as Walgreens, FedEx Office, Simon Malls, Mall of America and Nordstrom.Utilize logistics to reduce shipping costs\\nMany retailers are no longer bound by a one-warehouse-services-all approach to inventory management, which means they can customize their reverse logistics policies to minimize losses.Policies can be tailored to account for shipping costs, warehouse space, categories of goods, and third party drop-shipments.Let’s illustrate that idea with an example.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"MxLsikx0Shw+NTNOw5o/gjP4XZFf34DyFyC9xwl0Va4=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"439dee5f-ce11-409c-b6fc-0c6fc52c0b7c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"439dee5f-ce11-409c-b6fc-0c6fc52c0b7c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://corp.narvar.com/blog/processing-returns-on-shopify\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ee32fd2c-42e5-4454-aba9-11d1752d0a58\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://corp.narvar.com/blog/processing-returns-on-shopify\"},\"hash\":\"rEG3auc8sdur8vIg9hQizcqWApUVl1MgGE3N1yErXK0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"92684e97-0f13-4657-8a60-127974318ed1\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://corp.narvar.com/blog/processing-returns-on-shopify\"},\"hash\":\"MxLsikx0Shw+NTNOw5o/gjP4XZFf34DyFyC9xwl0Va4=\"}},\"text\":\"—It

tailored to account for shipping costs, warehouse space, categories of goods, and third party drop-shipments.Let’s illustrate that idea with an example.A customer in Florida orders a pair of shoes from a Shopify partner that has stores in New York and California.The California location has the size the customer wants, so the shoes are shipped cross-country from California to Florida.If the customer returns the shoes, the order doesn’t necessarily have to go back to California.If the retailer has space in their East Coast store to receive the return, it could be cheaper and faster to direct the return to New York.The best reverse-logistics rules aren’t fixed on a single data point, but fluid to account for a retailer’s day-to-day needs.Even if your ecommerce system doesn’t offer this option natively, you may be able to add it through third-party technology.Analyze and act on return feedback \\nEvery return tells a story.With customizable “reason for return,” retailers can gather feedback about their:\\nMaterials\\nManufacturing\\nShipping process\\nProduct photography\\nProduct description pages\\nNumber of returns in transit\\nCash value of returns received\\nAnd much more.‍\\nExample of Narvar Returns & Exchanges dashboard for processing returns on Shopify\\n‍\\nShopify retailers can act on some of this information in real-time to improve their business.For example, if an unusually large number of customers are returning a dress because the size is wrong, the retailer can instantly adjust their product detail page to mitigate future returns.In sum…Customers love patronizing smaller ecommerce retailers, but they also value complete convenience in their online shopping experience.Thanks to app makers like Narvar, it’s becoming faster and easier for smaller Shopify sellers to reach, impress, and retain online shoppers.‍\\nNarvar Team\\n‍\\nShare this Story\\nRelated Categories\\nReturns, Retail Technology\\nMost Recent\\nBoost Upsell

Monday 2021: Is Your Online Store Ready?Brandon Draga\\nNov 22, 2021 9:16:29 AM\\nShare this Post\\nThere is simply no denying the unexpected retail juggernaut that is Black Friday in Canada.Hopefully you feel geared up and ready to face the day head on.What about Cyber Monday, though?As much as people tend to simply lump Black Friday’s younger, online-only cousin in as just another day in the post-Thanksgiving shopping weekend, Cyber Monday is very much its own unique event with its own set of challenges, and solutions.Cyber Monday vs. Black Friday: How do They Stack Up?No matter what angle you look at it from, the truth of the matter is that Cyber Monday simply isn’t as big as Black Friday.A 2020 study from Statista found that while 41% of Canadians planned to shop on Black Friday, only 34% planned to shop on Cyber Monday[1].It isn’t necessarily a surprising statistic.With the rise of eCommerce in recent years, Black Friday has migrated more and more into the online space, to the point where over half of Black Friday shoppers in Canada planned to shop online last year[2].The result?The line between Black Friday and Cyber Monday is muddied.Does that mean that planning for Cyber Monday specifically is a waste of time?Why Focus on Cyber Monday?With all these statistics making it seem like Cyber Monday is really just an extension of Black Friday, it would seem like there isn’t much point in putting focus into Cyber Monday as its own event.However, Cyber Monday is still a day with its own brand recognition.In the above-mentioned Statista study, there was also a 2% year-over-year increase in Cyber Monday shoppers over Black Friday shoppers.So, while eCommerce has become a major aspect of Black Friday, it is the very core of Cyber Monday, and customers have come to expect businesses to be ready for both.Getting Your Business Cyber Monday Ready\\nNaturally, being ready for Cyber Monday comes down to having a solid eCommerce model.Here are a few tips that you may want to consider for not only helping prepare your business for Cyber Monday, but to optimize your business’ online presence year-round!Integrate Shipping into Your Online Store\\n2020 saw a massive jump in eCommerce sales in Canada, with projections showing sales reaching over $32 billion USD in 2021.[4] The fact of the matter is that businesses need to be prepared for this shift to an eCommerce-centric model.With that in mind, one cannot understate the importance of integrating your shipping directly into your online store.Offering real-time shipping rates at checkout will not only improve the user experience for your online customers but will help you factor shipping fees into your own Cyber Monday strategy.Offer Multiple Shipping Options\\nDespite being a part of the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season, there are multiple reasons why people shop on Cyber Monday.Why not offer a variety of shipping options to cater to those needs?While offering free or discounted shipping is a great marketing tool, some customers may be willing to pay a premium so that their items arrive quicker.In offering multiple shipping options, you can cater to a broader customer base.Have a Solid Return Policy\\nReturns are an unwanted but often unavoidable part of doing business.A watertight return policy, however, can not only drive your sales during Cyber Monday, but can help to solidify a customer base in the future.Offering free shipping on returns acts as a show of good faith and can have a tremendous return on investment in the form of customer retention.In fact, studies have shown that upwards of 90% of customers would shop again with a retailer that offers easy returns.[5]\\n    Make Your Cyber Monday a Success with

expenses.1 But don’t fret!We’ve got your back with 10 genius hacks to slash those costs.These tips will transform your shipping game.3 Ready to save big?KEY TAKEAWAYS\\nSmall businesses can lose up to 25% of revenue to shipping costs, but smart strategies can slash expenses.Comparing carriers like USPS (54% market share), UPS (47.7%), and FedEx (37.3%) helps find the best rates and services for your needs.Optimizing packaging size and materials can prevent damage and reduce dimensional weight charges from carriers.Shipping software and automation tools boost efficiency, with some users seeing a 16% increase in average order value.Offering free shipping on orders 30% above your average sale value can increase conversions, as 85% of customers prioritize free shipping.TABLE OF CONTENTS\\nEXPLORING SHIPPING COSTS AND OPTIONS\\nShipping costs can make or break your small biz.It’s time to get smart about your options!Dig into different carriers and compare their speeds and prices – you might be surprised at what you find.RESEARCH VARIOUS CARRIERS\\nPicking the right carrier can make or break your shipping game.Let’s dive into how to research carriers and find your perfect match.Compare rates: Use multi-carrier calculators to check prices across USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DHL.USPS leads with 54% market share, followed by UPS at 47.7%, and FedEx at 37.3%.2\\nSpeed matters: Look at delivery times for each service level.Some offer same-day delivery, while others might take a few days.Track record: Check carrier reliability.A reputable carrier like Couriers Atlanta might have better on-time delivery stats than others.Special services: See if carriers offer extras like Saturday delivery or signature confirmation.These can be game-changers for your biz.Tech tools: Look for carriers with user-friendly websites and shipping software.Good tech can save you tons of time and headaches.1\\nCoverage areas: Make sure your chosen carrier reaches all your customers.DHL, with 5.7% U.S.market share, might be great for international shipping.Hidden fees: Watch out for surcharges on fuel, residential delivery, or oversized packages.These can add up fast!Customer service: Test each carrier’s support.You’ll want help when things go wrong…and they will, trust me.Packaging options: Some carriers offer free boxes or flat-rate options.This can be a huge money-saver for small businesses.Pickup services: Check if carriers will grab packages from your location.This can be a real time-saver, especially as you grow.COMPARE SERVICE SPEEDS AND PRICES\\nAfter scoping out carriers, it’s time to dive into the nitty-gritty.Let’s break down service speeds and prices – the real meat and potatoes of shipping decisions.4\\nCarrier Service Speed Price Range Notes\\nUSPS First Class Mail 1-3 business days $ Best for packages under 16 oz\\nUSPS Priority Mail 1-3 business days $$ Up to $50 insurance included\\nUSPS Priority Mail Express Overnight to 2 days $$$ Up to $100 insurance included\\nUPS Ground 1-5 business days $$ Flat rate boxes up to 70 lbs\\nFedEx Ground 1-5 business days $$ One Rate boxes up to 50 lbs\\nPro tip: Mix and match services based on package weight and delivery urgency.USPS First Class Mail is a steal for light packages, while flat rate options from UPS or FedEx can be gold for heavier items.3 Keep your shipping costs to 15-20% of total revenue to stay in the green.Happy shipping, geeks!DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE SHIPPING STRATEGIES\\nCrafting a killer shipping strategy isn’t rocket science…but it’s close!It’s all about finding that sweet spot between keeping costs low and customers happy.Smart packaging choices can make a world of difference – think outside the box (pun intended) to slash those pesky shipping fees.DESIGN A COMPREHENSIVE SHIPPING STRATEGY\\nCrafting a shipping strategy is tricky, but doable!You’ll need to balance costs, speed, and customer expectations like a pro.Start by checking your current shipping process.Look for slowdowns and money-wasters.Then, do the math.Compare carriers, service levels, and packaging choices.Keep an eye on those yearly price bumps – USPS, UPS, and FedEx are raising rates by 5.9% in 2024.5\\nNow, think about your customers.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"mV+eCG1H2f1VxXQyn8wpULIx3XUo/xCrP0cnGZip2Qk=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5ac580c9-735a-4c96-86e9-43a090e158fb":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5ac580c9-735a-4c96-86e9-43a090e158fb\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.geekextreme.com/shipping-tips-for-small-businesses/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"597b1d5b-a38d-49e5-8f12-fd211b84ea8c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.geekextreme.com/shipping-tips-for-small-businesses/\"},\"hash\":\"b3OE4KXOF7OYeamjGffD+SOj5T4Fs+Rry35eb0OACtg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"ff110606-df95-433e-addd-197e6cca178e\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.geekextreme.com/shipping-tips-for-small-businesses/\"},\"hash\":\"mV+eCG1H2f1VxXQyn8wpULIx3XUo/xCrP0cnGZip2Qk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b8d856bc-3385-4ab5-91c8-5e96238a7490\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"c+tMfRS7ZLSIBI6nTvPtQdg8ZkU4SZMe8/4qraabbds=\"}},\"text\":\"Happy

about your customers.They hate surprise costs – 75.7% abandon their carts because of hidden shipping fees.Be clear about charges.Maybe offer free shipping with a catch.Set a minimum order value about 30% above your average order.This can boost sales and keep shipping profitable.Keep in mind, 36% of shoppers leave if shipping costs too much.It’s all about balance!2\\nA good shipping strategy is like a well-oiled machine – it keeps your business running smoothly and efficiently.OPTIMIZE PACKAGING FOR COST REDUCTION\\nNow that you’ve got a solid shipping strategy, let’s talk about cutting costs on packaging.Smart packaging can save you big bucks!Did you know that in the U.S., $1 billion worth of goods get damaged during shipping each year?Yikes!But don’t worry, we’ve got some tricks up our sleeve.First off, size matters.Using the right box size can slash your shipping costs.Think about it – why pay for air?UPS and FedEx use a formula (LxWxH / 139) to figure out dimensional weight.USPS uses a slightly different one (LxWxH / 166).So, pick boxes that snugly fit your products.6 Also, try lightweight packing materials.Bubble wrap and airbags are your friends here.They’re light but still keep your stuff safe.And hey, your customers will thank you for not having to dig through a mountain of peanuts to find their order!7\\nUTILIZING TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE EFFICIENCY\\nTech can be a game-changer for your shipping game.Smart software and automation tools can slash your workload and boost accuracy – it’s like having a digital assistant on steroids!AUTOMATE SHIPPING PROCESSES\\nShipping automation is a game-changer for small businesses.It’s like having a robot assistant who never sleeps!With tools like ShipStation, you can zap away tedious tasks.No more manual order entry or label printing – these systems do it all.They sync with your online store, grab order details, and spit out shipping labels faster than you can say “package delivered.”8\\nBut wait, there’s more!IoT devices are joining the party.These smart gadgets track your inventory and shipments in real-time.They’re like tiny spies…but for good!They help you optimize routes and cut down on errors.9 Plus, automated picking and packing machines boost speed and accuracy.It’s like giving your shipping process a turbo boost.ShipStation users even saw a 16% jump in average order value with their Branded Returns Portal.Now that’s what I call a shipping success story!IMPLEMENT SHIPPING SOFTWARE FOR MANAGEMENT\\nShipping software is a game-changer for small biz owners.It’s like having a digital shipping guru at your fingertips!This nifty tech helps you track inventory in real-time, monitor shipments, and even crunch numbers to spot areas where you can save some cash.10 Plus, it’s a breeze to use – no tech wizardry required.Good software is like a good friend – it’s there when you need it and makes your life easier.I’ve used these tools myself, and let me tell you, they’re worth their weight in gold.They slash shipping costs, boost profits, and make customers happier.11 Ship.com, for example, offers sweet deals on shipping rates and free home pickup.That’s a win-win in my book!SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE SHIPPING CARRIER\\nPicking the right shipping carrier can make or break your small biz.It’s not just about cost – speed, reliability, and

customers – they can’t resist it!In fact, 85% of folks say it’s a top priority when buying stuff online.15 But here’s the trick: set a minimum order value about 30% higher than your average sale.This way, you’re not losing money on every package.Free shipping isn’t just a perk – it’s the secret sauce of e-commerce success.Smart sellers use this tactic to boost sales.They show items that help hit the free shipping mark right on the checkout page.It’s a win-win – customers get a deal, and you sell more.Plus, you’re in good company.Over 95% of online stores offer some kind of free shipping at checkout.11 It’s not just a trend – it’s the new normal in e-commerce.MASTERING INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\\nReady to go global?Shipping across borders can be tricky…but it’s not rocket science!With the right know-how, you’ll be zipping packages worldwide like a pro in no time.LEARN ABOUT CUSTOMS REGULATIONS AND FEES\\nCustoms rules can be tricky.Each country has its own set of laws for goods coming in.You’ll need to know these rules to avoid delays or fines.Fees can also add up fast.There’s import duty, value-added tax, and sometimes extra charges.It’s smart to check with the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the latest info.1\\nDon’t forget about paperwork!You’ll need the right forms filled out correctly.This might include a commercial invoice, packing list, and certificate of origin.Getting these wrong can hold up your shipment big time.Pro tip: some countries have special rules for certain items.Do your homework before you ship anything unusual or valuable.16\\nSELECT CARRIERS WITH ROBUST INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS\\nPicking the right carrier for global shipping can make or break your business.DHL Express is great for small shops getting into international trade.They have a massive network across the globe, which means quicker deliveries and fewer issues along the way.Their technology is excellent, too, so you can track packages easily.2\\nBut it’s smart to work with multiple carriers.This approach speeds up delivery times and reduces risks.You’ll also have more leverage when negotiating prices.Here’s a tip: Build relationships with carrier account managers.They might offer you great discounts and benefits you weren’t aware of.17\\nFOCUSING ON PACKAGING AND BRANDING\\nYour packaging speaks volumes about your brand.It’s your chance to wow customers and leave a lasting impression – so don’t skimp on it!Think outside the box (pun intended) and get creative with your packaging design.BRAND PACKAGING FOR IMPROVED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES\\nGeeks, listen up!Brand packaging isn’t just a box.It’s your chance to wow customers.Think of it as your product’s superhero costume.Cool packaging makes people excited to open their order.It’s like Christmas morning, but for your brand!18\\nHere’s the deal: good packaging keeps your stuff safe and looks awesome.It’s a win-win.Customers love it when their order arrives in one piece and looks great.Plus, it makes them want to buy from you again.And hey, if your packaging rocks, they might even show it off online.Free marketing, anyone?19 Next up, let’s talk about making returns a breeze.ENSURE PACKAGING SAFETY TO REDUCE DAMAGES\\nMoving from brand packaging to safety, let’s talk about protecting your goods.Safe packaging is key to happy customers and fewer losses.Did you know?Each year, U.S.businesses lose $1 billion due to shipping damage.Yikes!That’s a lot of cash down the drain.7\\nSo, how do we fix this?First, cut down on empty space in boxes.It’s not just
