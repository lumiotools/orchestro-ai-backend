OneRail Industry Insights Blog\nThe Shipper’s Competitive Advantage of Delivery Speed to Market\nWRITTEN BY LIZ HAWKINS TAHAWI POSTED ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2022\nSpeed to market got a kick in the pants in 2020.Shippers had to balance a dramatic rise in orders, and consumer demand for on-time and quick delivery and fulfill these orders with fewer workers.But even during a normal year, parcel delivery can go awry.3PLs and other delivery companies employed to transport goods could encounter problems, either on their end or with the end consumer.And when that does happen, it’s bad news for a shipper’s profitability.As the logistics industry continues to evolve towards the consumer preference for online shopping, parcel deliveries are becoming increasingly outsourced to last mile specialists.The last mile market could reach $51 billion by the end of this year, up from $35.3 billion in 2019.And the 3PL market is on track to hit $1.7 trillion by 2026, registering 8% annual growth between 2021 and 2026.Demand for logistics services isn’t going anywhere.When employee turnover is high, delivery windows are shrinking, and logistics providers are expected to do more with less, the solution to managing it all could be combining technology and human efforts to gradually improve the delivery process.What is Driving the Need to Ship Faster?Ever heard of the Amazon effect?It describes how shoppers’ purchasing habits and expectations have changed due to Amazon.The success of Amazon has transformed the retail industry as companies have evolved to include an online shopping presence for consumers.As explained in Supply Chain Digital, Amazon offers a huge array of products at competitive prices and can ship most of them to a residence within two or three days.That ubiquity of fast, free shipping has led consumers to expect short delivery windows, regardless of what shipper they purchase from.In other words, expectations are changing at the speed it takes to get your next Prime shipment.Seven to ten-day delivery is out, and two-day shipping is in.The Need For Speed\nA Ware2Go survey confirms this phenomenon.In 2020, 75% of survey respondents told the 3PL providers that offering two-day shipping made them more competitive.When asked about the most impactful ways of increasing cart conversions, 56% of merchants mentioned free shipping, and 52% cited 1-2 day delivery.In contrast, only 29% mentioned free gifts with purchase, and a mere 26% referred to in-cart discounts.On the consumer side, fast delivery is becoming less of a bonus offering and more of a requirement.Data from the Retail Industry Leaders Association shows that shipping speed impacts buying decisions for 62% of shoppers.A staggering 90% of consumers view two or three-day shipping as a baseline delivery promise, and 30% of shoppers now expect same-day delivery.Delivery speed to consumers is a competitive advantage, but not every company is prepared to offer it.Those who do and onboard the right technology will leverage their logistics to gain a competitive edge.Why is Delivery Speed to Market a Competitive Advantage?Despite these numbers, many shippers have not mastered two-day delivery.Companies that do not evolve to accommodate consumer expectations for fast deliveries risk falling behind their competition.Two-day shipping can be time-consuming, headache-inducing, and expensive.Yet there are good reasons to offer it.Here are six of them:\nCompetitive Advantage\nCompanies with a handle on two-day delivery can grab a larger market share from businesses that lag behind.In today’s world, whoever gets a shipment to their customer first, wins.The prize is higher sales and repeat customers.Customers Are Attracted to Logistics Efficiency and Shipping Time Transparency\nOne downside of commerce shifting towards online vendors is that e-retail does not always provide the same brand experience as an in-store visit.However, part of that brand experience can be reclaimed by offering fast and streamlined delivery.It resonates with consumers, so they will be likelier to tell their friends about it or leave a positive review online.Reduced Inventory Costs\nFast delivery lowers inventory costs.Having less safety stock to store means fewer items taking up space in a warehouse and lower capital expenses.Repeat Purchases From Customers Who Enjoyed Their Experience\nAccording to the Ware2Go survey, short delivery times inspire customer loyalty.59% of merchants said two-day shipping brought in more repeat customers, and 39% mentioned positive reviews online.Or check out this SendinBlue study showing fast or free shipping is a primary driver of brand loyalty for 75% of millennials.Less Cart Abandonment\nShort delivery times lead to higher conversion rates.In fact, sixty-eight percent of consumers say that fast shipping leads them to place an online order.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fcGYGwlwQs65UmGNUeYDUWN9nLcfzXqM3XWwAxGxH0w="},"3562d580-fc9b-4d10-a3bd-0edf0b2d4d06":{"id_":"3562d580-fc9b-4d10-a3bd-0edf0b2d4d06","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/the-shippers-competitive-advantage-of-delivery-speed-to-market/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"b31284f0-eec1-4f46-8a46-bc95751f2444","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/the-shippers-competitive-advantage-of-delivery-speed-to-market/"},"hash":"aaJozrs1wfqvdjmeupJNw/H7VjJL/W7tXo8CjR50hcw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1ea4109d-f384-45db-9348-aed406dac99a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/the-shippers-competitive-advantage-of-delivery-speed-to-market/"},"hash":"fcGYGwlwQs65UmGNUeYDUWN9nLcfzXqM3XWwAxGxH0w="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"753cbf07-7c55-4707-89d6-f755bc38f1c7","metadata":{},"hash":"cYeHnYWXbJl0O802PfeLI9KuL9NuxvMrvd/ZuPqoqT4="}},"text":"However,

times lead to higher conversion rates.In fact, sixty-eight percent of consumers say that fast shipping leads them to place an online order.Conversely, eighty-five percent of consumers search elsewhere for better options when delivery speeds are too slow.And one of the top two reasons for shopping cart abandonment is that delivery speeds were not fast enough.A few days of the delivery time can literally make or break a purchase.Higher Margins\nBelieve it or not, same-day or two-day shipping can result in higher profit margins.That is because when customers need an item quickly, they will be willing to spend more money on it.Instead of doing price comparisons, consumers tend to look for the fastest delivery option.How Technology & Managing By Exception Yield Happier Customers\nSupply chains can be complicated, with many moving parts and opportunities for mishaps.When there is a hiccup, it’s referred to as a freight exception.A freight exception is a catch-all term for anything that might go wrong in logistics.That could include damaged packages, lost packages, missed deliveries, weather disruptions, or even problems with the delivery vehicle itself.As any professional knows, freight exceptions are inevitable in parcel delivery.But exceptions can also make customers pretty unhappy.A company’s goal should not be to prevent exceptions but to have a system to deal with them as they occur.Employing the right combination of technology and people can help keep the fallout from freight exceptions to a minimum.A cross-platform exception management tool can keep last-mile mishaps from spiraling out of control and prevent customers from deciding to end their relationship with your company.When choosing an exception handling platform, it’s important to look for a solution that utilizes historical data to anticipate future issues.An exception management system can amass logistics data points and analyze them to find recurrent problem areas and their root causes.But technology alone is not enough.When a parcel arrives damaged or goes to the wrong address, communication is critical.Robust exception management software will have people behind it to maintain communication with shippers and consumers.Ultimately, consumers want their deliveries when they are promised.Managing to stave off exceptions and course-correcting when they do arise can go a long way towards keeping customers happy.Choose a Partner Focused on Speed to Market and Improving Customer Experience\nThere are real benefits from improving speed to market, but cutting delivery times also comes with its share of challenges.The good news is that companies do not have to be Amazon to provide fast delivery services.They just need to choose a partner who can help them optimize their speed to market.Improving speed to market entails solving duel problems.There’s the need to eliminate as much manual work as possible, which is necessary to maximize efficiency and lower costs.Shippers must also maintain a human touch to deal with those inevitable exceptions.It’s a puzzle that can’t be solved with technology alone.Delivery problems have a tight deadline for resolution, and chatbots or general help lines are inefficient at best.That’s why it’s important to choose a last mile partner who uses technology to resolve exceptions before they happen and ensures that there’s always someone to talk to, without compromising either.Last mile outlays can comprise more than half of the headline cost of transportation.Couple that with high demand for free shipping, and the connection between a company’s last mile capabilities and profitability becomes clear.Shippers who can shorten their speed to market time and use technology to maximize efficiency have a competitive advantage in today’s market.This is especially true with exception management.That’s why OneRail created a platform that intelligently predicts and searches for resolutions to whatever transportation snags could arise.The OneRail platform has eliminated up to 90% of manual exceptions calls for clients and helps maintain a 98.6% on-time rate If you’re looking for a technology solution that gives you full control over the customer experience with aggregated prices from a vast network and puts you on track to compete with Amazon’s shipping capabilities in less than three

OneRail Industry Insights Blog\nThe Transformative Power of AI in Logistics and Last Mile Deliveries\nWRITTEN BY DAVID DAESCHLER, EVP OF DATA SCIENCE & AI POSTED ON OCTOBER 12, 2023\nThe logistics and delivery industry is always a massive, intricate puzzle.Every package, with its unique dimensions and destination, presents the challenge of finding the optimal route amid many possibilities.Traditionally, as I recently spoke about during my presentation “AI Before It Was Cool” at the Trimble Insight Tech Conference + Expo, humans played this game, often making it feel like a repetitive spin on a Vegas slot machine.However, the dawn of AI (artificial intelligence) in logistics promises a transformative change.OneRail is at the forefront of this revolution — we’ve been using AI in our platform for the past three years.Using AI’s power in transportation and logistics, OneRail has achieved impressive feats in the delivery ecosystem: A staggering 98% on-time rate and a platform processing billions of transactions, whether omnichannel or unified commerce.Yet this is only the start.As the complexity of the industry grows, the promise of AI delivery and decision-making shines even brighter.The Rising Importance of Data\nProjected to reach $407 billion by 2027, the AI market could also elevate the US GDP by 21% by 2030.In logistics, where data is as vital as oil, how do data collection and fidelity merge with AI to capitalize?The Pillars of Data: Collection and Fidelity\nEvery click and transaction leaves a digital trace of our choices.Yet, while collecting this data offers rich business insights, it’s about more than quantity.The trustworthiness of data, known as data fidelity, is equally if not more important.Without it, businesses risk chasing false leads, wasting time and harming their reputation.This concept has many layers to consider:\nAccuracy – Ensuring the data reflects the real value.Completeness – Having all the necessary information, as gaps can skew insights.Consistency – Uniformity across different sources and formats prevents confusion.Timeliness – Current and available data to make real-time decisions.Powering AI for Better Decision-making\nData is the lifeblood of AI and machine learning (ML).The fuel that allows these technologies to learn, adapt and evolve.With vast, diverse datasets, machine learning applications refine their skill, improving pattern recognition over time.The emergence of big data has shifted many organizations from hypothesis-driven models to a “data-first” approach, valuing the granularity and nuance of vast datasets.Yet, even small datasets have their role, with emerging AI tools transforming processes even when massive data isn’t available.Understanding AI in Logistics\nThe world of logistics is undergoing a seismic shift, thanks to the infusion of AI, silently orchestrating supply chains as packages crisscross the globe and delivery trucks weave through cities.But what exactly does AI mean in the context of logistics?Let’s clarify some common terms.Machine Learning\nAt its core, machine learning is like teaching computers to learn from experience.Imagine a child touching a hot stove; the pain teaches them to avoid it in the future.Similarly, ML models get fed vast amounts of data, training them to recognize patterns and make decisions.In the realm of AI in logistics, ML is the brainpower behind forecasting product demand or preemptively flagging potential shipment delays, ensuring that the supply chain flows smoothly.Predictive Analytics\nPicture this: you’re about to embark on a road trip, and a friend tells you the best times to avoid traffic.That’s predictive analytics in action, albeit on a much simpler scale.It dives into historical data, combines it with statistical algorithms and ML techniques, and paints a picture of potential future scenarios.In the world of AI in transportation and logistics, this means anticipating peak shipping times, determining the best routes to avoid congestion and ensuring packages reach their destination on time.Reinforcement Learning\nHave you ever played a video game where every right move gets you points, and every wrong one deducts them?That’s the essence of reinforcement learning.Here, agents (or algorithms) interact with their environment, making decisions and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties.It’s a continuous loop of action and reaction.In AI delivery and logistics, this concept is invaluable.For instance, it can dynamically optimize delivery routes based on real-time feedback, ensuring that the package reaches its destination and does so in the most efficient way possible.Real-world Applications \nMany of you have heard about the buzz surrounding ChatGPT by OpenAI.Did you know that GPT is primarily a prediction machine?It predicts the next word in a sentence quite accurately based on the context provided by the user.Similarly, OneRail can analyze data from our business to forecast outcomes, such as on-time rates or potential savings.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"FaasIRg9mtfKBfJ1JRYKtVfQ8j3vZwXZQVdZEMCJPZM="},"b2dfcd94-a8d5-4ee4-9bb7-faa84cd9d4c7":{"id_":"b2dfcd94-a8d5-4ee4-9bb7-faa84cd9d4c7","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/the-transformative-power-of-ai-in-logistics-and-last-mile-deliveries/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a93afd1f-ef1c-43e0-a579-ab372d53a32d","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/the-transformative-power-of-ai-in-logistics-and-last-mile-deliveries/"},"hash":"3/j38OLjAM+JmFJrFZ6KmaNKJydddJ6kGPWM85O+dwE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e031f609-02fa-4e5d-adf6-49c0ce577c97","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/the-transformative-power-of-ai-in-logistics-and-last-mile-deliveries/"},"hash":"FaasIRg9mtfKBfJ1JRYKtVfQ8j3vZwXZQVdZEMCJPZM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"309a9062-7447-4c59-b3cf-abc083b70c03","metadata":{},"hash":"ZjQuoJXrjLaCUniuNn94PlyoiBQ+x+WxpFtaETRhOqY="}},"text":"Reinforcement

based on the context provided by the user.Similarly, OneRail can analyze data from our business to forecast outcomes, such as on-time rates or potential savings.Additionally, given that 65% of consumers are willing to pay a premium for faster, more reliable deliveries, this could significantly boost profits, especially amidst the challenges of congested streets and increasing demands.Optimal Package Delivery Paths\nPicture Sarah, a small-business owner who ships artisanal crafts nationwide.Each package is a promise to her customer, and she can’t afford delays.So, when sending a delicate piece to a loyal buyer in a different city, she relies on something other than traditional routes.Instead, she leans on advanced ML models, which sift through countless routes to find the most efficient path.As unpredictable as deliveries can be, from weather-related disruptions to traffic jams to road closures, predictive analytics can help her foresee these potential hiccups, ensuring her crafts reach their new homes on time without a hitch.Efficient Deliveries\nHave you ever wondered why some products arrive faster than others, even from the same store?Behind the scenes, predictive analytics is at play, forecasting demand in specific regions.This insight enables companies to position their stock strategically, slashing delivery times.And in an era where every penny counts, dynamic pricing takes center stage.ML models actively adjust delivery prices in real time, considering factors like demand, distance and time of day.Think of it as the stock market of AI delivery, where prices fluctuate to balance demand and supply, ensuring both the customer and the company get the best deal.Humans and Machines: A Synergistic Approach\nWe’ve all heard of those dystopian sci-fi stories of machines or robot overlords replacing humanity.But, instead of the feared machine takeover, reality shows that AI in logistics is shaping a future where humans and machines work hand in hand, amplifying each other’s strengths.The Misconception of AI Replacing Jobs\nThe pandemic might have seemed the perfect time for AI to take over human jobs.Still, as Ty Findley from Ironspring Ventures pointed out at the Trimble conference, that didn’t happen.Instead of seeing AI as a job replacer, viewing it as an activity reshaper is more accurate.Repetitive and mundane tasks may transition into digital activities, but this doesn’t spell the end for entire occupations.In essence, while AI excels at handling repetitive requests, as highlighted by Trevor Ward of Rippey AI, it creates space for humans to shine in areas where they naturally excel.Combining Human Intuition and AI’s Data-Processing Capabilities\nChris Torrence from Optym emphasized that while humans are invaluable assets in any organization, our brains cannot process the vast amounts of data that AI can.In this unified blend of human and machine, AI shoulders the data-heavy tasks, allowing humans to channel their energy into creative problem-solving, nonlinear thinking, and relationship building.Chief growth officer at freight tech consulting firm Metafora, Ryan Schreiber’s perspective resonates with this, as he notes that when leveraged rightly, technology can magnify human productivity.Real-world Implications: Supercharging Logistics Efficiency\nOneRail’s story perfectly captures the powerful synergy between humans and AI.Before integrating AI, Onerail’s dispatchers managed 80 loads a day.With AI’s assistance, they now handle a staggering 3,200 loads daily.This increase showcases AI’s efficiency and role in empowering logistics staff to surpass previous limits and significantly boost their operational capacity.Moreover, by leveraging AI, companies can reduce errors in manual data entry and proactively forecast maintenance needs for vehicles or machinery.Last Mile Deliveries: AI’s Pivotal Role\nLogistics, the unsung hero of our digital era, ensures our packages arrive safely and quickly.Now, with the infusion of AI into this sector, there’s a promising horizon ready to address the industry’s most pressing challenges with renewed vigor.The Last Mile Delivery Conundrum\nThe last leg of a product’s journey, often termed last mile delivery, presents a unique set of challenges.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"K0gP6veym8rlvnb+tOBTNEnonvCODwPqIhrYe0P4KX8="},"309a9062-7447-4c59-b3cf-abc083b70c03":{"id_":"309a9062-7447-4c59-b3cf-abc083b70c03","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/the-transformative-power-of-ai-in-logistics-and-last-mile-deliveries/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a93afd1f-ef1c-43e0-a579-ab372d53a32d","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/the-transformative-power-of-ai-in-logistics-and-last-mile-deliveries/"},"hash":"3/j38OLjAM+JmFJrFZ6KmaNKJydddJ6kGPWM85O+dwE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b2dfcd94-a8d5-4ee4-9bb7-faa84cd9d4c7","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/the-transformative-power-of-ai-in-logistics-and-last-mile-deliveries/"},"hash":"cytFjnBiRGRwxBtvYbj0EDwOClqWaA1c+pfT1hlKCOA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3856aab4-aa64-4f8d-8005-d01b2359db9e","metadata":{},"hash":"j7RzPP8cxV+PXmhkF3lBsyD4Tb2mku/hT/QgC0XFxbU="}},"text":"Real-world

OneRail Industry Insights Blog\nBest Practices for Sustainable Last Mile Delivery\nWRITTEN BY BILL CATANIA POSTED ON JANUARY 5, 2023\nE-commerce and home delivery are now an integral part of our lives, with over 80% of U.S.consumers shopping online in 2022.Consumers are attracted to the convenience and efficiency of the digital marketplace, but while demand for faster delivery options is increasing, there are also growing concerns about the environmental impact and sustainability of last mile delivery.There is increasing pressure from legislators and consumers to decrease carbon emissions and establish eco-friendly delivery practices while simultaneously delivering goods quickly and efficiently.This creates a complicated challenge for retailers and shippers, but companies must be willing to take action toward sustainability to remain competitive in the marketplace.In this blog, we will explore the challenges shippers face in sustainable last mile delivery, best practices for improving sustainability and how technology is helping to drive sustainable delivery initiatives through optimization.Challenges in Last Mile Delivery Sustainability\nSustainable last mile delivery is an important supply chain trend that will continue gaining momentum in the years ahead.Consumers and policymakers are increasingly aware of the supply chain’s environmental impact.They are demanding more oversight and improvements toward sustainability, which present distinct challenges for shippers and retailers.Carbon Emissions\nSupply chain greenhouse gas emissions typically make up 80% of a retail company’s total emissions.As demand for last mile delivery grows, so does the number of delivery vehicles needed to meet increasing expectations for speed, resulting in more traffic congestion and even greater last mile carbon emissions.This is worse for food and grocery last mile delivery, as temperature-controlled vehicles create more emissions than non-refrigerated trucks.Meanwhile, governmental regulations and public pressure to minimize carbon footprints are gaining momentum, creating an enormous challenge for companies to find solutions and move toward sustainable last mile delivery.Complex Route Planning\nLast mile route planning is extremely complex, and the addition of more stops, more drivers, and more vehicles presents even greater challenges to delivery sustainability.Traditional static route planning is inflexible to changes, cancellations, added stops and detours, and can result in unnecessary miles, wasted space in vehicles, excessive carbon emissions and increased fuel costs.Optimizing route planning is critical to improving last mile sustainability metrics.Packaging Waste\nE-commerce and home delivery generated 2.1 billion pounds of plastic packing waste in 2019, a total that is estimated to reach over 4.5 billion pounds by 2025.Non-biodegradable packaging materials like plastic and styrofoam take approximately 500 years to decompose and are increasingly criticized by policymakers and consumers alike.Identifying alternative packaging options and prioritizing the use of recyclable materials is essential for last mile sustainability.Best Practices for Last Mile Delivery Sustainability\nConsumer demand for last mile delivery and eco-friendly delivery are increasing simultaneously, putting pressure on retailers and manufacturers to establish sustainable last mile delivery standards.This list of best practices provides tips and strategies to help companies reduce their environmental footprint, while delivering goods quickly and efficiently.Utilize Telematics\nTelematic devices like electronic logging devices (ELDs) are attached to delivery vehicles to record driving hours, distance and behaviors.Telematic devices offer immediate feedback on Hours of Service (HOS), driver location and vehicle speed, but also provide valuable data to improve two critical last mile sustainability metrics: fuel efficiency and empty miles.Fuel efficiency can be calculated through refuel and miles-driven data and can help identify poor fuel usage, due to driver practices or inefficient routing.Empty miles can be calculated as a percentage of total miles that an on-duty vehicle traveled without goods.Utilizing telematics data to identify issues in fuel consumption and empty miles is essential when developing sustainable last mile delivery programs.Establish a Multimodal Distribution Network\nMultimodal transport is well established as a key component in the global supply chain, but it can also be utilized for distribution models to provide greater flexibility, reduce costs, and improve last mile sustainability and efficiency metrics.Multimodal distribution models employ multiple modes of transport running under a single contract to deliver goods to the final destination and are customized to meet the time, cost or efficiency expectations defined by the shipper or end customer.Multimodal route optimization can improve last mile sustainability by prioritizing eco-friendly vehicles and couriers, eliminating unnecessary miles and reducing total carbon emissions.Rethink Packaging\nShippers committed to last mile sustainability must consider packaging materials and work toward implementing the “3 Rs” that have long defined waste management: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.Reducing the amount of packaging with smaller boxes or less stuffing minimizes waste and can reduce overall weight and improve shipping costs.Packaging that can be reused for shipping returns or another consumer use further minimizes waste.Utilizing recyclable packaging materials like paper, cardboard or compostable bags is easy to implement and greatly improves the last mile carbon footprint.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"QHcCQW4QUqqNi8vVMr8Cs9JYPA9MRMiagHDQEBzb7Lc="},"277f0100-b872-4810-81aa-1a078ff336c5":{"id_":"277f0100-b872-4810-81aa-1a078ff336c5","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/best-practices-for-sustainable-last-mile-delivery/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"28523a1b-5ee6-4501-abb8-00ac37658b11","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/best-practices-for-sustainable-last-mile-delivery/"},"hash":"S77k7/hsoM3JbvOuMak/H7oE+lPIWX2R/S+LkO45m2U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bfbb2cdc-67bf-47f1-97d0-bedee4ce31a4","metadata":{"url":"https://www.onerail.com/best-practices-for-sustainable-last-mile-delivery/"},"hash":"QHcCQW4QUqqNi8vVMr8Cs9JYPA9MRMiagHDQEBzb7Lc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"89a99467-525a-4741-bff5-1872b89eb2be","metadata":{},"hash":"SqAcXBeWcig2k1u3npbKqUI8nFQPStcmxIqEI+jNg5k="}},"text":"Multimodal

improves the last mile carbon footprint.Eco-friendly packaging is undoubtedly beneficial for the environment, but it is becoming increasingly important for brand sentiment as well.A 2022 survey found that 86% of consumers are more likely to purchase from a retailer that uses sustainable packaging over a retailer that doesn’t.Measure and Monitor\nData is essential to understanding the environmental impact of last mile delivery.Establishing KPIs and sustainability metrics helps identify areas for improvement and track progress toward sustainability goals.These metrics and KPIs may include fuel consumption, carbon emissions per month or per delivery, amount of packaging used, and missed delivery or redelivery percentages.By consistently collecting and evaluating these metrics, companies can better understand their last mile environmental impact and take steps to improve eco-friendly delivery.Partner with Green Companies\nPartnering with companies that have a strong focus on sustainability and environmental stewardship can greatly improve a retailer’s carbon footprint.Suppliers who sustainably source materials and transportation services from providers who limit carbon emissions are essential to establishing eco-friendly brands and products.Technology partners that drive logistics efficiency can further support last mile sustainability through route optimization, advanced data analytics and high-level supply chain visibility.Technology Solutions for Last Mile Delivery Sustainability\nLike many other facets of the supply chain, technology can play a pivotal role in improving last mile sustainability.Shippers should look for technology solutions with several key features:\nMultimodal Route Optimization\nComplex supply chains require multiple modes of transportation to move goods efficiently, but sustainably managing multimodal networks can be challenging, particularly in the last mile.Technology that delivers one point of contact between courier, parcel, LTL and FTL providers simplifies last mile operations and ensures the best mode of transportation for every shipment.API-driven last mile solutions can provide optimized route planning based on a complex set of rules to guarantee that every shipment is optimized, cost-effective and meets eco-friendly last mile delivery standards.Tracking & Exceptions Management\nMissed deliveries, redeliveries and unexpected route delays can add substantial time and miles to routes and dramatically impact last mile sustainability metrics.Real-time delivery tracking technology helps fill the gaps in last mile risk management with smart exception identification and alerts.This allows logistics teams to proactively address issues and reduce missed deliveries and additional miles to keep carbon emissions to a minimum.Courier Management \nThe growing demand for home delivery frequently requires onboarding additional couriers and delivery partners.However, a diversified and fragmented last mile network can present sustainability challenges.Pricing, routing, dispatching and tracking multiple providers can be a logistical nightmare.Technology solutions that integrate courier networks to standardize delivery processes can greatly improve eco-friendly last mile initiatives.Actionable Data\nSustainable last mile delivery requires advanced data analytics to ensure continuous improvement and to form predictive models that drive future decision-making.Predictive analytics allows shippers to move beyond the visibility of current sustainability issues and toward anticipation of future problems, opening the door for proactive risk mitigation and sustainability improvements.Improve Eco-Friendly Delivery & Last Mile Optimization with OneRail\nIn today’s high-demand
