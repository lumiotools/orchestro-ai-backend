CONSULTATION\nArticle: What's New in Parcel Management Technology Solutions?The U.S.eCommerce market recently broke the $1 trillion mark and is expected to reach $1.1 trillion in 2023, despite inflation and slow economic growth.eCommerce growth is driving explosive growth in parcel shipping.Pitney Bowes expects global parcel volumes to grow from 159 billion in 2021 to 256 billion by 2027.This trend has led to parcel shipping costs increases and capacity uncertainty.At the same time, consumers expect free and on-time delivery options.Shippers are responding by diversifying their carrier networks and implementing omni-channel distribution strategies, shipping from inventory sources closer to their customers.This has added significant complexity to parcel management.The days of relying on a single carrier to make all final-mile deliveries are over.To cope with parcel delivery complexity, logistics managers are turning to a next generation of parcel shipping solutions that will help them make more intelligent decisions throughout their fulfillment process to reduce shipping costs, optimize available capacity, and improve their customers’ delivery experiences.Why do Parcel Management Systems Need More ‘Intelligence’?The most basic function of legacy parcel management systems is to print labels, usually for a primary carrier such as UPS or FedEx.They were never designed to meet today’s demand for more complex decision-making involving many more carriers delivering from decentralized locations.Making these older systems do what they were never intended to do requires expensive customer programming and long product timelines, frustrating shippers, carriers, and vendors alike.An intelligent parcel management system offers shippers the controls they need to automate critical decision-making at every stage of the parcel fulfillment process, including order entry, fulfillment, and shipping.Using an intelligent parcel shipping system, shippers can more easily and quickly determine how, when, and where to use carrier services within their eCom, TMS, OMS, WMS, and shipping systems.Three Innovations Driving Parcel Intelligent Management\nIntelligent parcel management platforms have introduced key innovations that help shippers meet their parcel fulfillment operational challenges, including high-performance routing and rating engines, configurable (no-code) business rules, and parcel optimization planning.High-speed parcel routing and rating engines replace unreliable carrier APIs\nCarrier APIs have been typically seen as the industry “go-to” for rating parcel shipments.They are easy to use, and legacy parcel shipping systems depend on them to automate shipping execution.But they are far too slow and unreliable to support iterative transportation planning and decision-making processes upstream from shipping execution.They cannot keep up with the speed needed to support current B2C fulfillment demands.For example, consumers expect more delivery options earlier on in their online shopping experience.Logistics managers may need to weigh omni-channel fulfillment choices based on inventory availability, shipping costs, and delivery promises.Warehouses need the technology to identify the most transportation-cost-effective way to pack cartons and avoid unexpected DIM fees.All these processes could potentially require hundreds of routing instructions and rating calculations across a diversified carrier network.Carriers never built their rating APIs for this purpose.As a result, they have been known to shut off access or levy surcharges for excessive rate requests.Intelligent parcel management systems are intentionally architected to handle these demands.They feature onboard routing and rating engines that are capable of processing thousands of routing instructions and rate calculations per second.Their high-speed performance paves the way for iterative planning to optimize cost, capacity, and customer delivery experiences.Configurable, no-code routing instructions\nWith legacy shipping systems, engineers and IT teams have typically had to hard-code programs to accommodate parcel shipping rules.The result is a decision-making process that is often slow, unwieldy, and inflexible, making it difficult for logistics managers to stay competitive in the dynamic environment of parcel shipping.With an intelligent parcel management platform, logistics managers can easily configure their business rule instructions in minutes–rather than the days or weeks it would take programmers to code within a legacy shipping system–and then change as business conditions change, thereby empowering them to manage a more agile shipping operation that optimizes day-to-day carrier decision-making.Intelligent parcel shipping systems also provide a no-code way of onboarding new carriers.Rather than using custom coding to integrate carrier shipping APIs, a non-programmer can simply map data required by both the carrier and the intelligent parcel shipping system to execute shipments.This kind of connectivity abstracts the more complicated communication and transport layers.Parcel optimization planning and “what if” simulations\nLegacy parcel shipping systems typically consider one order at a time.They completely lack the ability to do order planning optimization or run “what-if” simulations against shipping historical data.That is because they were designed to process one shipping transaction at a time at the end of a conveyor.By that time, it is too late to engage in planning.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"SZOR5m1kyZt4J9o357yY9Sz69yVBWNDEgepVmaFIPBA="},"741df225-0e36-4cc4-a979-cb9c5f03065e":{"id_":"741df225-0e36-4cc4-a979-cb9c5f03065e","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/whats-new-in-parcel-management-tech"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"2e5e8a91-699c-4fa5-acf7-4b8dd6ca0fa9","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/whats-new-in-parcel-management-tech"},"hash":"d6LldbkC7tsTOaAVMlSVVQXgW/sDo0ua4jTHbuagyOE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3dc4e5bf-5c76-460d-843d-7858f2c996aa","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/whats-new-in-parcel-management-tech"},"hash":"SZOR5m1kyZt4J9o357yY9Sz69yVBWNDEgepVmaFIPBA="}},"text":"Intelligent

shipping historical data.That is because they were designed to process one shipping transaction at a time at the end of a conveyor.By that time, it is too late to engage in planning.The ability to gain a wider, more strategic view across many orders is not something legacy systems were designed to do.By contrast, intelligent parcel management systems can apply aggregated business rules and routing instructions, calculating rates at high speeds across many orders, identifying shipping costs reduction opportunities through consolidation, zone-skipping, or drop-shipping.They provide logistics managers with instant insight, the ability to compare optimized plans, and then release orders to ship or to batch process shipments.By applying shipping history to simulations, shippers can run “what-if” simulations, providing insight into the cost and delivery impact of using different carriers for certain zip codes, using a different fulfillment center, using a different set of carton sizes, or a carrier’s proposed rate increase.Simulations go way beyond legacy system reports and dashboards.They provide a view of what could and should happen, instead of what did happen.For

CONSULTATION\nParcel vs. LTL?Sendflex and ConnectShip Take the Guesswork out of Parcel Consolidation\nParcel consolidation can help shippers reduce costs while meeting increasing consumer demand for faster shipping, but to do so effectively requires the ability to identify consolidation opportunities during order allocation or warehouse management fulfillment processes, rather than at the point of shipment processing.Sendflex and ConnectShip have teamed up to enable shippers to optimize parcel consolidation planning decisions and execute LTL shipments to realize lower costs per pound and numerous other advantages.In an era where \"free\" and fast delivery shapes consumer expectations, many companies are looking for innovative ways to maintain their margins while optimizing the delivery experience.Parcel consolidation is a key component in emerging strategies, giving shippers the ability to merge individual parcels into a single LTL shipment to reduce costs and enhance efficiency.Through an innovative collaboration, shippers now have the tools to consolidate parcels early in the order fulfillment process using Sendflex TMS planning optimization and then process LTL shipments using ConnectShip.This strategic partnership is setting new benchmarks in shipping efficiency, enabling businesses to deliver exceptional customer experiences while protecting profit margins.Why Parcel Consolidation\nB2C eCommerce fulfillment is quickly evolving, driven by a surge in online shopping and changing consumer expectations.The demand for same-day delivery is set to soar by more than 20% in 2024, reaching a market value of nearly $10 billion.With Amazon set to expand its same-day delivery capabilities in the year ahead, it is imperative for other businesses to adapt their shipping strategies or risk falling behind.In response to these evolving market demands, shippers are adopting more innovative shipping strategies to gain a competitive edge.These may include carrier diversification to offer more delivery options and mitigate the risk of service disruptions.Or use cartonization technology to maximize packaging efficiency while reducing waste and unexpected dimensional fees.Parcel consolidation is another shipping strategy that allows shippers to combine multiple parcel into a single LTL shipment.Once consolidated, the shipment is labeled and documented for transportation to its destination, which could be directly to the end customer or to a hub for sorting and dispatching for final mile delivery.Parcel Consolidation Benefits\nParcel consolidation offers numerous benefits that can significantly enhance operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.Here’s a closer look at how leveraging parcel consolidation can be a game-changer for businesses.Reduce Shipping Costs\nShifting from individual parcels to consolidated LTL shipments can offer financial relief.This mode switch capitalizes on lower LTL costs per pound and reduces the impact of parcel surcharges that have multiplied in recent years.When comparing parcel to LTL, it's important to consider the logistics: although parcel shipments undergo more checkpoints, increasing the risk of loss or damage, they allow for closer shipment tracking.Conversely, palletized LTL shipments ensure goods move and arrive together, reducing handling and the potential for damage.Despite fewer checkpoints and tracking updates, the consolidated approach significantly cuts costs for shipments bound for the same geographic region.Faster Transit Times\nThe conventional view of LTL shipping as slow and inflexible is quickly becoming outdated, especially when considering the strategic advantages of parcel consolidation for deliveries in the same area.By employing LTL carriers for drop shipping parcels, businesses can bypass local parcel carrier hubs, streamlining the delivery process.Innovative zone-skipping services, such as those offered by Maergo, exemplify this shift.Maergo leverages commercial jets to transport consolidated parcel loads to distant zones (5-8) in just 2-3 days, matching ground shipping prices.This approach not only accelerates transit times but also maintains cost efficiency, challenging the traditional perceptions of LTL's limitations and presenting a viable, speedy alternative for parcel delivery.Fewer Damage Claims\nParcel shipping is essential for eCommerce and retail logistics, but it carries a significant risk of product damage, with estimates of damage rates varying between 2% to 11%—a figure that jumps to an alarming 21% for oversized deliveries.The repercussions of damages extend beyond the immediate cost of replacement products and return shipping, as they can deeply impact a brand's reputation and potentially erode customer loyalty over time.Parcel consolidation offers a strategic advantage in mitigating damage risks.By moving goods as a single consolidated load, parcels have fewer touchpoints throughout their journey, significantly reducing the chances of damage typically associated with multiple handling and transfers within parcel hub networks.This method ensures a safer transit, helps maintain a brand's integrity and customer satisfaction, and lowers the logistical costs associated with damaged goods.Reduced Environmental Impact\nConsolidating parcels into fewer, larger shipments is a strategic move towards more sustainable logistics, as it can significantly cut the number of vehicles needed for transport.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mhmFY9OjTQYlEJNtRWMdYXZbCaNP/PULFqb0LV3iauc="},"fd3a6ebd-a0f5-469b-bfec-1e01b841e0de":{"id_":"fd3a6ebd-a0f5-469b-bfec-1e01b841e0de","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/parcel-vs-ltl-sendflex-and-connectship-take-the-guesswork-out-of-parcel-consolidation"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"7ae25979-677a-4ef6-81de-7c67562609f1","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/parcel-vs-ltl-sendflex-and-connectship-take-the-guesswork-out-of-parcel-consolidation"},"hash":"c64QOiW6z+UXgqvjia0fx8bveWu9qXw5VWQUvnOPqtY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2c2cbb5e-a47b-481e-afc3-ad4c1604f48f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/parcel-vs-ltl-sendflex-and-connectship-take-the-guesswork-out-of-parcel-consolidation"},"hash":"mhmFY9OjTQYlEJNtRWMdYXZbCaNP/PULFqb0LV3iauc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"eb570443-924d-4999-9bcc-3f444b697b8d","metadata":{},"hash":"dinL+Gy3BnnK0BdE6JBxCxmknhZ8cptB4hj8fqfWRKY="}},"text":"Fewer

CONSULTATION\nParcel Carrier Diversification vs. Primary Carrier Incentives - Do You Have to Choose?The parcel industry is rapidly evolving, as the rise of e-commerce, direct-to-consumer (D2C), and omnichannel strategies continue to reshape how goods are moved around the globe.This dynamic, fueled by ever-growing consumer demands and technological advancements, has made the concept of parcel carrier diversification a necessity for businesses to reduce shipping costs, avoid disruption risks, and improve local delivery capabilities.However, diversifying carrier networks can be complicated and formidable undertaking.A May 2022 survey of 168 retailers by Pitney Bowes highlighted the top two challenges for carrier diversification: 1) integrating carrier web services to automate shipment processing, and 2) risking the loss of primary carrier contract incentives.This blog will explore the multifaceted nature of parcel carrier diversification and the importance of balancing the benefits against the potential risks.Throughout, we'll offer insights into how technological solutions, particularly parcel Transportation Management Systems (TMS), play a pivotal role in navigating these complexities and implementing a cost-effective carrier diversification strategy.The Shifting Dynamic in Parcel Management: Single Carrier Simplicity vs. Diversified Carrier Complexity\nThe parcel delivery industry is experiencing a significant shift, marked by contrasting trends in parcel volumes and carrier revenues.In 2022, U.S.parcel volumes experienced a 2% decrease, yet major carriers like UPS and FedEx reported a 6.5% increase in revenues.This supply and demand anomaly highlights how major carriers have pivoted towards profitability, rather than volume growth…or as one carrier executive explained “better, not bigger.”Meanwhile, Amazon is driving the demand for omnichannel fulfillment and expedited, same-day delivery services.These factors have shippers rethinking their final mile delivery strategies and considering parcel carrier network diversification as a means to adapt to evolving market demands.In addition to regional carriers, new gig-economy delivery services like Uber Freight and Doordash, as well as local couriers have stepped up to meet consumer demand for more specialized final mile delivery service options.And more recently, Amazon seems poised to step into the market and compete with the major carriers with its own delivery services for non-Amazon orders.But the expansion in carrier service offerings, coupled with a growing demand for localized and rapid delivery methods, has exacerbated the complexities shippers face in managing final mile deliveries.While the single carrier delivery model was simpler to manage, it no longer is sufficient to meet the dynamic demands of today's eCommerce environment.Simple “rate shopping” doesn’t work anymore.Shippers are left with having to make fast, cost-effective decisions about how, when and where to use a wider variety of carrier services during the sale, fulfillment, and shipping processes, while still protecting their margin and optimizing their customer delivery experiences.Routing decisions need to take many more factors into account, including customer preference, SKU type (fragility, hazmat, size), inventory availability, packaging, transit times, pickup limits, and the proliferation of carrier surcharges.And, of course, the preservation of primary carrier discounts.Key Parcel Carrier Diversification Challenges\nShippers face three key challenges in evaluating how to implement a carrier diversification strategy: carrier integrations, primary carrier contract compliance, and upgrading systems to manage it all.First, carriers like UPS and FedEx have some of the most sophisticated IT infrastructures in the world.For years they have made it easy for shippers large and small to integrate with their APIs to rate, ship, and track packages.Their technology is reliable, secure and fast.And while many regional and local carriers have made significant strides in carrier automation, the Pitney Bowes survey indicates that large shippers find these integrations surprisingly challenging, or that legacy parcel shipping systems may not be up to the task without a large IT expenditure.Secondly, one needs to understand the sheer scale of UPS, FedEx, and USPS logistics operations.A major carrier might deliver in a few days what a regional carrier could deliver in a year.This makes it virtually impossible for a high volume shipper to completely replace a primary carrier with a network of other delivery services.So for the foreseeable future, shippers will need to have at least one primary carrier, and they will need to comply with that carrier’s contract incentives, including volume discounts, while diversifying their carrier service network opportunistically.Lastly, shippers need to implement systems that are capable of handling the complexity that comes with managing a more diverse range of small package delivery services.Freight TMS systems have done this for years, enabling shippers to automate transportation planning, route optimization, and simulations across hundreds of LTL and TL carriers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"J87cak7zq7Tn8pDyLCE6/UdWHq8nMZRo28zKRcfKq9Y="},"242fe4fe-c219-4004-9d37-4eca50bb2805":{"id_":"242fe4fe-c219-4004-9d37-4eca50bb2805","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/parcel-carrier-diversification-vs.-primary-carrier-incentives-do-you-have-to-choose"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"12d33159-8d04-4435-9d28-2a2c2b534932","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/parcel-carrier-diversification-vs.-primary-carrier-incentives-do-you-have-to-choose"},"hash":"4iNMpMFkz15s5uW9W0hWwSWcsIMi7zqFWrwX6xCgrc0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"eb1f45da-20e9-4c92-8f49-908337955424","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/parcel-carrier-diversification-vs.-primary-carrier-incentives-do-you-have-to-choose"},"hash":"J87cak7zq7Tn8pDyLCE6/UdWHq8nMZRo28zKRcfKq9Y="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"01e868b3-ca68-4f36-b4bf-95bac4da7778","metadata":{},"hash":"7FvSBSprlhmHpnZ8XsLec7OwaVwFl399fesu3w1ONOA="}},"text":"Secondly,

CONSULTATION\nStuck in a Custom Programming Ditch?No-Code Parcel TMS Puts Logistics Managers Back in the Driver's Seat\nSendflex parcel TMS frees shippers from the constraints of hard-coded legacy shipping systems, unlocking new levels of flexibility, agility, and intelligent insights.In the ever-evolving landscape of eCommerce, decisions about how to cost-effectively pack, select from a growing diversity of final mile carrier delivery options, and efficiently execute shipments have become increasingly complex.Legacy shipping systems lack the ability to embed business rules without costly custom programming and long project timelines.As illustrated in this article’s 10 FAQs, Sendflex parcel TMS offers a no-code approach to data-driven, cost-effective decisions.Complexity Is Confounding Legacy Parcel Shipping Systems\nAmazon has revolutionized eCommerce fulfillment, emphasizing faster, more cost-effective and sustainable deliveries from fulfillment centers located closer to end-consumers.This strategy has not only transformed the industry but also escalated consumer expectations for more delivery options.Research indicates that 90% of consumers expect standard two- or three-day shipping, with 32% willing to abandon their carts if quoted shipping times are too long.In response, traditional brick and mortar retailers are playing catchup, implementing decentralized omni-channel fulfillment models while diversifying their last-mile small package delivery networks.Gone are the simpler days of relying on a single carrier to deliver from a centralized distribution center.Today, many more factors go into how, when, and where to pack and ship orders for timely delivery.And with eCommerce currently accounting for only 16% of retail sales, both the potential for growth and the increased shipping management complexity introduced by these strategic shifts are profound.Unfortunately, most digital storefronts, OMS, WMS, TMS, and shipping systems were never designed to handle the complexity that has crept into the parcel industry.They were designed to maximize fulfillment efficiency when shipping cost control amounted to simple “rate shopping” and applying tribal knowledge and rules of thumb.As a result, according to Intelligent Audit’s CEO Hannah Testani, today there is often a 20% gap between what shippers expect to pay for shipping and the actual costs that show up on carrier invoices which include a growing array of unexpected surcharges and fees.Of course, some legacy shipping system vendors can customize programs, using hard coded scripts to apply simple shipper-specific business rules during the shipping execution and labeling process.But these modifications are costly and involve long project timelines which tax scarce IT resources.The results are often buggy, brittle, and not very well maintain or supported.Moreover, applying these business rules downstream from digital storefront quoting, order allocation, and warehouse fulfillment is usually too late in the process to have any real cost and delivery quality impact.Logistics managers are thus left unable to adapt to ever-changing eCommerce logistics challenges.Today's shippers need a way to embed automated decision-making at every fulfillment stage to effectively control shipping costs, sustainability, and delivery quality.Sendflex has stepped up to meet that demand with a parcel TMS platform that empowers logistics managers with the ability to easily configure complex instructions to optimize intelligent packing, routing, and shipping decisions.Sendflex Parcel TMS Conquers Complexity\nSendflex’s Parcel TMS platform follows the path forged by traditional freight TMS systems, which always had deal with a more complex and fragmented ground, rail, and ocean transportation industry.Like freight TMS systems Sendflex grants non-technical logistics managers the autonomy to configure instructions related to routing, rating, routing, load planning, and tracking processes across hundreds of carriers.But unlike freight TMS systems which are more back-office oriented, Sendflex’s onboard optimization engine performs at the speed of eCommerce, efficiently processing over 20,000 rates, times in transit, cartonization, and instructions per second.Sendflex is perfectly at home operating alongside high-speed fulfillment systems, monitoring orders, carrier constraints, and supporting real time intelligent decisions across the enterprise.Best of all, unlike legacy parcel systems that can only look at one order or shipment at a time, Sendflex can look across batch waves of orders and apply optimization instructions to maximize savings.Sendflex can also run “what if” simulations that enable logistics managers to gain insights and measure the impact of strategic decision-making before operationalizing those instructions during execution processes.10 FAQs About How Sendflex Parcel TMS Optimizes Complex Decision-Making\nBelow are ten frequently asked questions about how Sendflex parcel TMS can be used to reduce costs and improve performance without having to pay for custom programming.How do I diversify my carrier network

incentives?","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"zMN8SDZBrfCQXRzhN5wM0Sj32rM17yR3b6c1yDLNGhU="},"8796afe0-029a-4de3-9ad2-a9278ea2c438":{"id_":"8796afe0-029a-4de3-9ad2-a9278ea2c438","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/stuck-in-a-custom-programming-ditch-no-code-parcel-tms-puts-logistics-managers-back-in-control"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e5b222ee-fba8-4410-b775-aa338e6e1541","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/stuck-in-a-custom-programming-ditch-no-code-parcel-tms-puts-logistics-managers-back-in-control"},"hash":"9DCWQBOyy+8NJibY3y0csL8TLxcDR9YE3In1nxQe2Cc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"723c4267-82fb-45d2-af2a-0c758004c1e1","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/stuck-in-a-custom-programming-ditch-no-code-parcel-tms-puts-logistics-managers-back-in-control"},"hash":"zMN8SDZBrfCQXRzhN5wM0Sj32rM17yR3b6c1yDLNGhU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c6609af5-7dcf-4a7d-8b29-d853dd85c6ed","metadata":{},"hash":"ibm+FfMi3mvKzThJaGO0yC11VRVZOzHQ1nvseGjlcoM="}},"text":"Sendflex

processes.10 FAQs About How Sendflex Parcel TMS Optimizes Complex Decision-Making\nBelow are ten frequently asked questions about how Sendflex parcel TMS can be used to reduce costs and improve performance without having to pay for custom programming.How do I diversify my carrier network without risking loss of my primary carrier tier incentives?For the foreseeable future, shippers will need to rely on major parcel carriers (UPS, FedEx, USPS, and now Amazon) to deliver the bulk of their parcel volumes even as they start to expand their network to include 3PLs, regional carriers and local couriers.Shippers work hard to negotiate the best primary carrier contract they can, which includes valuable tier incentives.If they don’t achieve those primary carrier incentives, it could offset any savings they hoped to realize by leveraging alternative carrier delivery services.Or worse.Sendflex solves that problem by monitoring spending levels for all carriers and automating data-driven multi-carrier routing decisions.Logistics managers can configure an instruction that enables routing to an alternative carrier service but only when they are on track to achieve their primary carrier’s tiered incentive targets.This ensures compliance with primary carrier contract commitments, preserving discount levels while enabling other delivery service alternatives.How do I reduce use of expensive express services by more accurately predicting carrier delivery times?The pressure is on eCommerce shippers to make and keep delivery promises.But so long as free shipping is the norm, care must be taken to accurately determine shipping costs to ensure margins are preserved or at least understood.Why use express services when a ground service is likely to get it there in time?Sendflex’s optimization engine calculates rates and times in transit based on actual delivery performance to specific destinations instead of relying on published ETAs.This can mean automatically shifting to a ground service when a package will likely be delivered at the same time as an express service.Sendflex also monitors carrier cutoff times.This ensures that if a shipment designated for ground delivery cannot make the daily carrier pickup, it will be either rerouted to a carrier that can or is rerouted to an express service for the next day’s pickup.Zone skipping services such as Maergo are also supported by Sendflex.This means that shippers can using Sendflex planning processes to take advantage of 2 day delivery to zones 5+ at ground rates instead of incurring express service costs for the same delivery result.How do I reduce unexpected dimensional weight adjustments and oversize charges on my carrier invoices?We’ve all had the experience of receiving large cartons with tiny products surrounded by fill.And no one likes it.It makes for a horrible sustainability experience for consumers as they have more waste to haul off to a landfill.Shippers incur the cost of using excess corrugated and fill material.And carriers are unable to maximize cube utilization in their vehicles, resulting in lost revenue which they aim to recover in the form of dimensional weight adjustments.The culprit is uncontrolled packing.Most, if not all, OMS and WMS systems do not take transportation costs into account when designating pick/pack instructions.Instead, they focus on efficiency because they lack the business rules necessary to reduce shipping costs.Sendflex can enhance WMS packing decision with cartonization instructions that take a wider range of factors into consideration, including:\nCarrier DIM factors\nCarrier shipping costs, and minimums (1 carton or 2?)Available carton sizes\n% fill, thickness\nCustomer preference\nSKU attributes: fragility, hazardous, shape, orientation\nPacking rules: don’t pack with, pack with, nesting, rolling, bagging, stacking\n\nSubmit an order or batch of orders to Sendflex’s API and within milliseconds Sendflex will apply cartonization instructions and return the most transportation cost-effective way to pack.In addition to monitoring dimensional weight adjustments, Sendflex instructions can be set up to monitor shipping processes and avoid situations that are likely to result in parcel carrier surcharges which have proliferated in recent years.For example, instructions can be set up to limit the use of certain carrier services such as SmartPost and Mail Innovations where oversize surcharges are applied when weights exceed contractual limits.How do I determine what the optimize set of carton sizes should be?One aspect of the unexpected dimensional weight adjustment problem is that shippers don’t know which size cartons to keep on hand.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Pg3qBCuEN5rORAqulRgyEx94Fkjh/5oACQl69s9Sz0I="},"c6609af5-7dcf-4a7d-8b29-d853dd85c6ed":{"id_":"c6609af5-7dcf-4a7d-8b29-d853dd85c6ed","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/stuck-in-a-custom-programming-ditch-no-code-parcel-tms-puts-logistics-managers-back-in-control"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e5b222ee-fba8-4410-b775-aa338e6e1541","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/stuck-in-a-custom-programming-ditch-no-code-parcel-tms-puts-logistics-managers-back-in-control"},"hash":"9DCWQBOyy+8NJibY3y0csL8TLxcDR9YE3In1nxQe2Cc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8796afe0-029a-4de3-9ad2-a9278ea2c438","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sendflex.com/resources/articles/stuck-in-a-custom-programming-ditch-no-code-parcel-tms-puts-logistics-managers-back-in-control"},"hash":"TX9ZSSrloBIQBmfB7VUNILpEKx5YioH1EZmcgZtuENE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5153bdaf-4828-4927-9cee-e1f1acc900d2","metadata":{},"hash":"FQnE+d8CCBGCXu2fGmUqtGSEXXK9Ko+9IBR+Efx/V00="}},"text":"Available

weights exceed contractual limits.How do I determine what the optimize set of carton sizes should be?One aspect of the unexpected dimensional weight adjustment problem is that shippers don’t know which size cartons to keep on hand.An infinite number of sizes would be ideal, but not very practical in terms of inventory carrying costs.Having too few cartons will likely result in more dimensional weight adjustments.Sendflex can use the PacSimulate tool to determine the most cost-effective combination of carton sizes to keep on hand.Sendflex can then run what-if simulations to determine what the actual transportation and material cost savings will be.How do I reduce damage incidents and the cost of returns?Another aspect of operationalizing cartonization controls is ensuring packing instructions include factors that will eliminate, or at least reduce, product damage and returns.As mentioned above, Sendflex cartonization instructions can include SKU specific attributes such as fragility, % fill, don’t stack, and padding.Sendflex returns animated diagrams that specify damage-avoidance packing procedures.Sendflex also enables logistics managers to apply a value coefficient that will impact carrier service selection ranking based on performance factors such as damage.A carrier’s shipping charge to a specific destination may be $15.00, but it could be adjusted to $18.50 based on their likelihood to cause damage, thereby demoting the carrier in rank, taking into account the true cost of using that service.Logistics managers can also use instructions to disqualify use of certain carrier services based on very granular variables such as destination zip codes or cities, SKU attributes, shipment attributes, and insured values.How do I manage more granular shipping and handling charge markups?For those shippers that can pass along shipping costs to their customers, there is usually a need to adjust actual shipping costs based on customer status, shipment value, destination zone, and a variety of other factors.Sendflex instructions can apply these calculations during digital storefront quotation processes or fulfillment, accurately updating customer service, billing, and other enterprise systems.How do I ensure I comply with customer shipping preferences?It is common for customers, especially large customers, to specify how they want their orders packed, which carrier services to use, or how they want to be billed.Failure to do so can result in penalties or lost brand value.Logistics managers can easily define and apply customer preference instructions to orders at any point in the fulfillment process.Sendflex simulator can quantify what the impact of customer-specific instructions would have been had they been applied to a customer’s shipping history.How do I ensure I don’t exceed pickup limits imposed by carriers during peak periods?It is now common during peak shipping periods for carriers to limit pickup volumes from specific locations.Exceed that volume can result in carrier surcharges or delivery disruptions.Sendflex can be set up to monitor daily shipment volumes and then automatically reroute to alternative carrier services once the primary carrier pickup limit is reached.A more granular “smart cap” instruction can be set up to limit pickups for certain carrier lanes while enabling pickups for those lanes where a carrier has more capacity.In this in other ways, Sendflex aligns shipper optimization with carrier network optimization.How do I know what the actual impact of a General Rate Increase will be?Every year the major parcel carriers announce a rate increase and every year every shipper knows that the actual increase will be higher than the published increase based on a shipper’s own shipping profile.Analyzing the actual impact can often mean having to engage expensive consulting services.Using Sendflex’s simulator, shippers can rerun historical shipping data using the new rates and surcharges and model what the impact would be had the GRI been in place.This enables shippers to proactively look for ways to use instructions to reduce the impact of the price increase.How can I use Sendflex parcel TMS optimization intelligence to enhance my existing systems?Many shippers have been months and sometimes years ensuring their enterprise systems, including legacy systems, work just the way they want them to work.Ripping and replacing systems is sometimes a painful

pulling up to their house with small products packed in a sea of unrecyclable Styrofoam peanuts, excessive bubble wrap, and oversize corrugated boxes.Sendflex’s recent ebook, 10 Brand-Enhancing Moves Retailers Can Make to Optimize Customers’ Delivery Experience, notes that sustainable packing is crucial in inspiring consumer brand loyalty.But consumers aren’t the only ones irritated by poor packaging.Carriers today are incredibly irked by the misappropriation of precious space in their trucks, which can incur penalties, just for starters.Here are a few things to keep in mind for better results when you set about fulfilling orders:\nPoor packing practices irk carriers and create more unrecyclable waste.eCommerce growth accelerated by the pandemic has created a surge in B2C shipping volume and started an unprecedented capacity crunch in the parcel shipping industry.U.S.carriers--from giants like FedEx and UPS to small and medium-sized carriers—struggle to keep up with freight volumes and are piling on surcharges and fees as we head deeper into 2021.At a time when every cubic inch counts, wasteful packing diminishes a carrier’s ability to maximize their vehicle space.The issue of poor packaging is not new—it’s just rapidly reaching a crisis point.Following the 2015 holiday rush when FedEx was unable to deliver all packages on time, chairman Fred Smith pointed the finger at poor packing habits.He remarked that there are shippers who “view transportation companies as some sort of utility, and they make some really, really bad decisions.We are getting lots of packages that were one or two cubic feet and inside was a six-ounce stuffed toy.”According to Republic Services, one of the largest waste collection companies in the U.S., household rubbish has increased more than 25% over the past year.Whereas retailers were careful to recycle 90% of the large, corrugated containers shipped to brick and mortar stores, now smaller, more frequent (and often hastily packed) B2C cartons end up as unrecycled waste at residential curbsides.Online retailers pay the price for shipping air.Poorly packed orders result in unexpected DIM fees levied by carriers seeking compensation for shipments that occupy too much space on vehicles relative to their weight.Moreover, with parcel carriers now rationing capacity, retailers who do not maximize shipment density find themselves unable to ship all orders on time, resulting in unfulfilled delivery promises.Most warehouse management systems (WMSs) do not take sustainable or transportation cost-effective packing into account during wave picking processes.If they did, consumers would not be hauling so much waste away to dumps.Instead, WMS picking and packing sequences prioritize by time and steps to inventory, leaving item packaging to guesswork or tribal knowledge.Cartonization algorithms improve consumer delivery experience while reducing costs.The good news for shippers, carriers, and consumers is that Paccurate’s innovative cartonization technology enables shippers to determine the best way to pack orders instantly.Paccurate factors in SKU weight, dimensions, and product shapes as well as business rules such as fragility, don’t pack with, carrier costs, and % fill.You can apply the same cartonization algorithms to building pallets or loading containers.With cartonization and palletization controls in place, everybody wins:\n• Shippers can reduce shipping costs, avoid unexpected DIM fees and load more orders in the same vehicle space.• Carriers can cube out their vehicles, avoid disputes over DIM surcharges and lessen capacity rationing.• Consumers are more satisfied with their delivery experience, unburdened with excessive waste removal, and more committed to their favorite brand.Sendflex has teamed up with Paccurate to help shippers apply cartonization technology to Transtream multi-carrier shipping processes.The combined solutions determine more accurate parcel, LTL, and final-mile shipping cost calculations in order entry and more transportation cost-effective packing processes during wave picking processes.Equally important, they enable you as a shipper to match your requirements with carrier capacity, constraints, and preferences.Contact us at learn more about how Sendflex’s Transtream multi-carrier shipping solutions relies on Paccurate to optimize the
