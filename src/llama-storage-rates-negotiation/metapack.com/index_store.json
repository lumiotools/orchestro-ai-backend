According to our own research, 86% of consumers will continue shopping more online well after the pandemic. And 42% plan to make fewer trips to stores in future. Opportunities abound, or at least they do for those that can capitalize on demand in a cost-effective and sustainable way.\nMake delivery your differentiator\nDelivery experience is the journey between clicking send and receiving your order, and it’s quickly becoming the most important differentiator for online retailers. Metapack’s most recent Ecommerce Delivery Benchmark Report showed that consumers are quite clear on what matters most. When tossing up between two retailers, 67% say that convenience is the most important factor. That means a range of delivery options.\nAs SME retailers scale, the variety of options their customer base demands also grows. Ambitious SME retailers must find a way to expand their delivery experience proposition rapidly but sustainably, and that’s where ecommerce shipping solutions like delivery management software can help. Metapack’s own shipping solution, Delivery Manager allows retailers access to a network of shipping services that suits their market size, with the ability to switch on new services instantly via one single API.\nReduce shipping costs with rate shopping\nAccess is one thing, but there’s also the issue of cost. SMEs need a broader network of carriers, but they don’t have the volumes to attract the discounted rates that large enterprise retailers achieve. It’s down to the intelligence of ecommerce shipping solutions to ensure sustainable shipping rates as SMEs scale.\nMetapack’s own solution, Delivery Manager, uses shipping rules to automatically select the service that can offer the best price while also meeting all the order requirements and delivery service requirements, for example economy, next day or nominated day. What’s more, Delivery Manager performs this process in the rapid-fire timeframe of 300 milliseconds.\nSafeguard your delivery promise\nIn our Ecommerce Delivery Benchmark Report 2021, 81% of consumers say they had a bad delivery experience last year. That’s 5 times more than the year before. It’s experiences like these that can turn off newly acquired customers for good.\nEcommerce shipping solutions like Delivery Manager can help retailers safeguard their delivery promise, once again through shipping rules. In this case, the logic checks against factors like warehouse cut off times, parcel weight and dimensions, delivery addresses and business rules to prevent allocating to a service that can’t deliver.\nThe capability can also serve as a contingency tool in critical periods such as peak, for example by diverting allocation in the event of a carrier outage. This helps SME retailers maintain the highest uptime and reliability, even during the busiest times.\nThere’s never been more opportunities in retail’s new normal, but the competition to succeed remains fierce. The SMEs rising to the top will be those who can scale their delivery experience quickly but sustainably, and above all effectively.\nWork With Us\nHome\nPartners\nCarrier

Peak Demand Season 2024\nFor the average consumer, the fading heat of Summer and the slow creep of Autumn signals the start of the festive season — right from Halloween to Thanksgiving, and culminating in the end-of-year festivities.On the other hand, for retailers, the coming of Autumn means the intense build-up toward the holiday peak demand season.This means the need to build inventory and bracing for the ensuing logistics challenges.Additionally, managing individual peak demand during these periods is crucial for optimizing energy consumption and reducing operational costs.Smart retailers have been taking on a different approach to inventory building in recent years.Rather than accepting an overstuffed warehouse that creates a bottleneck to logistics, ecommerce businesses are embracing a multi warehouse management strategy.This approach not only helps in managing inventories across different sites but also enhances order fulfillment by positioning inventory effectively.While shipping from multiple locations comes with its own set of challenges — such as managing inventories across different sites — it offers a significant advantage.By distributing stock across various warehouses, retailers can streamline fulfillment and distribution, making it a game changer, especially during the peak demand season.What Does the 2024 Peak Season Have in Store?Retailers are expected to feel the pressure in this year’s peak season, thanks to prevailing headwinds from the consumer base and supply chain complexities.This includes not only finished goods but also raw materials, which are essential for production and must be managed effectively to avoid disruptions.Maintaining optimal inventory levels will be crucial to minimize issues like overstocking and stockouts.Strategic placement of warehouse locations can enhance order fulfillment speed and reduce shipping costs.Continuing geopolitical tensions and high inflation rates have cooled consumer spending.That said, Deloitte predicts the 2024 peak season will see decent momentum with projected sales totaling somewhere between $1.58 trillion to $1.59 trillion, with ecommerce being a key driver for retail sales growth.“Although the pace of increase in holiday sales will be slower than last year, we expect that healthy growth in disposable personal income (DPI), combined with a steady labor market, will support a solid holiday sales season,” said Deloitte economist Akrur Barua.The Advantages of a Multi-Warehouse Inventory Strategy\nWith the promise of growth during the peak season, getting logistics in top shape is priority one.Depending on the size of the logistics network, some companies inevitably struggle with distribution and fulfillment, given that freight has to travel a longer distance to reach the end customer.This means higher logistics, transportation, and freight costs and an overall drop in operational efficiency (a warehouse only has so many loading bays after all).Add in peak season demand spikes, and the challenges can quickly become daunting, if not unmanageable.Shipping from multiple warehouses or stores changes the equation, especially when managing surges in demand during peak season spikes.Multiple shipment locations allow for a decidedly more flexible logistics network with better operating costs, higher throughput, and overall more reliable and consistent delivery times to customers.Storage facilities play a crucial role in this strategy.Systems that can track inventory across these facilities are essential for maintaining accuracy and efficiency.Close the Distance to the Customer: Customer density plays a big part in logistics.The closer a warehouse or distribution center is to high-density areas, the shorter it is to fulfill and ship orders.This means timely deliveries when and where they are needed most.Reducing Logistics Cost: There is a bit of a trade-off here, of course.Multi-warehouse management can increase overhead costs, but with peak season demand comes peak season freight rates.Shortening the distance inventory needs to travel significantly reduces transportation costs.Reduce the Carbon Footprint: Carbon emissions have been a hot topic in recent years, and consumer awareness is higher than ever.A multi-warehouse inventory strategy reduces the overall transportation distance even while increasing the size of a company’s logistical reach.Regularly analyzing warehouse data provides insights into trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement in warehouse management strategies.That said, this requires everything to be working in perfect harmony.Achieving this is no small feat for many SMEs, which often rely on disparate systems and lack the purchasing power and infrastructure of their larger counterparts.Challenges of Managing Multiple Warehouses\nManaging multiple warehouses presents a unique set of challenges for ecommerce businesses striving to ensure timely and efficient order fulfillment.One of the primary hurdles is inventory management.Keeping track of inventory levels across various locations can be daunting, and ensuring that the right products are available at the right place and time requires meticulous planning and coordination.Additionally, warehouse operations, including receiving, storing, and shipping products, become increasingly complex and labor-intensive as the number of warehouses grows.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fFmFq2TSUAt1HK9UbY1UhuqQaFthKPmiicDZgiltCSA="},"e6214986-2ed1-4a87-84bd-527fbec9f5c8":{"id_":"e6214986-2ed1-4a87-84bd-527fbec9f5c8","metadata":{"url":"https://www.metapack.com/blog/multi-warehouse-shipping-peak-demand-season-2024/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"47cba847-18d4-445b-9402-9aee2011f74c","metadata":{"url":"https://www.metapack.com/blog/multi-warehouse-shipping-peak-demand-season-2024/"},"hash":"N7rzVM5NHSP2VGC0nzyHG+cIgkinbbWNWggzzVihC5U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a941d650-1835-4d26-b47c-959b87140c03","metadata":{"url":"https://www.metapack.com/blog/multi-warehouse-shipping-peak-demand-season-2024/"},"hash":"fFmFq2TSUAt1HK9UbY1UhuqQaFthKPmiicDZgiltCSA="}},"text":"A

demands a high degree of coordination and communication between different teams and stakeholders, which can be difficult to achieve without the right systems in place.These challenges underscore the importance of having robust strategies and tools to manage inventory levels, streamline warehouse operations, and leverage data for informed decision-making.Seamless Multi Warehouse Management With

Customers said they were 87% more likely to return to a business after a good delivery experience, according to research conducted by Metapack as this builds trust between the brand and consumer. Building a good relationship is crucial to creating a trusting and loyal customer. \nThe data show that, beyond keeping customers happy with products and goods, businesses must meet growing consumer needs just to win them over in the first place. Some 61% of online shoppers opted for one business over the other simply because of better delivery options. Nearly half (47%) rate free delivery as their number one priority.  Simply offering an express shipping option for customers has a positive impact on a company’s business. A recent report from DHL about cross-border e-commerce indicates that companies offering express shipping options grow 60% faster than those who only offer standard deferred shipping 2.\nShoppers and e-tailers both want to know that they can schedule a package to arrive at a certain time, on a certain day, nearly anywhere in the world 3. E-commerce firms must be able to tell their customers exactly where their order is in real time and, should an issue arise, where a breakdown in the system occurred.    \n\"By offering a range of delivery options that address issues like order visibility, unexpected delays, and the quality that goods arrive in, you're sending a clear signal to potential customers that you care as much about the reliability of your logistics as they do,\"  says Andy Lim, Vice-President, Sales Development and E-commerce, DHL Express Asia Pacific.\nFor the world's online retail giants, having the capacity to meet modern customer demands is a standard part of their shipping infrastructure. But managing a worldwide delivery network is a daunting and costly affair.  How, for example, do small businesses offer a comprehensive international return policy? Reliable global package tracking, coupled with trustworthy insurance, is expensive to guarantee. And when customers have problems or questions, they expect a 24-hour support network and complete transparency4.\nSo what can e-tailers do to level the playing field? The answer: Let the delivery experts handle the logistics. \nCrucially, established delivery experts already have the infrastructure and name recognition that many online customers are looking for when they place their orders. DHL currently services some 8 million customers annually, in more than 120,000 destinations across the globe5.\nAnd you can rest-assured that the delivery experts are at the forefront of shipping innovation. Changes in last-mile delivery options are key areas where customers are looking for flexibility. This means that e-tailers need access to solutions that allow them to rapidly make changes to orders, have them filled at the last minute, and even offer alternatives once a package has already left the warehouse.\n\"Those who specialize in higher-end services such as international door-to-door delivery by a specific time will be able to meet your more demanding customers' requirements,\" says Lim. \"DHL, for example, covers a variety of delivery options including parcel lockers and delivery to its network of retail outlet partners.”   \nTeaming up with one of the leading names in global logistics is a natural step toward taking any business to the next level in e-commerce. E-tailers can build on the customer trust that is already in place and offer the delivery solutions needed to compete in the world of online shopping.  \nReferences","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4211,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ixfY2KUupxVorFa447gLchw6EB4t6IgVhZsEQDEjBnw="},"f85d9fb1-26c5-4be4-b5b3-2b0a5d819bb9":{"id_":"f85d9fb1-26c5-4be4-b5b3-2b0a5d819bb9","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-my/logistics-advice/logistics-insights/delivery-options-for-customers"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a7e18ea0-e3da-40cf-a18d-c9734959d2fe","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-my/logistics-advice/logistics-insights/delivery-options-for-customers"},"hash":"tRLep0LfTsnQ5sZSuRNapvMecnHfznzheBu+d7dBfvc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"69b1984f-afff-4362-a515-f87ce7f1124f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-my/logistics-advice/logistics-insights/delivery-options-for-customers"},"hash":"ayd/O0kv1PEMkvdepZT+egF2hZGyf10gUIP7SFySez8="}},"text":"Share\nSimilar Stories\nWhat is Certificate of Origin in International Trade\n29 January 2024\nUnderstanding Rules of Origin (ROO) in Logistics: A Guide for Malaysians\n28 January 2024\nAdding same-day delivery to your business' delivery options\n21 November 2023 7 Mins Read\nHow to use logistics to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty\n21 November 2023 5 Mins Read\n5 proven strategies to reduce shipping costs without sacrificing quality\n21 November 2023 3 Mins Read\n15 Logistics Tips for your E-commerce Business this Peak Season\n3 November 2023 2 min read\nHow to Use Logistics to Improve Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty\n26 June 2023 4 mins\nThe impact of COVID-19 on consumer returns\n24 February 2023 4 min read\nThe big benefits of 5G technology in logistics\n23 February 2023 4 min read\nDelivery innovations to reduce last mile costs\n27 January 2023 3 min read\nSix barriers to selling internationally – and how to overcome them\n21 April 2022 5 min read\nHow to improve your customer service with DHL Packstations\n15 December 2021 5 min read\nDelivery and logistics trends for 2022\n10 December 2021 5 min read\nBeyond Covid: the long-term changes to global logistics\n7 April 2021 6 min read\nPost-coronavirus supply chain recovery: exclusive white paper\n16 July 2020 10 mins\nFrom 'one day' to one-day: expectations in global shipping\n2 April 2020 5 min read\nLast mile delivery (r)evolution\n8 August 2019 4 min read\nThe Future of logistics\n6 June 2018 4 min read\n21st century spice route\n19 September 2017 5 min read\nBusiness and logistics insights to power your SME.

startups\nIn the competitive world of e-commerce, startups face many challenges and opportunities to grow their business and attract customers.One of the most crucial aspects of e-commerce success is the delivery of products to the customers in a timely, reliable, and cost-effective manner.Delivery is not just a logistical process, but a key factor that influences customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention.According to a survey by Statista, 63% of online shoppers in the US said that delivery speed was an important factor in their purchase decision, and 40% said they would abandon their cart if the delivery time was too long.Therefore, e-commerce startups need to pay close attention to their delivery strategy and optimize it for their target market and customer segments.Some of the benefits of efficient delivery for e-commerce startups are:\n- increased conversion rates: Customers are more likely to buy from an online store that offers fast, free, or low-cost delivery options, especially if they are in a hurry or need the product urgently.For example, Amazon Prime, which offers free two-day shipping for its members, has been shown to increase conversion rates by 74% compared to non-members, according to a study by Millward Brown Digital.- Reduced cart abandonment: Customers are less likely to abandon their cart if they are satisfied with the delivery options and costs, and if they can track their order status and delivery progress.For example, a study by Baymard Institute found that 55% of online shoppers abandoned their cart because of extra costs such as shipping, taxes, and fees, and 21% because they could not see or calculate the total order cost up-front.- improved customer loyalty and retention: customers are more likely to repeat their purchases and recommend the online store to others if they have a positive delivery experience, such as receiving the product on time, in good condition, and with easy returns and exchanges.For example, a study by MetaPack found that 96% of online shoppers said that a positive delivery experience would encourage them to shop with the same retailer again, and 83% said they would share their positive delivery experience with others.- Enhanced brand reputation and differentiation: Customers are more likely to trust and prefer an online store that has a strong delivery reputation and offers unique or innovative delivery options that suit their needs and preferences.For example, some e-commerce startups have differentiated themselves by offering same-day delivery, local pickup, or subscription-based delivery services that cater to specific customer segments or niches.Are you not getting the funds you need?FasterCapital provides you with full support throughout your funding

startups\nOne of the most crucial factors that can make or break an e-commerce startup is the quality and speed of its delivery service.Customers today expect their orders to arrive on time, in good

customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention, as well as increase the startup's competitive edge and profitability.In this section, we will explore some of the benefits of efficient delivery for

and speed of its delivery service.Customers today expect their orders to arrive on time, in good condition, and with minimal hassle.A poor delivery experience can lead to dissatisfied customers, negative reviews, and lost sales.On the other hand, a fast and efficient delivery service can boost customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention, as well as increase the startup's competitive edge and profitability.In this section, we will explore some of the benefits of efficient delivery for e-commerce startups, and how they can achieve it.Some of the benefits of efficient delivery for e-commerce startups are:\n- Reduced costs and increased margins: By optimizing their delivery processes, e-commerce startups can save money on fuel, labor, packaging, and inventory.They can also reduce the risk of damage, theft, and returns, which can incur additional costs.These savings can translate into higher margins and more resources for growth and innovation.- improved customer satisfaction and loyalty: Customers appreciate receiving their orders quickly, accurately, and conveniently.A smooth delivery process can enhance the customer's perception of the brand and the product, and increase their likelihood of repeat purchases and referrals.According to a survey by MetaPack, 96% of online shoppers said that delivery is important to their overall shopping experience, and 83% said they would buy again from a retailer that offers a positive delivery experience.- Expanded market reach and differentiation: By offering fast and reliable delivery options, e-commerce startups can attract and retain more customers, especially those who value convenience and urgency.They can also differentiate themselves from competitors who may have slower or less flexible delivery services.For example, Amazon Prime, which offers free two-day shipping and other benefits, has over 200 million subscribers worldwide, and has helped Amazon dominate the e-commerce market.- Enhanced brand reputation and visibility: A successful delivery service can also generate positive word-of-mouth and social media buzz for the e-commerce startup.Customers who are happy with their delivery experience may share their feedback and recommendations with their friends, family, and online communities, which can increase the startup's exposure and credibility.For instance, Zappos, an online shoe retailer, is known for its exceptional customer service and delivery, which has earned it a loyal fan base and rave reviews.To achieve efficient delivery, e-commerce startups need to consider several aspects, such as:\n- Choosing the right delivery partners and platforms: E-commerce startups can either handle their own delivery operations, or outsource them to third-party logistics (3PL) providers, such as couriers, carriers, or fulfillment centers.Each option has its pros and cons, depending on the startup's needs, budget, and scale.For example, self-delivery can offer more control and customization, but may require more investment and management.3PLs can offer more convenience and expertise, but may charge higher fees and have less flexibility.E-commerce startups should evaluate their options carefully and select the ones that best suit their goals and capabilities.- Optimizing the delivery process and performance: E-commerce startups should also strive to improve their delivery efficiency and effectiveness, by using data, technology, and best practices.For example, they can use analytics and software to track and optimize their delivery routes, schedules, and costs.They can also use automation and robotics to speed up and streamline their packing, sorting, and loading processes.They can also use customer feedback and metrics to monitor and improve their delivery quality and satisfaction.- Offering various delivery options and incentives: E-commerce startups should also cater to their customers' diverse and changing delivery preferences and expectations, by providing them with multiple and flexible delivery options and incentives.For example, they can offer same-day, next-day, or scheduled delivery, as well as free, discounted, or premium delivery.They can also offer in-store pickup, curbside pickup, locker pickup, or home delivery.They can also reward their customers with loyalty programs, coupons, or discounts for choosing certain delivery options or meeting certain criteria.By implementing these strategies, e-commerce startups can reap the benefits of efficient delivery, and gain a competitive advantage in the online market.Efficient delivery can not only improve the customer experience, but also the startup's performance and profitability.Therefore, e-commerce startups should invest in and prioritize their

delivery for e-commerce startups\nCommerce startups\nOne of the most crucial factors that determines the success or failure of an e-commerce startup is how well it can deliver its products to the customers.Delivery is not just a matter of speed, but also of cost, convenience, reliability, and customer satisfaction.E-commerce startups face many challenges in ensuring efficient delivery, such as:\n- 1.High shipping costs: Shipping costs can eat into the profit margins of e-commerce startups, especially if they offer free or discounted shipping to attract customers.Shipping costs depend on various factors, such as the distance, weight, size, and value of the products, the carrier, the service level, and the destination.E-commerce startups need to find ways to optimize their shipping costs, such as by negotiating with carriers, using multiple shipping options, consolidating orders, reducing packaging, and passing some of the costs to the customers.- 2.Complex logistics: E-commerce startups need to manage the entire logistics process, from sourcing, warehousing, inventory, packing, labeling, tracking, to delivery.This requires a lot of coordination, planning, and technology.E-commerce startups need to invest in logistics software, hardware, and personnel to streamline their operations and reduce errors and delays.They also need to partner with reliable and efficient logistics providers who can handle the last-mile delivery to the customers.- 3.Customer expectations: Customers have high expectations when it comes to e-commerce delivery.They want their orders to arrive fast, on time, in good condition, and with easy returns and exchanges.They also want to have visibility and control over their delivery, such as by tracking their orders, choosing their preferred delivery time and location, and receiving notifications and updates.E-commerce startups need to meet or exceed these expectations to retain and delight their customers.They need to offer flexible and convenient delivery options, such as same-day, next-day, or scheduled delivery, as well as pickup points, lockers, or drones.They also need to provide accurate and timely information, communication, and support to the customers throughout the delivery process.From Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos to Google and Facebook, many of America's greatest entrepreneurs, musicians, movie directors and novelists are world beaters.Gavin Esler\n4.The best practices of efficient delivery for e-commerce startups\nPractices for efficient Commerce startups\nAs an e-commerce startup,

deliver its products to the customers.Customers today expect fast, reliable, and affordable delivery options, and any delay or error can result in dissatisfaction, negative reviews, and lost sales.Therefore, e-commerce startups need to optimize their shipping and delivery processes to meet the customer expectations and gain a competitive edge.Here are some tips and resources that can help e-commerce startups achieve efficient delivery:\n- Choose the right shipping carrier and service.Depending on the size, weight, destination, and delivery time of the products, e-commerce startups need to compare and select the best shipping carrier and service that suits their needs and budget.Some of the popular shipping carriers include FedEx, UPS, DHL, USPS, and regional or local couriers.Some of the factors to consider when choosing a shipping carrier and service are the shipping rates, the delivery speed, the tracking and insurance options, the customer service, and the reputation and reliability of the carrier.For example, FedEx offers a variety of shipping services, such as FedEx Ground, FedEx Express, FedEx Home Delivery, and FedEx SmartPost, each with different features and costs.E-commerce startups online tools, such as ShipStation, Shippo, or Easyship, to compare and calculate the shipping rates and options from different carriers and services.- Optimize the packaging and labeling.E-commerce startups need to ensure that their products are packaged securely and efficiently to avoid damage, loss, or theft during transit.They also need to ensure that their packages are labeled correctly and clearly to avoid confusion, misdelivery, or returns.Some of the best practices for packaging and labeling are to use sturdy and appropriate boxes or envelopes, to use adequate cushioning and sealing materials, to minimize the package weight and dimensions, to print the shipping labels with high-quality ink and paper, to include the sender and recipient information, the order number, and the barcode, and to attach the labels securely and visibly on the package.E-commerce startups can also use eco-friendly and branded packaging materials to reduce their environmental impact and enhance their brand image.For example, Noissue is a platform that provides customized and sustainable packaging solutions, such as compostable mailers, tissue paper, stickers, and tape, for e-commerce businesses.- Leverage technology and automation.E-commerce startups can use various software and tools to streamline and automate their shipping and delivery processes, such as inventory management, order fulfillment, shipping label generation, tracking and notification, and analytics and reporting.These tools can help e-commerce startups save time, money, and resources, as well as improve their accuracy, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.Some of the examples of software and tools that can help e-commerce startups with shipping and delivery are Shopify,
