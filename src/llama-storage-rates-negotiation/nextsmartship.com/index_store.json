services\nWith ecommerce businesses nowadays, low shipping cost or even free shipping offer is the primary key to increasing profit margin.Due to the pandemic and supply chain chaos, freight carriers increase your competition by regularly raising their shipping rates.Obviously, in 2023 passively relying on standard freight forwarders with fixed price brackets is no longer a good option.Small businesses now need an intelligent approach that opens the door to savings reaching as high as 50% of “business as usual” freight charges.Here are seven ways with changes you can begin implementing today to reduce the shipping costs.Table of Contents\n1.Optimize packaging solutions\n2.Shorten the shipping distance\n3.Understand taxes and duties\n4.Freight forwarding off-peak season\n5.Become a loyal customer\n6.Insure with third parties\n7.Work with hybrid services provider, 3PL, fulfillment services\n1.Optimize packaging solutions\n As package weight and dimensions impact the shipping costs charged by shipping companies and carriers, it is essential to make your parcels as small as possible.Don’t forget that carriers also seriously consider the dimensions of the package when calculating shipping costs.In recent years, carriers noticed they were losing money on large – yet light – items.So that when the “theoretical” weight to packages is based on how much volume the box occupies applied, they charge for whatever earns them more money – the actual weight of the package – the “dimensional weight.”The fact is we are unmanageable to reduce the weight of products, but we can slim down the packaging and its infill.To avoid paying extra for space the package takes up; there are three main things we need to keep in mind:\nUsing fittable boxes with the products\nBetter fitting boxes means less filler material.Pack multiple products in one package if it is possible.For small businesses, it is essential to save as much as possible, so the best solution is to use the packaging provided by your carrier or fulfillment partners.It is the best offer to provide you with sufficient support for different products while maximizing cost savings.NextSmartShip’s Just–The-Right Packaging Solution here might be one of the best options for you.2.Shorten the shipping distance\nAll logistics providers set postage costs based on how close the origin and destination zones are.A package will have to travel between fewer zones with a shorter shipping distance, which means less expensive shipping.As a result, the customer saves money; they are more likely to be satisfied.The number of warehouses depends on your business size and order volume.That is why it is essential to work with an eCommerce fulfillment company with multiple warehouses.Amazon has hundreds of warehouses globally that quickly deliver a high volume of orders.However, for small and medium-size eCommerce sellers to deliver between a few warehouses or fulfillment centers in different continents and countries is enough.The remaining concern is the distance between the manufacturers and your global customers.NextSmartShip is an example of the best partner to help you solve all the problems.With two fulfillment centers on the West Coast and East Coast of the US, NextSmartShip can quickly ship out products to American households within two days.The other five centers are based in Canada, Germany, the UK, Australia, and China will help you deliver globally between 3-14 days.3.Understand taxes and duties\nFor global ecommerce sellers to ensure a smooth shipping experience, it’s best to understand the custom duty and import tax well before you start shipping internationally.Especially when you are currently using dropshipping or fulfillment services that provide tax packages, you shouldn’t rely 100% on them.Tax package solutions might include some hidden fees, and you might ignore the list of items exempt from import duty when your customers from all around the world.So the more you know clearly, the more you can save shipping fees without some headache terms that may come later.Each country has its specific import duty tax, which applies to each HS code (Harmonized System Codes).The three most common taxes are import Duty, VAT (Value Added Tax), GST (Goods and Services Tax).There are two main taxes calculation methods (also known as Incoterms).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"UUt+efE1YmyZRDXdzew4GTXIgZN9e2v0wRShFEjMdcQ="},"81290a39-cd21-4d6d-ba38-6b3a8319fd8d":{"id_":"81290a39-cd21-4d6d-ba38-6b3a8319fd8d","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/save-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"757c8088-d1cc-440a-a177-14226a066504","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/save-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"sfMlaPcTU3OBqrThs/Dw5HPTCX+lPnN6+wpH7QH/hk0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6a11ffee-f700-4d65-8936-8083e09563fa","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/save-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"UUt+efE1YmyZRDXdzew4GTXIgZN9e2v0wRShFEjMdcQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0a528d09-3206-41c3-a6c1-3323e3d430c8","metadata":{},"hash":"SWFOukxvuYUF3ckeLBjZIRUjHwg3LA903D37cJcvmcM="}},"text":"3.Understand taxes and duties\nFor global ecommerce sellers to ensure a smooth shipping experience, it’s best to understand the custom duty and import tax well before you start shipping internationally.Especially

Tax).There are two main taxes calculation methods (also known as Incoterms).However, to calculate it, there’s a lot to consider.Customs will charge extra taxes on your shipping costs which mainly depend on your imports.So to avoid complications while saving both time and money, you will need your freight partners to explain clearly about tax and duty of each continent and country you want to deliver the goods.Ensure that your shipping agency has no hidden fee and is 100% transparent to maximize saving up from delivery fees.NextSmartShip is a tech-centered fulfillment logistic powerhouse with complete visibility on many of the items mentioned above to ensure you know what you’re being charged for at every stage in the process.At the end of the day, calculating taxes shouldn’t have to be hard because our tax package solution is 100% transparent.Even if you choose to pay for tax when receiving a personal advisor from us will help you roughly calculate the tax amount ahead to help you ease the process of calculation.Doesn’t that sound nice?4.Freight forwarding off-peak season\nShipping a few days later or earlier can make all the difference with ecommerce online store owners by reducing delivery costs.Different from retailers, we can easily tell the specific time of the week is off-peak, but with global sellers, we are talking about at least one month difference between other seasons of the year.Traditional warehouses help you stockpile goods and charge daily by dimension and weight.The longer you stocked products there, the more you need to pay, so it definitely can’t be counted as efficient ways.On the other side, for warehouse and fulfillment combined, few services would provide free storage up to a month, so you can easily stock your products ahead of every peak season.For example, before back to school season, you can place orders for your seasonal goods one month ahead of September.All your products will be just on time to your consumers while enjoying 30 days of free storage services.Especially notice this during high peak season as the end of the year while supply chain unstable.Shipping off-peak is undoubtedly an excellent option for small and medium business owners.5.Become a loyal customer\nBecoming a long-term partner or loyal customer is always one of the best ways to enjoy the best services from any company, especially for freight forwarding.Therefore, spending time learning about shipping carriers while maintaining a good relationship with them from the beginning is an excellent way to reduce your shipping costs.As a newcomer or a small/medium ecommerce business owner working with more than one shipping partner is quite impossible when you serve international customers.So, finding the right and reliable shipping partner is extremely important.Cause once your supplier knows that they have and will continue to have a stable business for a while, they will offer you more favorable terms from time to time.Instead of switching to another supplier and trying several shipping services, build a better relationship with your current partner.You will soon be surprised by the benefits of close business relations.Every trusted company always brings out the best for their loyal customers.Plus, getting a long-term contract is one way to lock in a good price.This is a better option than getting adjusted prices up every year.6.Insure with third parties\nIf you’re shipping expensive things, you’re undoubtedly aware that insurance may be prohibitively expensive.Overcharging clients for insurance expenses is how UPS, FedEx, and other carriers generate money.For every $100 of insurance, carriers typically charge around 80 cents.Other third-party organizations, such as Parcel Insurance Plan (PIP) and U-PIC Shipping Insurance, charge a fraction of the price, often around 45 cents every $100.It can save you over half of your money!This allows you to actively work to spend less money to acquire your customers, saving a lot from the shipping cost and even working with the ROI for high-value products.7.Work with hybrid services provider, 3PL, fulfillment services\n Nowadays, hybrid shipping services like UPS SurePost and FedEx SmartPost with affordable and fast shipping services meet with most ecommerce business owners.They offer post office pickup and deliver packages directly to your customers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"OzfIUzDUBn+BOLDfq2W6ANTx3H4Ea7MAR7Kv7uLhMoI="},"0a528d09-3206-41c3-a6c1-3323e3d430c8":{"id_":"0a528d09-3206-41c3-a6c1-3323e3d430c8","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/save-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"757c8088-d1cc-440a-a177-14226a066504","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/save-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"sfMlaPcTU3OBqrThs/Dw5HPTCX+lPnN6+wpH7QH/hk0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"81290a39-cd21-4d6d-ba38-6b3a8319fd8d","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/save-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"YtdwRx6jGHnFF6XX2I7RFbVA9YkE2xdUspC7EXsATqY="}},"text":"6.Insure

Tips to Reduce Shipping Costs\nShipping is critical for e-commerce businesses.It intimidates some merchants, but they need to address it.They need to learn about the latest tips for lowering shipping costs.But first, it’s important to know the basics of shipping costs;\nYour export costs when shipping internationally\nThe labor cost of shipping the package\nThe cost of packing materials\nCourier costs for delivering the package to the customer.E-commerce shipping is getting faster and faster thanks to Amazon.However, shipping costs are skyrocketing proportionally.This disadvantage affects retailers’ profit margins.According to Statista, 63% of respondents said they abandoned online shopping carts because of high shipping costs.In another survey by Deloitte, 72% of consumers cited ‘free shipping’ as a significant factor when shopping online.So it’s up to retailers to find ways to lower shipping costs and increase profits.Here are some tips for lowering shipping costs for small businesses.12 Tips to Reduce Shipping Costs that Boost Profits\n  1.Keep an Eye on Shipping Rates\nSince shipping costs are crucial to running a successful e-commerce store, keep an eye on shipping rate changes.Major international shipping service providers  updates their shipping rates every January of the year.In addition, carriers add surcharges during quarterly earnings, such as the fourth quarter, which is often the holiday peak season for the holidays.To remain profitable during this time, you may need to factor these increases in shipping charges into your product or shipping costs.2.Consider Flat-rate Shipping When Possible\nFlat rate shipping is when the shipping charges are not tied to the size, dimensions or weight of the package.Considering a flat-rate shipping model can help your business save on fluctuating shipping costs, especially during peak periods.You can take advantage of flat-rate shipping by consolidating packages into smaller packages when moving them to final-mile delivery distribution points.By reducing shipping costs, you can offer customers volume sales improving your bottom line.3.Partner with 3PLs for International Shipping\nThe role of a third-party logistics (3PL) partner is to optimize order fulfillment by reducing shipping costs and shortening delivery distances.Shipping zones that measure how far your package travels to reach the end customer impact your shipping costs.In the United States, for example, shipping carriers span from Zone 1 to 8, with the point of origin being zone 1.Small businesses can reduce their shipping costs by working internationally with 3PL providers with fulfillment centers.Here are some ways 3PL fulfillment companies like NextSmartShip can reduce shipping costs;\n3PL providers are experienced in product packaging.And in the case of returns you’ll pay less and the re-shipping process.Their experience in managing fulfillment centers around the world allows them to optimize inventory management for your business.Sending inventory closer to customers for fast delivery.Flexible fulfillment centers in major cities worldwide give merchants room to scale or down without many operational costs.4.Consider Prepaid Shipping\nYou can reduce shipping fees by purchasing numerous prepaid shipping labels from carriers like FedEx and UPS.A prepaid shipping label contains the destination address, shipment type, and barcode with all required information.To generate a prepaid shipping label, you must pay for it before it’s generated.However, if you receive the shipping label from someone else, you will not pay anything.This method enables merchants to ship packages at no additional cost.5.Resize Packaging Dimensions\nYour shipping costs are dependent on the size of your packages.And if you are paying for packaging, you may need to resize your packaging.If you can consolidate products meant for the same delivery destination, figure out which package size is optimal.Also, some shipping carriers like FedEx, USPS, UPS, and DHL Express offer free packages of various sizes when you pay for shipping under specific delivery addresses.Take advantage of these offers.Other benefits of resizing packaging dimensions include;\nBetter protection for packages.Customer satisfaction results by showing you care about the environment with appropriate packaging sizes.Reduce carbon footprint by saving freight truck space.6.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"atett9oEhSM868vWZP5xDFFWVgKYRnOe5Qhvvc+Nh7g="},"69aee694-b69f-4dc5-9116-591e0e901508":{"id_":"69aee694-b69f-4dc5-9116-591e0e901508","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/reduce-shipping-cost/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f209d5d0-e00f-484c-87f8-3ad5343b438b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/reduce-shipping-cost/"},"hash":"ID+yYryMpVzBwmpa3uySLttsQbMtbBfqf2lCaA3TJII="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"acf1bafb-c51c-4477-884f-511c22b953fc","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/reduce-shipping-cost/"},"hash":"atett9oEhSM868vWZP5xDFFWVgKYRnOe5Qhvvc+Nh7g="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3123f5a3-1fe2-4321-8f66-511a4edaafec","metadata":{},"hash":"JDD357g6OdknM02I5zihU13PTdghdHF03qStBsIAP+0="}},"text":"A

about the environment with appropriate packaging sizes.Reduce carbon footprint by saving freight truck space.6.Get Discounted Shipping Rates\nConsider the following factors when determining how to get discounted shipping rates;\nCharged Weight\n Knowing the dimensional ( DIM) weight, which converts cubic volume to weight using a divisor, is essential.Fuel Surcharge\nSince a fuel surcharge is applied to each package, based on standard nationwide fuel prices, you can negotiate a shipping discount at the contract level.Services\nDepending on the shipping service on offer, for instance, you do next early morning delivery or consider cheaper shipping service like next day PM delivery.7.Use Discounted Supplies\nPackaging boxes, poly mailers, and dunnage can save shipping expenses when bought in bulk.Carriers like FedEx, UPS, and USPS offer small businesses discounts on certain packing materials.8.Consider Multi-carrier Strategy\nAs a merchant, sticking with the first shipping carrier you find is excellent.However, you may be missing shipment cost reduction opportunities when using multi-carriers.Without an exclusive carrier, you can negotiate for lower shipping costs and get other benefits, including;\nMitigating shipping risks like one carrier failing to deliver customer packages on time.Also, if they raise their rates, you have an option to switch carriers.Choosing the right service for your e-commerce store.Some carriers are specialized types of packages they ship.For instance, heavy and fragile items may require carriers with safety equipment for such packages.9.Reduce the Weight of Packages\nThe heavier the actual weight of the package, the higher the shipping costs.Some ways to reduce packages include;\nUse lightweight packaging materials like packing paper or foam inserts to keep the package tight and lightweight.Design custom packaging that mirrors the product.The closer the shipping package is to the items, the less material it will use.Use corrugated boxes.This e-commerce packaging material is more robust and lighter than cardboard boxes.10.Use Third-party Shipping Insurance\nA recent survey indicates that 43.9% expect a refund of discounted shipping costs when customer packages are damaged.Depending on the product, third-party package insurance can save your business on shipping costs than going for shipping insurance offered by the carrier.11.Check Offers on the Marketplaces you sell on.For example, if you use Shopify to power your e-commerce, it has partnered with shipment carriers like UPS to offer shipping discounts to its merchants.Additionally, the partnerships have integrated real-time carrier rates and fulfillment provider apps to select the one that suits your business.12.Offer Local Pick-up Delivery\nCustomers can buy a product from an online store and pick it up at their local store.Offering local or pick-up delivery reduces shipping costs for you and the customer.Also, local delivery allows you to;\nConnect with your local community; they can shop at your store in person if you own one.Increase your average order value ( AOV)\nImprove customer experience by reducing delivery costs and delays.Over to You – Use the Tips to Reduce Shipping Costs\nAs a merchant, you may already be using these tips to reduce shipping costs for your e-commerce store.Those out of your control negotiate with your long-term carriers to offer you the best deals.Consider a global fulfillment partner if your e-commerce business does international package delivery.This will shorten your delivery distance, which reduces your shipment costs.Get Custom Solutions\nLooking for a Fulfillment

shipping?Ecommerce shipping refers to the collective strategies implemented by eCommerce retailers to deliver products to their customers.It is a vital part of any eCommerce operation.The basics\nShipments\nFirst, you need to know what constitutes a shipment.It may be one item or several, resulting from an order for multiple products from a single customer.A single customer order might also necessitate numerous shipments if it is a large item that can’t be shipped all at once.Shipping management\nAutomated inventory management, mainly when your products are listed on multiple platforms, is an essential requirement.Shipping management software will help you stay organised.It will also monitor the status of all your orders in real-time.Essential trends for the industry\nGlobalization\nEcommerce brands are moving away from localization, and have now embraced the world as their market.The demand for non-local products among consumers is only increasing.Over 2 billion consumers are expected to buy products online by 2021\nTechnology\nThe adoption of technology has enhanced revenues, efficiency, minimized errors, and enabled improved operational structure.Implementing software solutions such as automated shipping or chatbots can improve customer experience by allowing order tracking and similar services.Multi-channel strategy\nRelying on a single eCommerce platform like Amazon or eBay is gradually falling out of favor with online sellers.The new, more effective approach is to have a presence on several channels as this maximizes the chances of a sale.Delivery optimization\nCustomers prefer short wait times and same-day delivery, so it is a growing trend among sellers.Surveys suggest that nearly 90% of all online buyers will pay more to have same-day delivery.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"q/z3LkPZ+dhUrT1IG1SSlH8N2ntuTNHFSd7ZC43UDdk="},"31d8de46-e506-4441-8a78-df827fba3665":{"id_":"31d8de46-e506-4441-8a78-df827fba3665","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55526847-6d5b-4f66-8dec-4cbada312086","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"GiayCjEM4RsmmFK8xpU20MdPlSKrOMbS+cl2vZltvlw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"db378def-acf9-4fd1-a57c-a689da3c7c0b","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"q/z3LkPZ+dhUrT1IG1SSlH8N2ntuTNHFSd7ZC43UDdk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"be1d9796-9b3e-4031-a012-40186c39b9b7","metadata":{},"hash":"6qtiwmqk5npsN9rlEWQiJ22dngrZtUm1EPL+uTL8rmU="}},"text":"Essential

online buyers will pay more to have same-day delivery.Customized packaging\nMost eCommerce retailers are spending more on package design.Custom packaging improves the perceived value products offer, thereby strengthening brand perception and enhancing brand loyalty.Chapter 2: Ecommerce shipping strategies\nEcommerce shipping is a multi-faceted process that requires several components to work.This chapter discusses all the available methods you may use to deliver products to your customers.Couriers\nCourier services are private firms that ship parcels and essential documents.The type of courier you choose depends on your shipping and delivery preferences.Types of courier service\nTime-sensitive shipping\nIntelligent routing\nOnboard courier\nInternational shipping\nTime-sensitive shipping\nThis service aims to deliver packages within a specific time.It is restricted to local deliveries and covers eCommerce delivery strategies such as same-day and next day delivery.Intelligent routing\nThis approach considers geography, weather conditions, and several other factors to determine the most viable shipping routes.Onboard courier\nThis service is ideal for personal items that require careful handling.The packages do not leave the courier’s sight.International shipping\nInternational shipping has to deal with delivery with a global view.That is, customers from different countries can have their orders delivered to them.However, these courier services are usually more expensive than standard mail services, but varies in pricing depending on the location and the speed at which it ought to be delivered for the duration of the shipping process.Postal services\nA postal service is a government-owned shipping company.Just like a courier service, it’s used to deliver essential documents and parcels.However, it is more susceptible to delays.Differences between couriers and postal services\nPrice: postal services are less expensive than couriers.However, couriers are more reliable, and using their services guarantees your package will arrive on-time\nService quality: postal services offer limited customer service.Although some are more reliable than others, customer support is generally restricted.Couriers, on the other hand, have dedicated customer support structures.Third-party shipping\nAny successful eCommerce brand, no matter how large or small, must be ready to work with third parties.Unless you’re Amazon, it’s impossible to do it all.Working with a reliable eCommerce shipping company grants you their hard-earned experience and expertise, and lets you focus on other vital parts of your business.However, as a brand owner, you must realize that your customers’ perception of your brand can significantly affect your sales and make or break your business.Although you can have direct control over most facets of your customers’ experience, once you hand a package off for delivery, the larger part of what happens next is handed over to whichever company you handed your shipping process to.If the package arrives late, damaged, or worse, gets lost in transit, you probably won’t get any chance to impress.Consequently, you should do business with reliable third parties.Same day delivery\nSame-day delivery involves delivering items less than 24 hours after an order is confirmed and usually occurs within the same day.If the orders are processed in the afternoon, the items will be delivered at the start of the next day.It is received usually limited to large urban centers.Shipments in these areas can be made in a single day as they’re often situated close to warehouses and distribution points.Small towns rarely have that kind of infrastructure, so quick deliveries aren’t possible.Same-day delivery doesn’t work for holidays, as it would be hard to deliver orders made on New Year’s Day, Christmas and other holidays.Overnight shipping\nOvernight shipping is a delivery strategy in which customers are assured of delivery on the next business day.The term is often used synonymously with one-day shipping or next-day delivery.However, specific delivery dates are determined by the period in which the orders are placed.Shipping carriers often have daily deadlines after which delivery for the next day is no longer feasible.Furthermore, depending on the shipping service and courier used, orders placed during the weekend may require an extra day.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mkOidUGJYemLK44BxE7ezZQVfNhdNaoTWNnvZL5HC4M="},"be1d9796-9b3e-4031-a012-40186c39b9b7":{"id_":"be1d9796-9b3e-4031-a012-40186c39b9b7","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55526847-6d5b-4f66-8dec-4cbada312086","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"GiayCjEM4RsmmFK8xpU20MdPlSKrOMbS+cl2vZltvlw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"31d8de46-e506-4441-8a78-df827fba3665","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"0lh5UldJGEP/bARPx+FCX9bm/dV6DGJST/mQoVwEVKo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8198fbd0-787e-48ad-8066-6166726508a1","metadata":{},"hash":"YSKGF5NJl7OOtkBAEtLjwpknpOT14+EsYNBSZujeC0U="}},"text":"If

placed.Shipping carriers often have daily deadlines after which delivery for the next day is no longer feasible.Furthermore, depending on the shipping service and courier used, orders placed during the weekend may require an extra day.Expedited shipping\nExpedited shipping involves sending a parcel at a quicker pace than that offered by ground shipping.For most couriers, expedited shipping implies delivery at a faster rate than the usual.International shipping\nStatistics say that 70% of online buyers prefer to buy internationally.Shipping your products to the international market can give vital growth to your business.International shipping cannot be as fast as the domestic one.Expedited shipping usually takes 3-12 business days to reach the destination.Besides, custom processing may add a few extra days.For express service (DHL/FedEx/UPS), it takes about 3-7 business days from China to US.Remember, shipments going to various states or across the country can still give expedited delivery.It needs the right planning and logistics.What is vital here is being reasonable with the timeline.For example, overnight or next day delivery might not be possible across the country.Freight shipping\nFreight shipping involves the transit of cargo via land, air, or sea.Any shipment whose dimensions exceeds 30x30x30 inches or weighs more than 150 pounds is categorised as freight.As a retailer, eCommerce shipping may help you receive inventory from your manufacturer or send products to fulfilment distributors or centres.Chapter 3: Best methods for shipping from china to the U.S.Cross-border ecommerce from china to the united states is a little known but highly beneficial niche.Unfortunately, most Chinese product suppliers lack the experience to make it work.Based on Nextsmartship extensive expertise, this chapter discusses the best shipping methods from China to the United States.Airfreight\nAirfreight is the fastest way to ship from china to the united states.It can also be costly.Freight rates vary between different forwarders, and the prices change regularly as well.For large shipment sizes and origin/destination pairs, ocean freight might be cheaper.Sea freight\nOcean freight is the most cost-effective strategy for packages that weigh more than half a ton.It guarantees excellent economies of scale, considering that some vessels are capable of carrying 20,000 20-foot containers).Some freight forwarding companies also offer expedited freight as a premium service.Similar to air shipping, ocean shipping rates vary among different forwarders, and they change over time.Shipping with Nextsmartship\nIf you choose to fulfil your orders with Nextsmartship, you’ll have all the choices to send directly to the united states.We’d like to talk about two of our logistics partners for shipping DTC packages here: China Post and DHL.China post\nChina post, officially the China Post Group Corporation, is a state-owned enterprise that operates China’s postal service except for its special administrative regions, which have independent postal services.China Post offers three shipping services:\nAirmail\nEUB (ePacket)\nRegistered mail.Benefits of china post\nShipping with.Epacket charges about $10 for each packet sent from china to the United States.Though shipping takes about 7 days, it is an ideal option if you’re looking to save money\nDisadvantages\nShipping through china post can be slow.Though clearance takes between 1-2 days, it may extend to half a month in peak seasons.Inadequate support: if you don’t have insurance for your merchandise, China post doesn’t issue compensation for lost or damaged packages.DHL\nDHL is an international shipping company with branches all across the world.It is fast and reliable\nAdvantages\nIf you need quick deliveries, DHL is the ideal solution for our brand.The company can deliver orders to the United States in as little as 3 Days\nExceptional service: if a package is lost, or its shipping fee is overstated, you qualify to get a full refund.Disadvantages\nDHL’s fees are about twice those charged by China Post.Furthermore, its shipping fees vary, and may suddenly change due to monthly fuel surcharges.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+VhnxnkFMfklwhvQFDg93B8bdT8959CTPL4DqRKQSyA="},"8198fbd0-787e-48ad-8066-6166726508a1":{"id_":"8198fbd0-787e-48ad-8066-6166726508a1","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55526847-6d5b-4f66-8dec-4cbada312086","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"GiayCjEM4RsmmFK8xpU20MdPlSKrOMbS+cl2vZltvlw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"be1d9796-9b3e-4031-a012-40186c39b9b7","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"6qtiwmqk5npsN9rlEWQiJ22dngrZtUm1EPL+uTL8rmU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"eace0fde-8eca-4837-9820-87ddba646662","metadata":{},"hash":"pQSwcbkFdmj73SM7irXvIa039Bsi0L51zDRQ12t1fwQ="}},"text":"Though

in the U.S.Vs. Shipping fulfilment in China.There are two basic approaches to order fulfilment: fulfilling orders from the United States, or from a fulfilment centre in China.This section examines both to help you choose the best option for your brand.Shipping fulfilment in the United States\nWhen you fulfil orders to US customers from fulfil centers in the United States, your orders are kept in a US-based fulfilment centre, so the entire order fulfilment process occurs within the country\nBenefits\nFast shipping: this is particularly advantageous during peak seasons like Black Friday.If your inventory is in the United States, you can make deliveries on the same day that the orders are made.Easy returns and restocking process: it’s easier for customers to return or exchange items they aren’t satisfied with.Increased efficiency will not only put you in their favour but also reduce losses and shipping costs.Convenient market expansion: if you’re selling on Amazon, the fact that your orders are fulfilled from a local warehouse will push you ahead of other sellers whose products are shipped from abroad.Disadvantages\nCost: overseas warehousing costs more than it does in China.If you don’t sell your inventory in about one month, storage costs will increase dramatically.Reduced flexibility: if your inventory is sensitive to quick fashion trends, it may be unwise to move inventory to the U.S., especially if you have a low turnaround rate.Shipping fulfilment in China\nFulfilling orders in china involves sending your inventory to a China fulfilment centre.With this option, sorting, inspection, picking and packing occur before items are shipped to the united states.Benefits\nInexpensive: the rate for shipping a single standard-size item is lower than it is for orders fulfilled in the united states.Reduced taxes: industrial goods whose value exceeds $800 pay a tariff rate of 2.0 upon entry into the united states.If you choose to fulfil your inventory in china, the tax won’t be applicable.Disadvantages\nVariable shipping time.Shipments are heavily affected by weather conditions, and any delay, even when it caused by bad weather, may not sit well with your customers.Which strategy is best for you?If you sell large items, it’s wise to use a fulfilment centre close to your customers.If you sell standard sized products and ship less than 300 orders each month, fulfilment from china is a better strategy.Chapter 5: Choosing a shipping policy\nShipping policy is a comprehensive document that outlines your shipping process.It covers all facets of your shipping operations and includes shipping locations, your policy for free shipping (if relevant), shipping options, costs, and so on.Your shipping policy helps customers understand the nature of your business, and it can serve as a valuable point of reference should any disputes arise.Why you need a shipping policy\nIncreased efficiency\nYour shipping policy will spare your enterprise lots of time and finances.If your customers don’t have enough information on how you handle shipping, they will likely overwhelm your support team with questions about delays, shipping costs, etc. A comprehensive guide on how you run your shipping will answer customers’ queries, saving you time and other resources.Cost savings\nShipping policy has a significant effect on sales.If, for instance, you offer international shipping, your business may be harder to manage, but it will expand to overseas markets and generate increased revenues.Conversely, local shipping may be easy to manage, but it will limit your growth potential to a single country.A clear shipping policy will keep your customers happy and satisfied and help you maximize your sales.Tips for an effective shipping policy\nPay close attention to detail.Unclear wording will force your customers to make assumptions, and you don’t want that to happen because it means you’re likely to disappoint.Be honest.If you know a particular delivery option takes about 3 days but may extend to 5, don’t say 3.Your customers expect you to be reliable.If you break their trust, it’ll be hard to win back.Be organized.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"BLDl2LAxkQsi/4yGn3ZIHRTDFDeVdcXbhuudaRG/wa4="},"eace0fde-8eca-4837-9820-87ddba646662":{"id_":"eace0fde-8eca-4837-9820-87ddba646662","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55526847-6d5b-4f66-8dec-4cbada312086","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"GiayCjEM4RsmmFK8xpU20MdPlSKrOMbS+cl2vZltvlw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8198fbd0-787e-48ad-8066-6166726508a1","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"YSKGF5NJl7OOtkBAEtLjwpknpOT14+EsYNBSZujeC0U="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a90f6ce5-34c0-49da-b8dc-5482bbfa878a","metadata":{},"hash":"Rw6BatJgMyM8wQ/YdiQsETo7s2BNUtwb895te7pfY1o="}},"text":"Cost

reliable.If you break their trust, it’ll be hard to win back.Be organized.Have an overview of your policy along with a detailed explanation for each section.Customers like to have information at their fingertips.Short summaries that list all the main points in your document will improve their experience.Chapter 6: Shipment tracking\nOrder tracking allows you to follow all your orders and shipments and to relay this information to the relevant parties at any time.It readily provides answers to questions such as order fulfillment dates, estimated delivery time, delivery addresses, and potential delays.Benefits\nConvenience\nWithout an order tracking system, you, the vendor, will have no choice but manually handle customer inquiries.This is a lot more expensive than order tracking, which automatically answers the most pertinent questions customers have on their minds.Customer satisfaction\nAutomated order tracking improves your brand image, positioning you as a reliable, trustworthy merchant.Customers like it when they receive updates on their orders.So, if you have an order management system, they are more likely to buy from you and leave you positive reviews.Ecommerce competition is incredibly fierce.Adding an eCommerce order tracking system will give you an advantage over your competition.Control over the order fulfillment process\nOrder tracking allows you to follow the status of all your orders and to anticipate problems before they occur.With the information from your system, you can quickly find solutions to problems and avoid customer disputes.Tips on setting up eCommerce fulfillment\nDedicated pages\nBefore you add any form of order tracking to your eCommerce store, you should create pages on your site for each step of the order tracking process.There should be pages for shipping, returns, orders, and confirmation.It also helps to have a printable receipt as this will help you establish legitimacy and trust with your customers.Email notifications\nEmail can deliver thank you messages, tracking numbers, and more.It is one of the most trusted and reliable forms of communication for millions of users worldwide.It gives customers a sense of privacy, control, and belonging, so it is an ideal channel for customer communications.Besides order tracking, emails can deliver product promotions, and newsletters, thus improving customer engagement.Chapter 7: How to reduce shipping costs\nShipping rates are a complex subject.With skyrocketing demand and volatile carrier fees, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for small business owners to maintain reasonable profit margins.The good news, however, is that there are ways around the problem.Use professional packaging\nPackaging is meant to protect your products during transit and improve the perception of your products.However, if it’s not done the right way, it will increase your shipping costs.How packaging affects shipping costs\nMany shipping companies use excessive amounts of protective packaging.While it is done with good intentions (to limit the risk of damage in transit) it can substantially affect your shipping fees.A few extra layers of bubble wrap may take your package from a gross weight of 1.1lb to 2lb, thereby increasing your cost.Hiring a professional packaging service will help you avoid this problem.Don’t waste space – choose the smallest possible packaging size for your product.Don’t use large boxes for small packages unless it is absolutely necessary.A cardboard box may not weigh much, but it will increase your package’s volumetric weight and potentially increase shipping costs.Reduce volumetric weight\nVolumetric weight is a shipping metric that combines a package’s weight and size.It presents density, volume, and weight as a single measurement that package handlers use to determine shipping prices.An item’s actual weight can significantly influence its shipping cost.For instance, a 1-kg gold brick is easy to store and transport.It doesn’t need special handling; it doesn’t also doesn’t take up much space and is sufficiently dense.On the other hand, a 1-kg painting may be 3 meters long.Though it’s the same weight as a gold brick, it requires a lot more effort to handle and store, and it will have a higher volumetric weight.Have multiple items packed into a single box.Items placed in a single package will take up less space (volume) than items packaged individually.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"96IG6NNGyxpFx4nSV4f/MaDERG4Gh2xi2gpZPCKJfRY="},"a90f6ce5-34c0-49da-b8dc-5482bbfa878a":{"id_":"a90f6ce5-34c0-49da-b8dc-5482bbfa878a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55526847-6d5b-4f66-8dec-4cbada312086","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"GiayCjEM4RsmmFK8xpU20MdPlSKrOMbS+cl2vZltvlw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"eace0fde-8eca-4837-9820-87ddba646662","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"pQSwcbkFdmj73SM7irXvIa039Bsi0L51zDRQ12t1fwQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a5a2a130-0ae5-4b1a-b5cc-6417152c97d0","metadata":{},"hash":"cc6yMPMkCkAWqrU+QvDPTN1buAMT81THYG+MYedAeKQ="}},"text":"A

multiple items packed into a single box.Items placed in a single package will take up less space (volume) than items packaged individually.Chapter 8: Why you need shipping insurance\nShipping insurance is a service that compensates customers whose orders are stolen, lost, or damaged in transit.Since there is always the chance something may go wrong, it’s wise to ensure your parcels as this will protect you from compensatory claims should something go amiss.Besides this, there are several other benefits:\nPeace of mind\nShipping insurance can offer peace of mind by eliminating any worries over lost, missing or damaged items.Since your insurance agent will handle compensation, there’s no need for concern if anything goes wrong.Reduced burden\nPackage insurance will streamline your operations and reduce the amount of paperwork you have to process.It will save you time, money, and other resources.Customer satisfaction\nShipping insurance offers customers greater satisfaction.In fact, they are more likely to purchase your products if they’re insured.Shipping insurance options\nUnited States Postal Service (USPS) shipping insurance\nUSPS insurance offers a standard insurance policy that protects your items against damage, loss, and missing content.The insurance will only cover the actual value of the shipped items.United Parcel Service (UPS) Insurance\nWith UPS insurance, the provider reimburses the full value of a lost or damaged item whether or not the shipper can prove that the carrier is liable.Note: UPS insurance does not cover loss resulting from improper packaging, prepaid letters, and acts of God such as adverse weather conditions and natural disasters.FedEx Insurance\nFedEx insurance provides standard declared value coverage.Consequently, each package’s liability is limited to USD 100 unless a higher value is declared and the subsequent fees paid.Fedex liability for delicate items and other items whose market value is hard to verify is limited to $1000, and you may not be allowed to declare a higher value for such items.Note: like UPS, FedEx insurance does not protect your parcels against acts of God, or packages damaged or lost after they arrive at the customer’s doorstep.Chapter 9: Shipping strategies that improve sales\nAccording to a study by the National Retail Federation, 66% of shoppers consider free shipping a vital aspect of their online experience.It stands to reason, therefore, that adding it to your marketing plan will greatly benefit your brand.Why you should offer free shipping\nBetter sales and revenues\nFree shipping will surely boost your sales and bring in new conversions.It has grown remarkably popular in the eCommerce world, and it will help you avoid the common customer perception that you are forcing them to pay for a service they would get free at large shopping platforms like amazon.Enhanced brand loyalty\nBesides attracting new customers, free shipping will help you win loyalty.Some studies have reported that over half of all consumers stay loyal to shops after they receive free shipping offers.This shows that it helps brands establish strong relationships with their customers, and increases the chances that they will become repeat buyers\nHigher order values\nShoppers are likely to buy more items than they need just to meet the minimum requirements for free shipping.Consequently, it is a strategy that can significantly improve your average order sizes.Tips on how to successfully offer free shipping\nHire a third-party fulfillment partner\nShipping can be a complex and challenging operation, more so if it involves overseas fulfilment.Fulfilment companies will help you reduce expenses and deliver products faster to your customers.Improve your packaging\nPackaging has a significant effect on the order cost.Improper packaging will increase the packages’ volumetric weights, thereby increasing your costs.Choose profitable free-shipping options\nDon’t be afraid to set conditions customers must meet before they qualify for free shipping.— for instance, you may set a minimum order value for free deliveries or offer free international shipping, provided that customers order high-value products.It may seem complicated and scary, but with the right strategy, free shipping will dramatically boost your sales, improve your profit margins and increase customer loyalty to your brand.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/H8oiDTwXxN9B5sSouOTeO/NZrg8yXWlwORy5JY5vqw="},"a5a2a130-0ae5-4b1a-b5cc-6417152c97d0":{"id_":"a5a2a130-0ae5-4b1a-b5cc-6417152c97d0","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55526847-6d5b-4f66-8dec-4cbada312086","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"GiayCjEM4RsmmFK8xpU20MdPlSKrOMbS+cl2vZltvlw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a90f6ce5-34c0-49da-b8dc-5482bbfa878a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.nextsmartship.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/"},"hash":"Rw6BatJgMyM8wQ/YdiQsETo7s2BNUtwb895te7pfY1o="}},"text":"Consequently,

transport, road or air, and like eCommerce shipping, it is an integral part of supply chain management.Freight shipping differs from e-commerce shipping in the sense that it’s for items that exceed 30in x 30in x 30 in or weigh more than 150 pounds.Benefits of freight shipping\nFreight shipping enables you to get your merchandise to its destination on time and at a relatively low cost.Whether it’s by road, air, rail, or sea, freight shipping confers several benefits.Carrier experience\nIf you need to transport heavy, high-value merchandise, then freight shipping is the ideal solution.It allows you to partner with professional carriers who can guarantee your cargo’s safety.Inexpensive rates\nFreight shipping offers economies of scale.Freight transporters maintain a highly specialized workforce so their employees will handle your merchandise with greater efficiency than an in-house team.Freight shipping methods\nLess than truckload\nMeant for shipments larger than parcels but too small to fill an entire truckload trailer, LTL shipping is suitable for consignments that weigh between 150 and 15,000 pounds.Full truckload\nFull truckloads are pallets large enough to require the use of semi-trailer, and they usually weigh larger than 15000pounds.Since the merchandise fills the entire trailer, they are relatively inexpensive, and there is little risk that cargo will be damaged in transit.Partial truckload\nPartial truckloads allow multiple shippers to split the cost of a single truck.They are a cost-efficient way to ship small consignments.Intermodal shipping\nThis approach typically combines two transport modes (rail and road), and may at times extend to three.It is fuel-efficient and reliable.Expedited freight\nExpedited freight is used for urgent shipments.It’s limited to road or air freight.Delivery times last between 24 hours and 3 days, depending on carrier policy.Conclusion\nEcommerce shipping can be a daunting task for any eCommerce brand.Each business will have specific challenges to tackle and overcome to optimise its shipping strategy.Like most aspects of building an eCommerce business, it will take time and careful evaluation to identify the best approach.Understanding all the aspects of your shipping strategy is critical to your long-term performance and profitability.For this reason, even when you feel you have understood everything, don’t rest.Revaluate your position at least twice a year to ensure you keep offering your customers the most competitive and convenient service.If you prefer a professional third-party logistics company’s support and expertise, Nextsmartship offers a range of custom solutions that will perfectly fit your brand.Regardless of the options you choose, you will have:\n100% Transparent Pricing\n9%
