But have you ever considered a 3PL partner, and what one can do for you?\\nBusiness owners often look to a 3PL to take on the day-to-day of their fulfilment. Working as an extra arm in their business plan, a 3PL offers expert insight and an array of exceptional knowledge into the business which can improve customer retention, and help you to excel in other aspects of the business.\\nWhat do I have to do? When working with a third-party-logistics partner you literally have to sit back, relax and let them take on the entire fulfilment process. Working with a 3PL means that an external fulfilment centre will tackle the day-to-day of any and all eCom fulfilment. From warehousing and storage to picking packing and shipping – you can spend your time focused on the business operations and less time providing an exceptional delivery experience… that bit’s on us.\\nWhat are the benefits of using a 3PL logistics partner?\\n 1. Take back your time...\\nTime is one of the biggest factors in most people’s lives. We have too little time to get the important bits done! That is where outsourcing to a 3PL partner comes in.\\nLeaving the day-to-day of it to an external company will help you focus on what really matters, whether that’s the core business elements or even that extra hour for your lunch break – take your time back with a 3PL.\\nAll too often in this industry, we hear drastic underestimations for the time it takes to pick, pack and ship their orders – and that’s not to mention the day-to-day of warehousing and stock management.\\nBy outsourcing your eCommerce fulfilment service, you can ensure timely delivery and free up more of your time to spend on what you do best – growing your business!\\n2. It’s more cost-effective in the long run\\nDecided to keep your eCommerce fulfilment in-house? That might be the best solution for you. However, if you do decide to try and manage your fulfilment services in-house you need to consider the following:\\nOption one: Do everything yourself.  Taking on your own fulfilment by yourself can be rewarding but it also takes a lot of time. As previously stated, we often drastically underestimate the amount of time that fulfilment takes, and as your business begins to grow and more orders come in – the more time that will take. Remember that old saying time is money, that’s never been truer than when it comes to fulfilment.\\nOption two: Hire a team to do it for you. Hiring a team to take on your fulfilment can be a great option, but this doesn’t come cheap! Recruitment, wages, storage, insurance everything you’ll have to pay on an ongoing basis, regardless of demand and seasonal fluctuations.\\nIf you choose to outsource the process instead, this is one thing that you won’t have to concern yourself with. You can cut costs, saving on leasing, staffing and insurance costs. There are costs associated with using a 3PL provider however finding the right 3PL partner is the first step in reducing costs and saving time.\\n3. Reduce shipping costs for clients\\nThere are lots of perks which come from using a 3PL partner, and one of those is reduced shipping costs! Sounds great right? Most fulfilment centres like ourselves have got a much greater shipping volume, allowing us to benefit from reduced rates using a selection of carriers. Not to mention that our warehouses are located at the heart of the UK, being so close to the M1 and East Midlands Airport help to keep shipping costs low and reduce shipping time to customers.\\nFor your customers, this can result in more attractive shipping options, including discounted rates and next-day delivery. When customers are happy they come back – resulting in an increase in revenue and retention rates.\\n4. Get access to the best technology\\nWhen fulfilment is what you do, you spend time, money and energy perfecting the entire fulfilment process. We invest heavily in the very best technology allowing us to increase efficiency and reduce delivery times. This process involves management & tracking systems, shipping management and using highly trained staff; we specialise in all things logistics – and when using a 3PL you have access to that same specialist knowledge.\\nHaving the very best technology at our disposal means that we keep you in the loop every step of the way. You have full visibility of every aspect of the process allowing you to live check stock availability, order status and more! Meaning that even though you’re outsourcing – you’re never that far away.\\n5. Expand into new marketplaces with ease\\nLooking to expand into new unchartered territories? Or thinking that might be a step you take in the future? A 3PL partner could be a key element to that transition.\\nWith the ability to easily ship your products all over the world a 3PL is your best friend when looking to expand globally.  Internationalisation in eCommerce is a massive consideration in today’s market and it can be costly and time-consuming to take this process in-house.\\nTurning to a 3PL for advice and assistance can help you to break through and tap into new flourishing markets – giving you a positive ROI!\\nSound good?
