this page on Pinterest\nSend this link in an email message\nLogistics management encompasses all that goes into the efficient movement and storage of goods and materials as they are transported through the supply chain — including the management of resources and people.Given the number of moving parts and uncertainties that can come with logistics, efficiency is key to supply chain success.There are various practices that can be put in place for more effective logistics management, including employee training and automation with technology.But you should also always be prepared to improvise in times of change or uncertainty.When your business witnesses growth, you must find ways to streamline logistics planning processes to improve output.Read on for our tips for managing logistics more effectively.Important Tips for Effective Logistics Management & Network Optimization\n1.Make a Plan, but Expect the Unexpected\nThe first step to accomplishing a task is planning.It encapsulates various factors and involves procuring the goods, storage facilities, and delivery of products to an exact location.But it also encompasses time, transportation, and costs.You’ll need to be able to devise a flow chart for the entire operation.The purpose of planning is to attain maximum work in the least possible time.At the same time, the planning should aim to maximize profits.Proper planning is wise, but an experienced manager will be able to prepare for unforeseen circumstances as well.These situations can be related to:\nProduct availability and quality\nAvailable shipping capacity or transportation options (or the lack thereof)\nInternal organizational issues, such as staffing shortages or pandemic protocols that may impact processes\nResearching and picking the correct freight class\nJust think of the supply chains around the world that have been disrupted since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.Businesses have been forced to adjust their supply chain planning on the fly.This is why logistics planning is incomplete without a contingency plan.At GlobalTranz, we help shippers plan for the unexpected and navigate changes as they arise.2.Adopt Automation and Embrace Supply Chain Technology\nIn the age of automation, technology plays a major role in increasing the efficiency of an organization.Adopting automation techniques will help you optimize your business processes.There is valuable software that can be deployed in the logistics process to do just that.For example, you can integrate business process software that provides timely updates regarding the movement of goods.You will get updates regarding:\nThe goods that are dispatched from the supplier\nProcurement of the goods at the warehouse\nDelivery of the goods at the destination\nThis saves a considerable amount of time because manual interference is eliminated.Moreover, accurate tracking helps improve overall process management.When choosing a logistics partner, be sure they have the technology in place to help you streamline your processes.GlobalTranz offers end-to-end transportation management technology that gives you everything from tracking capabilities to real-time analytics.3.Value Your People and Relationships\nYour team plays a major role in growing your business.That’s why you need to invest in a robust employee training program.Regular training workshops can keep employees updated with the latest trends in the logistics industry and new technology.A logistics manager with impeccable interpersonal skills is crucial for the organization.There are times when things don’t work according to the plan.In these situations, instead of panicking, you need a reliable person who can sort out the issues with the utmost efficiency.That manager should also have authoritative contacts in the industry, which will be beneficial in exploring new business opportunities.Give your employees the resources they need to join industry groups and attend events where they can grow their network of potential business partners.In addition to the people you hire, it’s important to prioritize the relationship between your employees and your third-party logistics (3PL) partner.Open dialogue and clear communication will go a long way in ensuring a successful logistics management program.4.Prioritize Warehouse Management\nEffective logistics management is incomplete without proper warehouse management.Warehouse operations can vary greatly depending on the type of goods you produce, store and distribute.For example, perishable goods like dairy products need refrigeration facilities, while grains should be stored in a moisture-free environment.And if your goods are not moved quickly enough, it can result in wasted product and lost revenue.Implementing a real-time inventory management tool will help you reduce the cost of maintaining inventory.Moreover, maximize the storage capacity of your warehouses.Vertical storage columns are often recommended to get the most storage out of your space.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8Tat+Ge6e922MW1ko8Yx09ui+3VHcqRC2qw6qbS4zwY="},"0cd9ffca-b8d3-4f54-a3f5-a3be6cb69848":{"id_":"0cd9ffca-b8d3-4f54-a3f5-a3be6cb69848","metadata":{"url":"https://www.globaltranz.com/resource-hub/logistics-management-tips/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0309614f-f4a1-4bd1-b032-6fa2927d94e9","metadata":{"url":"https://www.globaltranz.com/resource-hub/logistics-management-tips/"},"hash":"FNN88oz8BH0Jz9TbcqXdiKvT8GIr6t9Ynlb+AhYWw5c="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"690766ef-6730-4113-a413-393d01a7c55a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.globaltranz.com/resource-hub/logistics-management-tips/"},"hash":"8Tat+Ge6e922MW1ko8Yx09ui+3VHcqRC2qw6qbS4zwY="}},"text":"Give

software for sequencing the products so that there is no delay while locating the product once an order is placed.When choosing a partner, look for someone who can help you prioritize warehouse management and stays on top of warehouse management trends.GlobalTranz is not just a logistics partner.We have expertise to help you with warehousing, fulfillment, and transportation.5.Efficiently Transport Your Products\nGetting your products in the hands of your customers is key to your overall success.That’s why you should focus on building out an efficient transportation strategy.When it comes to moving your products, you should prioritize factors such as fast delivery, cost savings, and overall efficiency.Here’s what you should consider for efficient transportation:\nLook at both time and safety when determining the most cost-effective delivery route\nOpt for cost-effective packaging that balances both low investment and high safety for goods\nOptimize the packaging so that it occupies less volume and does not increase the weight of the package\nPick the mode that is right for each individual load, whether its full truckload, less-than-truckload, intermodal, or other\nYour third-party logistics provider can help with all of this — and more.Your provider should be a partner, guiding you to make the best decisions for your transportation strategy.Choosing the right mode, finding the best carrier at the best price, tracking the movements of your loads, and collecting valuable data are all things a good partner can help with.6.Put Data and Expertise to Work for Your Logistics Management Strategy\nLogistics network optimization is incomplete without integrating measurement, analysis, and feedback.When you deploy new strategies in the system, you need to measure the output.This is important as it implies the success or failure of the strategy.Aim to integrate measurement tools and software that easily determine and classify the data.The insights you get from these tools will help you make data-driven decisions for your future planning.Analyze the metrics related to different operations, including:\nCycle time metrics\nCost metrics\nService metrics\nBut data doesn’t tell us everything.Industry knowledge and years of experience is also crucial.Create an environment that encourages feedback and ideas from your employees.You should also keep this in mind when choosing a logistics partner.A dense carrier network and best-in-class technology are important, but the people making it all happen are where the true value lies.Improve Your Logistics Management With Help From a 3PL\nThe aim of effective logistics management is to improve the efficiency of your operations, ensuring customer satisfaction and increased productivity.Adopting technology, valuing people and their experience, and taking an innovative approach to logistics management will help you succeed over the competition.But you don’t have to do any of it alone —

this link in an email message\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) are essential to maintaining a successful logistics operations.They connect data and metricsto show if your operations perform as expected and highlight what strengths or weaknesses may exist.But deciding which logistics KPIs to track isn't always straightforward.Many logistics organizations have different goals — whether to reduce shipping costs or improve service performance.But goals may change over time, so the logistics KPIs you choose to track often are a moving target.Using a Scorecard to Monitor Logistics Metrics and KPIs\nAt GlobalTranz, we believe in taking a personalized approach to measuring and tracking performance.To do that, we work with shippers to identify goals and create a logistics scorecard that will help monitor success and detect areas for improvement.This scorecard is a report used to show performance across a number of categories, often compared against industry benchmarks.Our transportation management system (TMS) is organized to make sure it is collecting the data you need in easy-to-use dashboards, while our team of experts turn that data into actionable insights.Below, we've included some of the most common goals we see in the industry and paired them with the core logistics KPIs that GlobalTranz can help you track so you can reach your goals.Goal 1: Reduce overall shipping costs\nLogistics managers are often tasked to reduce overall shipping costs.But there are a number of variables and related strategies you can implement, including bringing on a transportation management system.To know which strategy is right for you, you must first understand your overall freight spend.It will include operational costs, packing, shipping, employee pay, TMS fees, fleet maintenance and other fees related to the transporting of freight.Additionally, there are KPIs that help prove the value of a TMS as well as identify other methods for reducing your costs.GlobalTranz will work with you to evaluate your logistics program and identify the KPIs that will help you meet your goal to reduce costs.Freight cost indicator KPIs\nCost for each unit shipped\nOutbound freight costs compared to total sales\nInbound freight costs compared to purchases\nAccessorial compared to total freight costs\nTMS cost per unit\nTMS cost versus cost avoidance\nYear over year cost increases as a percent of total revenue\nQuote to invoice accuracy\nAverage cost per skid or order\nGoal 2: Manage freight rates\nTo get the full picture of your logistics costs, it's important to properly manage and track your freight specific rates.These freight rate management KPIs should be part of your logistics scorecard.GlobalTranz makes managing freight rates easier by including these necessary KPIs in our analysis of your program.Freight cost management KPIs\nFuel efficiency rate\nDetention and delays\nAverage transportation cost per mile\nAccessorials as percentage of freight\nPerfect order percentage\nGoal 3: Improve service performance for your logistics operations\nEnsuring quality service performance will have positive ripple effects and can help you meet other goals including improving customer experience and satisfaction.Service performance KPIs are the standard for logistics managers looking to measure the success of their operations.At GlobalTranz, we can help you not only track these metrics, but put them to use to identify areas of improvement and create action plans for your logistics operations.Service performance KPIs\nLabor productivity\nOn-time pickup and delivery\nDelivery on-time-in-full (OTIF)\nDamage rate or cargo loss\nClaims percentage for freight costs\nAverage loading and unloading times\nAverage dwell time\nPlanned time in transit vs. actual\nRevenue yield by specific units\nGoal 4: Manage carrier and inbound vendor compliance\nCarrier and inbound vendor compliance programs can go a long way in helping reduce shipping costs and reduce the risk of supply chain discrepancies.Poor compliance puts your business at risk of financial repercussions, delayed shipments, damaged freight, and more.GlobalTranz can help ensure you are tracking the right metrics and hitting your goals when it comes to compliance.Some factors we include in our tracking are unsafe driving, hours of service (HOS), vehicle maintenance, driver fitness, hazardous materials compliance, ELD compliance and more.By enforcing carrier compliance KPIs, our customers can have some control over carrier performance.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"3i4Boz8YAvPS7FFh4ShaZf+manhd7MjtzSjlfMJ9Flo="},"ba5830c8-1f7a-4a1e-b43b-096e46abc61d":{"id_":"ba5830c8-1f7a-4a1e-b43b-096e46abc61d","metadata":{"url":"https://www.globaltranz.com/resource-hub/logistics-kpis-you-should-be-tracking/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e126ff8e-c8e6-455a-b93e-ed62900312cb","metadata":{"url":"https://www.globaltranz.com/resource-hub/logistics-kpis-you-should-be-tracking/"},"hash":"TmpcIvcZk513WOwSCm4UArVBoHECK29VV/LmP4awN7M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"23725354-3682-49fb-b653-c0e6972da8ce","metadata":{"url":"https://www.globaltranz.com/resource-hub/logistics-kpis-you-should-be-tracking/"},"hash":"3i4Boz8YAvPS7FFh4ShaZf+manhd7MjtzSjlfMJ9Flo="}},"text":"Service

Pinterest\nSend this link in an email message\nFAQ: Third-Party Logistics Services & 3PLs\nWhat role do 3PLs play in the greater logistics industry?Logistics and transportation operations are an essential part of the supply chain process.A third-party logistics provider (known as a 3PL), is an outsourced company that helps businesses manage their logistics processes to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the costs involved with the transportation of goods.They can specialize in everything that is needed for the efficient movement and storage of goods and materials as they are transported through the supply chain.Outsourcing is a great solution for companies as their supply chains grow and they require assistance to manage logistics processes — no matter how big those companies are in size.Most 3PLs are non-asset based.This means they do not own trucks but rather provide the expertise, technology and industry relationships to connect shippers with carriers and other supply chain partners.What logistics services and modes do 3PLs offer?A 3PL can offer a variety of logistics services, including warehousing, inventory management, picking and packing, transportation management, reverse logistics and even an RMA process strategy .Some 3PLs offer managed transportation solutions, providing extended involvement and responsibility over strategic and executional functions.This can range from a partial or complete outsource of your supply chain management needs.Some logistics services and modes of transportation offered by 3PLs include:\nTruckload management\nLess-than-truckload\nRail/intermodal\nExpedited shipping\nManaged transportation\nSupply chain management\nTechnology integration\nWarehouse and inventory management\nFreight forwarding\nWhat are the benefits of working with a 3PL as your third-party logistics solution?Cost savings and scalability are two of the main reasons shippers choose to begin working with a 3PL.But there are several other benefits of bringing on a third-party logistics partner that allow you to:\n Tap into an existing carrier network, gaining access to thousands of carriers to support your freight volumes and capacity needs without the added stress of sourcing, qualifying and managing carriers.Gain access to state-of-the-art logistics technology for deeper insights into your shipping data while adding the convenience of route optimization and carrier selection.Leverage the experience and expertise of the team members at your 3PL, who should act as an extension of your own team.At the end of the day, a 3PL is a partner who can help you create and execute a best-in-class logistics strategy.How can 3PLs help shippers reduce costs?There are many ways a third-party logistics provider can help you reduce shipping costs.3PLs work with multiple shippers, which means they are moving a high volume of freight.They leverage this to secure the best rates from carriers.Working with a 3PL allows you to limit overhead in departments such as transportation, billing, IT, hiring and training.As your business grows, you don't need to hire new people to scale with it.Additionally, a 3PL can help create a strategy that streamlines processes and integrates the most cost-effective shipping methods for your freight.Advanced technology also allows shippers to avoid the added costs associated with purchasing and implementing their own transportation management system (TMS) for delivery and tracking functionality.What industry certifications are important for 3PLs to hold?Third-party logistics providers can hold several different logistics industry certifications.Depending on their specialties and the logistics services they offer, 3PLs may be certified for food storage, transporting hazardous materials or cross-border transportation, to name a few.Some certifications are given to the company, while others are obtained by individual employees.The Transportation Intermediary Association (TIA) offers the Certified Transportation Broker (CTB) program.This is a widely recognized certification that requires employees to prove competencies in three categories: brokerage basics and basic business skills; contracts and pricing; and regulatory environment and legal issues.How can my business implement a 3PL?It is important to identify your needs and set goals prior to choosing a logistics partner.Successful partnerships are built on trust and alignment of core values.A 3PL, for example, should value their employees as much as you value

on Twitter\nPin this page on Pinterest\nSend this link in an email message\nRetail product returns can make a big impact on your bottom line.In fact, these returns account for an estimated $165 million in losses per $1 billion in sales.1 Without a proper reverse logistics strategy, your business could lose out on profits simply for not being prepared.But don't worry — leading third-party logistics providers have the tools, resources and support you need to create an ideal reverse logistics strategy.In this article, we'll walk you through the basics of reverse logistics and seven steps you'll need to follow to create your own reverse logistics strategy.An Overview of Reverse Logistics Management\nReverse logistics encompasses any reuptake, recycling, refurbishing and redistribution of goods.From the intake of returned items to the repurposing or reintroducing of those goods back into the marketplace, a solid reverse logistics management strategy can help your business maximize the value of returned products regardless of their condition.Reverse logistics encompasses:\nReturn shipping of products\nProduct recalls\nReselling of returned items\nRepairing or refurbishing items\nRemanufacturing items to reuse the raw materials\nRecycling products that cannot be reused\nWhat do reverse logistics providers offer?Leading reverse logistics providers offer a comprehensive view and holistic approach to supply chain optimization.From the intake of raw materials to the distribution of returned goods back into the marketplace, a quality reverse logistics provider will help you with:\nScalability and flexibility within your supply chain\nDeep industry and geographical knowledge and expertise\nTransparency into the entire product life cycle\nDistribution and refurbishment center management\nData integration and web-based technology\nHow will 3PL reverse logistics help my business?Reverse logistics management from a trusted 3PL can transform the way your business operates.Optimizing your reverse supply chain can help you save money, improve operations, and so much more.Benefits of 3PL reverse logistics management include:\nReduced administrative, transportation and aftermarket support costs\nIncreased efficiency\nIncreased service market share\nHigher achievement of sustainability goals\nGreater customer service and higher retention levels\nA synchronized supply chain to include forward logistics, inbound logistics, and reverse logistics\nTransparency in supply chain operations across your network\nAutomatic consolidation of data from partners and systems\n7 Steps to Implement a Reverse Logistics Process and How a 3PL Can Help\nLooking to implement a reverse logistics process?Follow these steps to create a solid strategy.And make sure to partner with a reverse supply chain expert to ensure that your supply chain optimization efforts are as efficient as possible.1.Develop and communicate a returns policy.A reverse logistics process always starts with a clearly communicated returns policy.Returns happen, there's no way around it.Set yourself up for success by crafting and putting into place a clear-cut process for returns.Then make sure that your process is clearly stated on your website or by your sales representatives.Your customers should be in the loop in order to streamline the process and avoid any potentially upset clientele.2.Collect and analyze returns data.After you've implemented your new returns process, it's imperative to start collecting and analyzing data so that you both have an idea of where your profit benchmarks should be and also inform your future decisions to maximize efficiency.Make sure to collect and compile all data points so that you can effectively audit your process and continuously improve your supply chain.3.Create an area for handling returns.One quick way to optimize your reverse logistics process is to section off a specific area to handle all returns.Not only will you save time when processing returns, but you will also save yourself and your employees energy by having all returns in one centralized location.No room to designate a set returns area?No problem!Certain 3PLs offer warehousing solutions to help you make the most of your space.4.Set up inbound shipping logistics for transporting products for returns, refurbishing and other reverse logistics tasks.Once you have a returns plan in action, complete with data recording and a designated work area, you'll want to take a look at how your returns make their way back to you and plan for what will happen to them once they arrive.Working with a 3PL reverse logistics expert can help you find the best prices and services to fit your unique needs and help you maximize your reverse supply chain processes.5.Establish a working process.Determining what happens to your returns can make or break your reverse logistics efficiency.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6WOhn/kmuyMDUflFpv7NHKUrNERQ5XIsyd3brrMNhjE="},"0cb7829d-37ee-4f9c-a8a9-66f74d0c3298":{"id_":"0cb7829d-37ee-4f9c-a8a9-66f74d0c3298","metadata":{"url":"https://www.globaltranz.com/resource-hub/reverse-logistics-process/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"7c35b03e-a300-4b49-9226-2202171d819f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.globaltranz.com/resource-hub/reverse-logistics-process/"},"hash":"lskmiBjbNRuY12D0grP0epkiCnV6qK8rB7zPyQzP5tg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"03c64a7f-55df-49a4-9011-4ad4365b193c","metadata":{"url":"https://www.globaltranz.com/resource-hub/reverse-logistics-process/"},"hash":"6WOhn/kmuyMDUflFpv7NHKUrNERQ5XIsyd3brrMNhjE="}},"text":"Not

with a low profit margin can leave you with unnecessary losses.Work with a trusted 3PL partner to decide what criteria each return must match to be resold, refurbished or recycled.Then create a process to follow through.6.Determine next steps based on product usability.Once you've decided which returned product goes where, you'll need to create a process to determine how goods are resold, refurbished or recycled.Consider your unique needs and limitations.There is no one-size-fits-all process, so be sure to work with an industry professional to ensure that you're making the most of your own capabilities.7.Implement the steps to complete a successful returns process.Now that you've created a solid returns strategy, it's time to put your optimized reverse logistics process into action.Remember that optimization is not a one-time occurrence.Continue collecting data and revamping your process to fit your needs as you scale and grow.A 3PL can also help implement the reverse logistics strategy to ensure all steps are working properly\nGet Best-in-Class Supply Chain Optimization from GlobalTranz\nHaving an effective reverse logistics process in place can help companies

transportation management and supply chain solutions. They leverage innovative technology to enhance logistics efficiency and visibility.\nIn order to work with GlobalTranz Enterprises, completing a carrier setup is the first step. Each broker has their own process. Here’s a how-to guide to get the carrier setup started with GlobalTranz Enterprises.\nBroker Requirements\nBrokers can change their requirements from time to time. This is the information that is provided by the broker at the time of this writing:\nCRITERIA\nREQUIREMENT\nAuthority Age (days)\nMinimum Insurance\nAuto Liability of $1,000,000 or greater\nCargo Liability of $100,000 or greater\nOther Authority Requirements\nHazmat Certificate (if certified)\nOther Certifications, such as CARB, SmartWay, UIIA (if applicable)\nDocuments Needed for Carrier Setup\nBrokers can change their requirements from time to time. This is the information that is provided by the broker at the time of this writing: \nCRITERIA\nREQUIREMENT\nW9\nMust be complete and accurate.\nCOI (Certificate of Insurance)\nMake sure lines of coverage are active.\nThe expiration date is after today.\nThere is an insurance contact in the top right (if using an Accord format).\nCOA (Certificate of Authority)\nMany brokers will require you to upload this document.\nYou will also need to know your authority age and Interstate or Intrastate.\nNOA (Notice of Assignment)\nMust have effective date.\nMust include the payee bank information (your factoring company if you have one, or your companies bank account information).\nEquipment\nNumber of tractors.\nNumber of trailers and the type/size of your trailers\nCarrier Setup Link\nEach broker setup has a unique URL. Some will have a public facing URL and others will require a private invitation code in order to access a unique setup link.\nHere is the link information for GlobalTranz Enterprises:\nhttps://globaltranzcarriers.rmissecure.com/_s/reg/GeneralRequirementsV2.aspx\nSystem Setup\nThis carrier onboarding process is done on RMIS.\nTruckstop's RMIS, short for Registry Monitoring Insurance Services, is a well-known compliance solution for the transportation industry. RMIS offers brokers a comprehensive carrier onboarding solution.\nCarriers who onboard with brokers through RMIS have one universal log-in to RMIS that can be used with all brokers. However, there is a unique URL for each broker's carrier registration page. Additionally, if you have your W9 and insurance on file with RMIS, then that same information can be used, along with any other profile information previously inputted, across all setups on RMIS.\nSome carrier onboarding processes on RMIS require an invitation code from the broker.\nAdditional Insured\nIf you have previously done carrier onboarding with another broker using RMIS, then your insurance information should be on file already with RMIS. Otherwise, you may be requested to add RMIS as the additional insured on your carrier's policy as follows:\nRegistry Monitoring Insurance Services, Inc.\n5388 Sterling Center Drive\nWestlake Village, CA 91361\nMost brokers will use the certificate with additional insured from RMIS. However, review the carrier onboarding process for any exceptions.\n‍\nNeed more help?\nGetting setup with a broker can be a lot of work.
