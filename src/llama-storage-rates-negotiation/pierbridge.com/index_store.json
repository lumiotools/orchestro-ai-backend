2020\nShare\n      *UPDATE: Since first publishing this article a little more than a year ago, much has changed in shipping and logistics, including some new costs.Carriers are limiting shipments as they are overrun with demand from increased online shopping.Most recently, carriers have announced rate increases for deliveries to residential addresses in the wake of the stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 crisis.However, while some new and ongoing charges are unavoidable, there are others that can be mitigated, if not totally avoided.We thought a trip back to one of our earlier blogs could shed some light on ways to cut your shipping costs during the coronavirus crisis and beyond.In the old days, it used to be pretty simple to calculate rates.Weigh a package, look up a zone on a zip to zone chart, and then find the cost of shipping associated with the weight and destination zone.Not anymore.Calculating shipping costs has become a lot more complicated, especially with the explosion of new carrier services, dynamic pricing incentives, and of course, surcharges.Reconciling expected costs against actual invoice charges amounts to a game of \"truth or dare.\"With shipping costs increasing at twice the rate of inflation, shippers need to ship smarter and implement cost controls to ensure they are not paying more than they need to.And it’s not just shippers who struggle with cost calculations.Carriers live in a hyper-competitive world where everyone in the supply chain expects new value-added services faster and on time.It is no wonder the freight auditing business has become a virtual cottage industry.In the midst of increased complexity, it is easy for carriers to make mistakes when they assemble invoices for shipments whizzing through their hubs.Here are 5 areas that are worth investigating to minimize overpayment:\n1.Smart Routing: How are your employees choosing among the many delivery options carriers are now offering?Do they select next- or second-day services when a standard ground service will get it there at the same time?Do they know whether there will be a residential or beyond area surcharge applied by the carrier?If you are choosing services based on the carrier’s published delivery schedule (or worse, the name of their service), then you are probably wasting a lot of money.You need to implement a routing process that selects carrier services based on an analysis of historical delivery performance to destination zip codes.A multi-carrier management system with analytics capabilities can provide those kinds of actionable insights and then enforce smart routing decisions by automatically “downgrading” service selections without impacting customer delivery expectations.2.Lean Packaging: eCommerce is driving demand and the supply of truck capacity is tight.Carriers want to “cube out” their vehicles to maximize their return on their capital investments.If you waste space, you undermine their profitability.We have written extensively about how parcel and freight carriers are casting a wider net in the application of dimensional weight rating.This means it is more likely than ever you pay more for shipments if you don’t pack with transportation costs in mind (which OMS and WMS systems generally don’t).Rather than having your fulfillment personnel guess about how to pack orders, you should think about implementing a process to algorithmically calculate the most transportation cost-effective way of packing and palletizing, based on SKU dimensions, weight, available container sizes, and other business rules.This will immediately reduce dimensional weight (DIM) fees and minimum container fees, while minimizing wasted fill material your customer will have to dispose of.Business rules, such as fill %, fragility, and don’t pack with, can greatly reduce damage claims.3.Carrier Performance: Lots to consider here.The obvious thing to look at is guaranteed delivery refunds, but many carriers have suspended these refunds during the COVID-19 crisis due to the uncertainty of delivery times.Still, if you want to hold your carriers accountable for living up to your delivery promise to customers, it is important to monitor delivery performance to get what you pay for but also to make more realistic estimates for last-mile deliveries.Capturing data about carriers’ actual delivery performance is also the key to feeding your smart routing processes.As noted above, the other consideration is damage.Shawn Shaw, CEO of GTMS, observed that, “90 percent of the time damages go unclaimed due to the lengthy process shippers have to go through to get reimbursed.This despite the fact that shippers have to pay notoriously high carrier insurance premiums.”Multi-carrier management systems that integrate carrier invoice auditing processes can both monitor damage and measure how fast a carrier responds to claims.4.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2s1VbV6CK8yB/oxbC47AH7mDSx5pxoKDpjquHTM0Ndw="},"e7a90c34-b7a9-4e7b-a5e2-ce5484b67a4a":{"id_":"e7a90c34-b7a9-4e7b-a5e2-ce5484b67a4a","metadata":{"url":"https://pierbridge.com/news/top-5-areas-you-should-look-at-to-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ea575f44-8ab9-47af-8ad1-962e0d6ba5b0","metadata":{"url":"https://pierbridge.com/news/top-5-areas-you-should-look-at-to-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"r9v2gShJyfIt0Tc/i3yWrZ+Q+VKwhZRtR4Y/CmvZsrw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7fd0e9e1-9e51-4ab2-b9cb-f9ce4b5f16e5","metadata":{"url":"https://pierbridge.com/news/top-5-areas-you-should-look-at-to-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"2s1VbV6CK8yB/oxbC47AH7mDSx5pxoKDpjquHTM0Ndw="}},"text":"3.Carrier

how fast a carrier responds to claims.4.Address Hygiene: Shippers are often unpleasantly surprised to find a significant gap between what they expected to pay for a shipment and what they were actually invoiced by the carrier.A lot of times it comes down to shippers failing to monitor addresses for correctness, completeness, or whether they are shipping to a residence or an extended delivery area.When carriers are charging $16+ to correct an address and tacking on $3+ for a delivery to a home outside of a standard delivery area, it behooves you to put automated processes in place to automatically monitor and correct addresses.5.Rate Optimization: It’s a well-established fact that every shipper in the civilized world has negotiated the very best rates possible.Just ask them.How do they know?Their carrier reps told them!You can expect to be on the losing end of a negotiation because carriers negotiate contracts every day and you might do it every couple of years.Optimizing your rates starts with the data you capture both at point of shipping and from carrier invoices.Using analytics and outside expertise from consultants who can benchmark your rates and find ways to optimize your transportation spend is fundamental to improving delivery while reducing costs.6.Plan for the Future [Update Bonus]\nThe boost in parcel shipping isn’t about to end once the pandemic subsides.A Commerce Hub survey intended to gauge consumer confidence and identify changing shopping patterns amidst COVID-19 disruptions, found that 69 percent of those surveyed would be more willing to subscribe to a delivery service for essential items following the COVID-19 pandemic, up from 43 percent that shopped online prior.Combined with rate increases from major carriers during the pandemic that may or may not be permanent, it is vital to manage your omnichannel, multi-carrier shipping.Having the right technology in place, such as Transtream multi-carrier management solution, can help your organization manage shipping costs during and after the coronavirus pandemic.News\nThe blurring line between Parcel and Freight in final-mile delivery\nThe best final-mile lessons from

At least not for shippers. For them, it’s about carefully managing transportation costs at all points in the order delivery cycle.\nEven as parcel demand continues to push shipping costs up at twice the rate of inflation, consumers increasingly expect free shipping, as well as fast and on-time delivery. For eCommerce players, costs are measured in shopping cart abandonment, customer attrition, and margins. By using multi-carrier shipping APIs across the enterprise, merchants can realize the best of both worlds: customer loyalty and reduced costs.\nThe average global cart abandonment rate for all industries in Q3 of 2018 was 76.9 percent, with retail coming in 75.8 percent, according to SaleCycle, which specializes in helping retailers recover lost sales. Furthermore, according to a study by Baymard Institute, an independent web usability research institute, a whopping 55 percent of people said they abandoned their carts due to extra costs including shipping.\nIncreasingly, operations and IT managers are working together to incorporate the use of multi-carrier shipping APIs to automate transportation cost control processes within their enterprise systems.\nHere are the five best use cases that management should consider when investing in multi-carrier shipping APIs integration development:\n1. Order Management Systems: Shoppers want to know cost and delivery options early on in the checkout process. Order management and eCommerce platforms can programmatically call APIs to rate shop carrier costs and delivery times. APIs with cartonization algorithms will instantly and precisely determine the most transportation cost-effective packing, taking into account SKU weight and dimensions, business rules, as well as available carton sizes and carrier services.\n2. Warehouse Management Systems: It comes as a surprise to many that most WMS systems do not take transportation cost into account when determining the best way to pack or palletize orders. Pierbridge’s Transtream API can take the guesswork out of the process by instantly calculating the best way to fulfill an order, saving time and shipping costs while reducing waste.\n3. Ship from Store and Supplier Portals: Shippers are trying to ship from inventory locations closest to their customers to reduce shipping costs and speed up delivery. Others are seeking to provide an endless aisle of inventory by shipping from suppliers. In either case, look for APIs that can determine shipping costs for multiple carriers from any ship from location, while automating packing instructions, label printing, and pickup requests.\n4. Customer Service Management: Multi-carrier tracking APIs can provide customers with proactive updates on delivery times and, more importantly, any exceptions to a shipper’s delivery promise. Augment APIs by embedding widgets in your customer service website to automate self-help order tracking.\n5. Returns Management: Shippers are using APIs to automate returns processing. A self-help returns process that lets customers print their own return labels (routed to the appropriate disposition center) from your website is convenient for customers and provides the perfect opportunity for upselling and SEO optimization.\nAPIs can have an impact on costs and customer experience throughout the order lifecycle. Make sure your developers are satisfied with ease of implementation, documentation, and support of shipping APIs. There is a real benefit to working with the right technology partner that can help you access all the carrier services you need.\nHaving the right tool for the job, and in this case, the right shipping API, can help shippers streamline operations and cut costs. And, having the best technology partner for shipping APIs can make the process smoother.

Destination\nDate\nJune 5, 2018\nShare\n      Cartonization algorithms can reduce unexpected DIM fees and waste, but did you know that they can help you find the cheapest way to pack an order for whatever carrier zone you’re sending your shipment?You know the score: eCommerce volumes have created a capacity crunch for parcel and LTL carriers.They have responded by expanding dimensional-based (DIM) rating policies, which penalize shippers who waste space on their trucks by packing orders into cartons that are too large relative to the weight of the contained items.The result?Unexpected DIM fees on carrier invoices.Luckily, there is new cartonization technology that can help reduce shipping costs and eliminate waste.That’s good.That’s smart.As we’ve written before, cartonization technology can help determine the most transportation-cost-effective way to pack SKUs into a carton, or cartons on a pallet, reducing DIM weight surcharges and wasted packing material.WMS and OMS systems do not take transportation costs into account when assigning pick/pack tasks.Cartonization can help.But here’s a benefit you probably don’t know about— a smart cartonization engine will actually tell you to pack differently based on where you’re sending a shipment.Highway to the DIM Zone\nYou may or may not know that sometimes the cheapest way of packing an order may differ depending on which carrier you use.Each carrier rate table scales differently by cost per carton, zone, and pounds, requiring unique optimal packing configurations.However, many shippers we talk to don’t realize there is an additional complex dynamic, specifically in relation to the carrier zones.Packing an order for Zone 2, for example, may not be the most transportation-cost-effective way to pack the same order for Zone 9.There is a “packing bias” built into the carrier rate tables for different zones, or distances.“Wait.What?”Yup.To explain, we’ll take an imaginary order being sent through FedEx.Zone 2 has a relatively high minimum carton charge (list price around $15), but relatively small price increases per pound (25 cents/lb.or 1 percent).In other words, as soon as you grab a box you know you will be paying ~$15, and every pound you add to your shipment, over 1 pound, will add 25 cents to the cost.But compare this with the same order shipped to Zone 9, where there is a relatively low minimum box charge ($65), but higher relative per pound increases ($3/lb or 4 percent).Therefore, adding more weight to your shipment is relatively more expensive as a percentage of your base box cost, than in Zone 2.This means that FedEx has different packing biases for each zone.In Zone 2, because the carrier is putting a smaller penalty on adding more weight to a box, but a higher penalty on using multiple boxes, it is revealing a bias that it would rather have you condense your items into fewer (and perhaps larger) cartons.We can take a guess why: presumably fewer and/or smaller boxes are easier for FedEx employees to process and transport.However, in FedEx Zone 9, those biases are reversed; it’s relatively more expensive for every additional pound you add to a box, yet cheaper to use multiple boxes.This may come down to FedEx’s bias for efficiency.If your goods are going to Hawaii, chances are they will be loaded onto a plane at some point, where volumetric space is more of a factor.The carrier wants to give you more wiggle room to use every inch of space in your boxes, which might mean using more boxes, packed more efficiently.Now, a good cartonization algorithm will look at our imaginary order, and the rate tables, and try to pack things the way FedEx wants.For this order in Zone 2, it would calculate one large and one small box, which represents the incentive (fewest boxes and then the smallest additional box if needed), even if in this case there’s some extra room in one of the boxes and it incurs a small DIM fee.Our result: 73 lbs (dimmed) and a $29.23 charge.However, if this order were shipped to Zone 9, where efficiency is king, the algorithm might correctly calculate two medium-sized boxes to minimize wasted space.Zone 9 rates penalize DIM rated as well as very full cartons, more than in Zone 2.Our result: 67 lbs and a $225.58 charge.Don’t believe us?","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dXQqmWjtayFd4jkCAMeYhN+MWx7NNrm4m78IaD0fYkQ="},"d820e4de-682e-4d26-a307-d59003b03389":{"id_":"d820e4de-682e-4d26-a307-d59003b03389","metadata":{"url":"https://pierbridge.com/news/to-minimize-shipping-costs-your-packing-strategy-needs-to-consider-destination/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"cc9a1c5c-5d68-43a9-a885-5b197cf74b19","metadata":{"url":"https://pierbridge.com/news/to-minimize-shipping-costs-your-packing-strategy-needs-to-consider-destination/"},"hash":"eWj2EaLcp4EcPnnBMJmssrfDauU5BPaCRfiyqmaOskU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"412e709e-3dbe-48e9-8586-a659a2b60c69","metadata":{"url":"https://pierbridge.com/news/to-minimize-shipping-costs-your-packing-strategy-needs-to-consider-destination/"},"hash":"dXQqmWjtayFd4jkCAMeYhN+MWx7NNrm4m78IaD0fYkQ="}},"text":"Now,

a whopping $13.06.Get started\nCartonization is complicated and there are no easy rules to follow.If you want to reduce the cost of free shipping, you’ll need technology that can handle the complexities of zone-based rating by looking at your negotiated rate table, which changes every year, and making sophisticated snap decisions for each shipment.Pierbridge’s parcel TMS platform,

21, 2017\nShare\n      In 2016, eCommerce in the U.S.grew 15% to $395b.During the same period, parcel spend grew 10% in the U.S., according to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP).LTL only grew by .5%, which reflects the continued shift to smaller more frequent shipments.eCommerce and parcel shipping are in lockstep and their pace is quickening.But with Amazon establishing free shipping as the new normal (now for premium services like same-day and Sunday delivery), eCommerce businesses are scrambling to protect their margins, even as the market continues to heat up.With Amazon’s shipping costs running at around 12% of sales, logistics professionals are starting to look at how they can reduce shipping costs as a percentage of revenue.It’s now a critical issue.Accurate Cost Accounting\nThe first step is determining what your shipping costs are.Today most businesses, especially those that rely on carrier-provided shipping systems, have only a very fragmented view of what they spend on shipping.Add to this, the information they get from various carrier-provided systems are not “normalized” for reporting purposes and in any case do not represent the final costs which include unexpected fees that show up on carrier invoices.Multi-carrier parcel TMS solutions can operate as cash registers, capturing costs no matter where they are incurred across the extended enterprise including purchasing, shopping carts, order entry, warehouses, suppliers, stores, returns, parts distribution, and mail centers.Parcel TMS systems that match carrier invoice costs against expected costs provide a final “source of truth” about transportation expenditures.Transportation Analytics\nEyeballing management reports can only take you so far in understanding how you can save money.With access to accurate, consolidated transportation cost data, analytics and modeling tools can help provide insights into how and where to find potential cost savings.“What if I used a regional carrier for this delivery area?”, “What if I were to drop ship from suppliers is zone 6?”, and “What will the new rate change mean to me in terms of increased costs?”are just a few of the questions that business analytic tools could answer.Competition is Good, More is Better\nTen years ago, UPS and FedEx ruled the roost.Then USPS became a more credible option because of its ability to perform last-mile delivery services.Now regional carriers and crowdsourced delivery services are coming out of the woodwork to meet increasing consumer demand for delivery options.With the right data at your disposal, combined with TMS analytics and controls, it is easier than ever to reduce delivery costs while providing superior service to customers.Rate Negotiation: “I Do it Once a Year, They Do it Every Day”\nLogistics professionals take a lot of pride in their ability to manage carrier relationships and negotiate contracts.All are convinced they have the best discounts.But how do they know?This is not an issue of skill – it’s really about information.This is an imbalance and disadvantage all shippers face with rate negotiations.Shippers need to know that their rates are competitive.Of course, getting below market rates is ideal – but NOT overpaying is really the minimum expectation most companies should have.Third party transportation experts are able to see across many businesses, do benchmarks, and see what constitutes a competitive rate.What’s more important than what your peers are paying?It’s not unusual for these consultants to find 20% savings by helping to make “adjustments” to carrier contracts and in a way that is fair to the carrier.Consultants can also find the optimum mix of multiple carrier services.This is significant with Amazon using shipping costs as a competitive weapon.Understanding SKU Transportation Costs\nIf shipping is free, then how do you price goods to take transportation costs into account?A dartboard could help, but a better approach is to use analytics to look at historical data and allocate transportation costs to each SKU.You are then in a position to make more accurate assumptions about how to price your products based on their total “landed” cost.TMS cartonization and palletization algorithms can also tell you how to pack and ship items at the lowest possible cost, based on order SKUs.Conclusion: Shipping Cost Containment is a Critical Issue\nAs eCommerce continues to drive demand for last-mile delivery services, you can expect your costs to go up at the same time consumers expect more free delivery options.Something has to give.Proactively addressing transportation cost management is the only path to protecting your bottom line.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/TT4G+ec9Q1vQnC6tUGcIZCzN7RcQj04drO8QBEh6Kg="},"79dbf7a9-0315-48e2-857f-f8bdd33f4bf6":{"id_":"79dbf7a9-0315-48e2-857f-f8bdd33f4bf6","metadata":{"url":"https://pierbridge.com/news/to-paraphrase-james-carville-its-shipping-costs-stupid/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"54782460-f4ca-45e7-8bc7-8a5ef280b2f6","metadata":{"url":"https://pierbridge.com/news/to-paraphrase-james-carville-its-shipping-costs-stupid/"},"hash":"s8SzQ+A3PYUhedePL1cOA9UiVl0OjWGAssZ+umVxP+s="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"eea0c2b7-e215-4039-8fa2-a3f898f7b41c","metadata":{"url":"https://pierbridge.com/news/to-paraphrase-james-carville-its-shipping-costs-stupid/"},"hash":"/TT4G+ec9Q1vQnC6tUGcIZCzN7RcQj04drO8QBEh6Kg="}},"text":"Consultants
