However, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, shipping costs worldwide skyrocketed. According to McKinsey, shipping a container from China to Europe costs up to six times more now than it did at the beginning of 2019.\\nDespite these challenges, businesses, whether small companies or large corporations, can still lower their shipping expenses and thus mitigate the impact of rising rates on their bottom line. Read on for five ways to reduce your shipping costs.\\n1. Monitor Your Shipping Volume\\nIf your contract includes volume-based discounts, avoid losing them by making sure your volume matches your tier. By regularly monitoring your volume and keeping within spending minimums, you can ensure that you always qualify for these discounts.\\nHowever, doing so can be challenging, as your shipping volume is likely to fluctuate over time. Using software or an intelligence platform can help make keeping track of expiring discounts much easier.\\n2. Audit Your Carrier’s Invoices\\nSome shipping companies offer on-time delivery or your money back. If the carrier you have a contract with offers this kind of guarantee, it will be worth your while to audit your invoices. A parcel audit will identify late deliveries, empowering you to alert your carrier that you are entitled to a refund.\\nYou can also uncover the following during an audit:\\nDuplicate bills\\nBecause of the high volume of shipping invoices, it’s possible for carriers to make a mistake and submit duplicate bills. Often, these bills have different reference or tracking numbers, making duplicates hard to spot. Carriers will typically issue refunds for bills paid more than once, but businesses should be proactive and identify duplicate bills before payments are made.\\nMissing discounts\\nLike any other business, shipping carriers are not immune to committing errors. It’s possible for a carrier to apply the wrong discount to an invoice or neglect to apply it at all. An audit will help you determine whether the correct discount rates were applied per the terms in your contract with the carrier so you can avoid overpaying.\\nRate Errors\\nPossible invoice errors include incorrect base rate, product classification, mileage, and weight. These errors, if left unidentified, can end up costing you. However, an audit will alert you to any inaccuracies in your invoices so you can request an adjustment or refund from your carriers.\\nA parcel audit takes hours or even longer, depending on the number of invoices you receive. What’s more, carrier invoices can be several pages long, making errors difficult to spot.\\nA software-assisted audit crunches your shipping data to pinpoint opportunities to save on shipping costs. It will identify overcharges, outsized line items, and other errors that translate to credits or refunds from your shipping carriers.\\n3. Watch Your Discount Expiration Dates\\nLosing discounts, due to expiration or because shipping volume no longer matches your tier, can significantly increase your shipping costs. For this reason, it’s essential to keep track of shipping discount expiration dates as well as your shipping volume.\\n4. Monitor Your Shipping Agreements\\nAnnual rate increases, surcharges, and other changes to your shipping agreements can result in skyrocketing shipping costs. Actively monitoring and managing them helps you avoid these pitfalls and help you make better shipping decisions.\\nHowever, keep in mind that manually monitoring your shipping agreements is a time-consuming, labor-intensive task. Because of the complexity of these agreements, there is a considerable risk of human error. Using an automated platform that can analyze shipping agreement data and alert you to any changes is a much better option.\\n5. Negotiate With Your Carrier\\nIt’s possible to negotiate better rates with your shipping carrier, but a lot of research, data collection, and analysis is required before you sit down to the table. Information you’d need to have include the frequency at which you ship products, how much tonnage you ship, proof of on-time payments, your freight description, and the freight class ratings you ship.\\nOnce you’ve collected all the necessary data, you can either arrange for a meeting with your account manager at your carrier or send requests for proposals (RFPs) to several carriers so you can compare rates and offers.\\nAt Reveel, we have extensive knowledge of and experience in carrier agreement negotiations. Our team will guide you throughout the process, identify what you can negotiate, and help you get the best deals.\\nSave Money on Shipping Costs With Reveel\\nThe team at Reveel is composed of former sales executives and pricing analysts from UPS, DHL, and FedEx.

It was almost as if the shippers were negotiating against themselves. He and his partner decided to start a company to help shippers – retail companies, e-commerce companies, equipment vendors, and more to better understand what the carriers were charging, where they stood in the market, and what discounts and reductions they could get.\\nJosh Dunham also serves on the board of Entrepreneurs Organization (EO) and will serve as the Orange County President in the next fiscal year. His passion is to “build.” Whether it’s Reveels’ technology products, company culture, high-performing teams, strategy, vision, or a motorcycle or truck, he loves creating things and making them great\\nThe Interview\\nAdVice\\nWhat makes Reveel unique, and what is the key benefit to customers?\\nReveel gives businesses that rely on shipping the power to analyze their own unique data and immediately see the cost impact of discounts or surcharge changes. Our business is built around empowering customers to level the playing field with major industry carriers, such as UPS and FedEx. Agreements can be monitored and compared in real-time, delivering actionable insights on ways to lower costs.\\nReveel is the only company that provides customers with a platform to benchmark their performance against that of their peers. Customers can easily diagnose their shipping health and compare it to other shippers with similar profiles, enabling them to identify exactly where they have opportunities for improvement. In addition, we offer actionable insights on what customers should do to make the improvements a reality.\\nYour key initiatives for success at Reveel or generally in your line of work?\\nA key initiative for being successful in the shipping industry is to stay close to the needs of companies that rely on shipping parcels.\\nThe 400+ interviews we conducted prior to developing and releasing our Shipping Intelligence Platform is just a start. At Reveel, we like to focus on our clients’ ‘jobs to be done,’ and what challenges they have performing those jobs – while at the same time bringing novel new data science technology to parcel shipping that the industry has never seen before.\\nHow are you leveraging Data at Reveel?\\nData drives our business and the decisions that we make. We use data to determine our company’s goals – and to further develop the strategic plan that guides us in obtaining these goals. We learned fairly quickly that without reliable data you’re operating in the dark.\\nPut simply, it becomes very difficult to make any educated decisions. Without data. you’re just guessing, and startups and small businesses can’t survive on guesswork. In addition, remember that just having data isn’t the answer – clean and reliable data is crucial. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say.\\n#1 mistake related to running a Data Analytics/Intelligence company?\\nThe biggest mistake that I’ve seen startups make is developing what they think the market wants rather than what the customer actually needs.\\nOne of the first steps in development should be conducting customer interviews with core customers, in order to better understand their job roles and the pain points that they experience every day. You should not move forward with developing new features or solutions until you have identified the pain points – and confirmed that your core customers are willing to pay you to solve the pain.\\nWhat does it take to succeed in building a profitable Data Analytics/Intelligence business?\\nSuccess in the data business really starts with having a strong ‘why.’ This will have a direct result on your company’s ability to articulate and sell its product. In addition to that, it takes a great team, with a strong product owner and some very talented developers to make it all come together. Last but not least, one of the most important things you can do is to listen to your customers and understand what exactly it is that they need. Solving a recurring problem for them in an easy, cost-effective way sells itself.\\nMost critical consideration when thinking of leaving a secure job to go off on your own?\\nThe most important thing to ask yourself is ‘why’ you are pursuing the direction you are going, and whether you are extremely passionate about it. Entrepreneurship can be a lonely road – especially at the start – and without a clear understanding of ‘why’ you are doing what you are doing, it’s easy to get lost.\\nHelpful tips for startup founders looking to raise capital and obtain funding?\\nThe key to catching the eye of the right kind of investment partner is to first create a great pitchbook that articulates the problem you solve that no one else does.\\nClearly demonstrate that you understand your core customer and the niche you are going to dominate. Highlight your value proposition and your key offerings. Have a plan on how the capital will be deployed, showing how their investment will be applied towards making your plan a reality. At the same time, be sure to take the time to learn what the potential investors are looking for. This will help you choose the right strategic investors for your business – the ones that will accelerate your company’s growth, not just give you money.\\nJosh Dunham's career advice for entrepreneurs and startup founders?\\nThe most important advice I can share is ‘don’t be afraid to fail.’ In order to be successful, you should be inquisitive by nature – and dedicated to learning. Entrepreneurship is not for the faint of heart, so buckle up and enjoy the ride.\\nAdVantage\\nWhat's new and exciting for Josh Dunham and/or for Reveel?\\nWe’re currently rolling out our Shipping Intelligence platform – the first Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model within the industry. We’ve invested heavily in the technology behind it, and after an acquisition and two-plus years of development, we’re releasing it to the market with an extremely compelling pricing model and value proposition. We’re excited for folks to see how it can empower them to quickly and easily transform complex shipping data into simple ways to save money. We feel this technology has game-changing potential in the long run.\\nWhat is your favorite part of your work?\\nThe positive impact we have on our customers’ businesses is my favorite part about what we do for a living. It used to be that saving money on shipping was just a ‘nice to have,’ to help customers increase their bottom line. Through the years, however, finding a way to lower your shipping costs has evolved to become a distinct competitive advantage. Now, what we help customers with is, at the very least, a ‘must have’ – and for several industries has become a critical factor in whether you are going to survive or not.\\nWhat motto/mantra inspires you?\\nThe mantra I try to guide Reveel by is to ‘hire the best people, measure the right things and do it all with the highest sense of integrity,’ By keeping your eye on those three things throughout the ups and downs of owning and managing a business, you’ll win.\\nTop business books for leading and inspiring innovation?\\nThere are three books that I’d have to say have had a tremendous impact on my business philosophy and how I try to lead and inspire innovation.\\nThe first one I’d recommend is “Start With Why” by Simon Sinek. This book does an excellent job of getting you thinking about the ‘why’ behind your organization, and how to better inspire those around you to innovate and believe in the company’s purpose.\\nThe next book that comes to mind is “Extreme Ownership” by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. This is a fascinating account of the authors’ experiences as U.S. Navy SEALs, and how the leadership lessons they learned while serving can be applied to today’s business world.\\nLastly, I’d add “Who” by Geoff Smart and Randy Street to the list. They state that the number one problem businesses of any size face is making sure that they hire the right people. They share advice and a method for evaluating talent which does help to change your perspective on how to get this critical action correct\\nWhat Else to Know\\nCheck out the Natfluence Candid Talk with Josh Dunham\\nJosh Dunham gets candid with Natfluence as he tells us about the shipping industry, how machine learning technology for shipping data can be used to reduce shipping costs, and the importance of trusting his instinct.\\nLearn More: Founders of Reveel, Josh Dunham & Chad Beville\\nWatch Josh Dunham & Chad Beville (founders of Reveel) discuss why they started the company and what they see as the future for Reveel.\\nPhoto Credit\\nPhotos courtesy of Josh Dunham and the Reveel team | reveelgroup.com.

Josh Dunham\\nApril 29, 2022\\nEven in ordinary times, shipping costs make up a significant portion of a business’s expenses.However, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, shipping costs worldwide skyrocketed.According to McKinsey, shipping a container from China to Europe costs up to six times more now than it did at the beginning of 2019.Despite these challenges, businesses, whether small companies or large corporations, can still lower their shipping expenses and thus mitigate the impact of rising rates on their bottom line.Read on for five ways to reduce your shipping costs.1.Monitor Your Shipping Volume\\nIf your contract includes volume-based discounts, avoid losing them by making sure your volume matches your tier.By regularly monitoring your volume and keeping within spending minimums, you can ensure that you always qualify for these discounts.However, doing so can be challenging, as your shipping volume is likely to fluctuate over time.Using software or an intelligence platform can help make keeping track of expiring discounts much easier.2.Audit Your Carrier’s Invoices\\nSome shipping companies offer on-time delivery or your money back.If the carrier you have a contract with offers this kind of guarantee, it will be worth your while to audit your invoices.A parcel audit will identify late deliveries, empowering you to alert your carrier that you are entitled to a refund.You can also uncover the following during an audit:\\nDuplicate bills\\nBecause of the high volume of shipping invoices, it’s possible for carriers to make a mistake and submit duplicate bills.Often, these bills have different reference or tracking numbers, making duplicates hard to spot.Carriers will typically issue refunds for bills paid more than once, but businesses should be proactive and identify duplicate bills before payments are made.Missing discounts\\nLike any other business, shipping carriers are not immune to committing errors.It’s possible for a carrier to apply the wrong discount to an invoice or neglect to apply it at all.An audit will help you determine whether the correct discount rates were applied per the terms in your contract with the carrier so you can avoid overpaying.Rate Errors\\nPossible invoice errors include incorrect base rate, product classification, mileage, and weight.These errors, if left unidentified, can end up costing you.However, an audit will alert you to any inaccuracies in your invoices so you can request an adjustment or refund from your carriers.A parcel audit takes hours or even longer, depending on the number of invoices you receive.What’s more, carrier invoices can be several pages long, making errors difficult to spot.A software-assisted audit crunches your shipping data to pinpoint opportunities to save on shipping costs.It will identify overcharges, outsized line items, and other errors that translate to credits or refunds from your shipping carriers.3.Watch Your Discount Expiration Dates\\nLosing discounts, due to expiration or because shipping volume no longer matches your tier, can significantly increase your shipping costs.For this reason, it’s essential to keep track of shipping discount expiration dates as well as your shipping volume.4.Monitor Your Shipping Agreements\\nAnnual rate increases, surcharges, and other changes to your shipping agreements can result in skyrocketing shipping costs.Actively monitoring and managing them helps you avoid these pitfalls and help you make better shipping decisions.However, keep in mind that manually monitoring your shipping agreements is a time-consuming, labor-intensive task.Because of the complexity of these agreements, there is a considerable risk of human error.Using an automated platform that can analyze shipping agreement data and alert you to any changes is a much better option.5.Negotiate With Your Carrier\\nIt’s possible to negotiate better rates with your shipping carrier, but a lot of research, data collection, and analysis is required before you sit down to the table.Information you’d need to have include the frequency at which you ship products, how much tonnage you ship, proof of on-time payments, your freight description, and the freight class ratings you ship.Once you’ve collected all the necessary data, you can either arrange for a meeting with your account manager at your carrier or send requests for proposals (RFPs) to several carriers so you can compare rates and offers.At Reveel, we have extensive knowledge of and experience in carrier agreement negotiations.Our team will guide you throughout the process, identify what you can negotiate, and help you get the best deals.Save Money on Shipping Costs With Reveel\\nThe team at Reveel is composed

CLIP\\nINTERVIEW\\nBASICS\\nThe biggest mistake that I’ve seen startups make is developing what they think the market wants rather than what the customer actually needs.Josh Dunham\\nCareer Clip\\nWho is Josh Dunham?Josh Dunham is co-founder of Reveel, the only do-it-yourself parcel shipping intelligence platform that uses machine learning to transform complex shipping data into simple ways to save money.Reveel is now the industry leader in machine learning technology for shipping data.Dunham started the company after working at DHL and seeing a pattern – a common problem that most companies with large shipping expenses had – the fact that there was so little information out there about what the carriers were charging.It was almost as if the shippers were negotiating against themselves.He and his partner decided to start a company to help shippers – retail companies, e-commerce companies, equipment vendors, and more to better understand what the carriers were charging, where they stood in the market, and what discounts and reductions they could get.Josh Dunham also serves on the board of Entrepreneurs Organization (EO) and will serve as the Orange County President in the next fiscal year.His passion is to “build.”Whether it’s Reveels’ technology products, company culture, high-performing teams, strategy, vision, or a motorcycle or truck, he loves creating things and making them great\\nThe Interview\\nAdVice\\nWhat makes Reveel unique, and what is the key benefit to customers?Reveel gives businesses that rely on shipping the power to analyze their own unique data and immediately see the cost impact of discounts or surcharge changes.Our business is built around empowering customers to level the playing field with major industry carriers, such as UPS and FedEx.Agreements can be monitored and compared in real-time, delivering actionable insights on ways to lower costs.Reveel is the only company that provides customers with a platform to benchmark their performance against that of their peers.Customers can easily diagnose their shipping health and compare it to other shippers with similar profiles, enabling them to identify exactly where they have opportunities for improvement.In addition, we offer actionable insights on what customers should do to make the improvements a reality.Your key initiatives for success at Reveel or generally in your line of work?A key initiative for being successful in the shipping industry is to stay close to the needs of companies that rely on shipping parcels.The 400+ interviews we conducted prior to developing and releasing our Shipping Intelligence Platform is just a start.At Reveel, we like to focus on our clients’ ‘jobs to be done,’ and what challenges they have performing those jobs – while at the same time bringing novel new data science technology to parcel shipping that the industry has never seen before.How are you leveraging Data at Reveel?Data drives our business and the decisions that we make.We use data to determine our company’s goals – and to further develop the strategic plan that guides us in obtaining these goals.We learned fairly quickly that without reliable data you’re operating in the dark.Put simply, it becomes very difficult to make any educated decisions.Without data.you’re just guessing, and startups and small businesses can’t survive on guesswork.In addition, remember that just having data isn’t the answer – clean and reliable data is crucial.Garbage in, garbage out, as they say.#1 mistake related to running a Data Analytics/Intelligence company?The biggest mistake that I’ve seen startups make is developing what they think the market wants rather than what the customer actually needs.One of the first steps in development should be conducting customer interviews with core customers, in order to better understand their job roles and the pain points that they experience every day.You should not move forward with developing new features or solutions until you have identified the pain points – and confirmed that your core customers are willing to pay you to solve the pain.What does it take to succeed in building a profitable Data Analytics/Intelligence business?Success in the data business really starts with having a strong ‘why.’This will have a direct result on your company’s ability to articulate and sell its product.In addition to that, it takes a great team, with a strong product owner and some very talented developers to make it all come together.Last but not least, one of the most important things you can do is to listen to your customers and understand what exactly it is that they need.Solving a recurring problem for them in an easy, cost-effective way sells itself.Most critical consideration when thinking of leaving a secure job to go off on your own?\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"wsKMifoPn77U7I219m+6GoXcXk8RSYDGrKft+I0CLC0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ff0c6e6c-dc65-477a-8b89-e7063f03e233":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ff0c6e6c-dc65-477a-8b89-e7063f03e233\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://natfluence.com/interview/josh-dunham-of-reveel/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"a070a5a0-e313-42d1-8cb7-447485ad5bc7\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://natfluence.com/interview/josh-dunham-of-reveel/\"},\"hash\":\"5TTiZFehgN7FhrdWUBTlwgMO7+/RedOtpmCbiK7h7LI=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"bd0f3113-7c3e-4aa2-971e-33a60ce5d983\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://natfluence.com/interview/josh-dunham-of-reveel/\"},\"hash\":\"wsKMifoPn77U7I219m+6GoXcXk8RSYDGrKft+I0CLC0=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"2d5b02e4-2f85-4686-8a00-e6e722b98566\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"r85UxvHgZZAHX8GuyLk8c3oxp8t9dOEGBRsfpnmITbc=\"}},\"text\":\"You

itself.Most critical consideration when thinking of leaving a secure job to go off on your own?The most important thing to ask yourself is ‘why’ you are pursuing the direction you are going, and whether you are extremely passionate about it.Entrepreneurship can be a lonely road – especially at the start – and without a clear understanding of ‘why’ you are doing what you are doing, it’s easy to get lost.Helpful tips for startup founders looking to raise capital and obtain funding?The key to catching the eye of the right kind of investment partner is to first create a great pitchbook that articulates the problem you solve that no one else does.Clearly demonstrate that you understand your core customer and the niche you are going to dominate.Highlight your value proposition and your key offerings.Have a plan on how the capital will be deployed, showing how their investment will be applied towards making your plan a reality.At the same time, be sure to take the time to learn what the potential investors are looking for.This will help you choose the right strategic investors for your business – the ones that will accelerate your company’s growth, not just give you money.Josh Dunham's career advice for entrepreneurs and startup founders?The most important advice I can share is ‘don’t be afraid to fail.’In order to be successful, you should be inquisitive by nature – and dedicated to learning.Entrepreneurship is not for the faint of heart, so buckle up and enjoy the ride.AdVantage\\nWhat's new and exciting for Josh Dunham and/or for Reveel?We’re currently rolling out our Shipping Intelligence platform – the first Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model within the industry.We’ve invested heavily in the technology behind it, and after an acquisition and two-plus years of development, we’re releasing it to the market with an extremely compelling pricing model and value proposition.We’re excited for folks to see how it can empower them to quickly and easily transform complex shipping data into simple ways to save money.We feel this technology has game-changing potential in the long run.What is your favorite part of your work?The positive impact we have on our customers’ businesses is my favorite part about what we do for a living.It used to be that saving money on shipping was just a ‘nice to have,’ to help customers increase their bottom line.Through the years, however, finding a way to lower your shipping costs has evolved to become a distinct competitive advantage.Now, what we help customers with is, at the very least, a ‘must have’ – and for several industries has become a critical factor in whether you are going to survive or not.What motto/mantra inspires you?The mantra I try to guide Reveel by is to ‘hire the best people, measure the right things and do it all with the highest sense of integrity,’ By keeping your eye on those three things throughout the ups and downs of owning and managing a business, you’ll win.Top business books for leading and inspiring innovation?There are three books that I’d have to say have had a tremendous impact on my business philosophy and how I try to lead and inspire innovation.The first one I’d recommend is “Start With Why” by Simon Sinek.This book does an excellent job of getting you thinking about the ‘why’ behind your organization, and how to better inspire those around you to innovate and believe in the company’s purpose.The next book that comes to mind is “Extreme Ownership” by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin.This is a fascinating account of the authors’ experiences as U.S.Navy SEALs, and how the leadership lessons they learned while serving can be applied to today’s business world.Lastly, I’d add “Who” by Geoff Smart and Randy Street to the list.They state that the number one problem businesses of any size face is making sure that they hire the right people.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"Pcr8/Zhj/VR8/aCx1JRPqIvT1f/BTp5AHzvqFTIFVUo=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2d5b02e4-2f85-4686-8a00-e6e722b98566":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2d5b02e4-2f85-4686-8a00-e6e722b98566\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://natfluence.com/interview/josh-dunham-of-reveel/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"a070a5a0-e313-42d1-8cb7-447485ad5bc7\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://natfluence.com/interview/josh-dunham-of-reveel/\"},\"hash\":\"5TTiZFehgN7FhrdWUBTlwgMO7+/RedOtpmCbiK7h7LI=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"ff0c6e6c-dc65-477a-8b89-e7063f03e233\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://natfluence.com/interview/josh-dunham-of-reveel/\"},\"hash\":\"t+1YjSMpanIBIhuFYTkju3AZvaSvBvKSx/YOvzSvvlk=\"}},\"text\":\"Top
