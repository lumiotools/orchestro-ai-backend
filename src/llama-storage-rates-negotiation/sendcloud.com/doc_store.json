Well then, you’ve come to the right place. \\nIn today’s world, customers are incredibly price-sensitive. The #1 reason for checkout abandonment is high delivery costs, so reducing your logistics expenses must be a priority.\\nBut fear not, our e-commerce experts have compiled their top strategies to help you seriously reduce your shipping costs. \\nDrawing from their experience working with countless e-commerce stores, they share the most common ways businesses lose money on shipping and logistics, and offer their expert advice on how to avoid these pitfalls. \\nDon’t let logistics costs hurt your bottom line any longer – read on for the inside scoop!\\n6 Expert Tips to Reduce Shipping Costs: \\nResearch all possible shipping methods for the cheapest rates\\nLeverage partners or 3rd-party solutions for negotiated rates\\nOffer flexible delivery methods in your checkout\\nInvest in warehouse management\\nSet up a good returns process\\nUse shipping rules to assign the cheapest shipping method\\n1: Research all possible shipping methods for the cheapest rates\\n“E-commerce stores tend to spend too much money on their shipping because they haven’t researched all the shipping options out there. Often, retailers ship with a carrier or delivery method that is more expensive than something that would be better for their products or customers simply because they weren’t aware of what’s possible.” – Ben Haslam\\nAs an e-commerce business, presuming you already ship with the cheapest service, or choosing the first carrier you negotiate rates with, can quickly lead to profits going down the drain. \\nRates vary greatly between each carrier for different destinations, weights, sizes and more, so doing diligent research is essential.\\nThis is especially true when shipping internationally, as relying on one carrier to ship to all your destinations will cost more than finding the best rate for each location. \\nTo get the most cost-effective shipping strategy, here are some practical tips:\\nResearch all possible shipping services\\nEvaluate which options match your particular needs\\nIdentify the right combination of carriers, services and costs for your particular packages (eg size, weight, destination, and speed of delivery)\\nCreate a multi-courier strategy combining the best and cheapest options\\nMonitor rates in your local and international markets\\nMaximise savings while offering great service to customers\\n2: Leverage partners or 3rd-party solutions to get cheaper shipping rates\\nWith carriers becoming increasingly overloaded and the number of e-commerce businesses competing to negotiate shipping rates growing, it’s becoming more difficult to obtain cheaper shipping rates from carriers. \\n“More and more often, e-commerce businesses are unable to even get in touch with carriers to start negotiating in the first place, leaving them stuck with the higher-cost shipping rates available to all.” – Eros Cavallari\\nIf you’re struggling to negotiate rates, or you just don’t know where to start when it comes to negotiations, consider the following tips: \\nKnow your volume: Carriers are more likely to negotiate rates if you have high shipping volume. Make sure you have accurate data to share.\\nBe ready to negotiate: Negotiations take time but can save your business money. Be prepared and don’t accept the first offer.\\nHighlight business strengths: Emphasise growth or a strong online presence to encourage carriers to offer better rates.\\nConsider long-term contracts: Some carriers offer lower rates for long-term contracts. Weigh the pros and cons before committing.\\nUnderstand pricing: Different carriers have different pricing structures, so understand them to negotiate better rates.\\nNegotiate services: Consider negotiating services like tracking or insurance, which can be included in the base rate or offered at an additional cost.\\nDon’t be afraid to walk away: If negotiations aren’t going well, don’t be afraid to look for other carriers that can offer better rates.\\nIf you’re struggling to contact the carriers directly, or you wish to expand your carrier network without entering into a contract, look for a partner or solution that can help you access lower, negotiated rates without needing to go to the carrier directly.\\nSolutions like Sendcloud are able to build connections with the carriers and they use that partnership leverage to attain the best rates possible.\\n3: Offer flexible delivery methods in your checkout\\nCustomers are becoming increasingly demanding, and according to this year’s E-commerce Delivery Compass, customers expect a range of options to choose from. \\n“Failing to offer a variety of delivery methods in your checkout is a sure-fire way to consistently lose potential customers, and therefore miss out on profit. Investing in multiple delivery options may seem daunting, but losing customers in your checkout will ultimately cost you more in the long run, especially with the increasing cost of customer acquisition.” – Henriette Vogt\\nHere’s some insights into what shipping methods consumers expect to see in the checkout:\\nNext-day delivery is the 2nd most popular shipping method for consumers after Standard Home Delivery. Although more expensive, people who want their package as soon as possible are willing to pay for it. \\nCollection from a pick-up point is increasingly popular with 21% of consumers stating they prefer to collect their package at a local store, and a further 16% preferring service point delivery. (Plus, this method has the added bonus of being cheaper for you). \\nAlmost a third of consumers’ favourite shipping option is nominated day delivery. Customers want to choose when the delivery will come to ensure they are in to receive it. (And another added bonus is this method will decrease the number of undelivered packages). \\nCO2 neutral delivery is growing in popularity, with almost 1 in 5 stating it’s their most preferred shipping option. It even scored higher than evening, mailbox, and locker delivery. \\nTo offer more flexibility, consider implementing a multi-carrier strategy to get the cheapest rates for the services you need. \\nAn all-in-one shipping solution can help you seamlessly manage your logistics from one platform, connecting your shop system to various shipping methods and integrating them seamlessly into your checkout.\\n4: Invest in warehouse organisation\\n“More often than not, we see e-commerce businesses losing a lot of money from poor warehouse management. And it’s a sneaky one, as many businesses don’t realise how much it’s actually costing them until we start implementing the changes and they see the total savings.” – Eros Cavallari\\nCommon ways that poor warehouse management will eat into your profits include:\\nItems being stored in the wrong location so the incorrect products are shipped (increasing returns)\\nWorkers needing more time to navigate the warehouse \\nOrders taking longer to process \\nOverstocking or stockouts occurring more frequently\\nAnd items being lost or damaged \\nStart by assessing how things are running in your warehouse, and consider introducing any of the following:\\nSet clear locations for individual SKUs \\nMake sure picking staff are competently trained to navigate the warehouse quickly and effectively\\nThink about which products are your best sellers and make sure the most popular items are easy to locate and close to the packing stations\\nIf you don’t have one already, consider setting up a picking and packing software to make it easier and more efficient for your staff \\nEnsure your warehouse is kept tidy with minimal obstacles for your staff\\nMake sure every operation has a clear process to keep things running smoothly \\n“There are many different strategies you can use for warehouse organisation, so try to research a few and implement what will work best for your particular business needs.”\\n5: Set up a good returns process \\nInvesting in a returns management solution is critical to help increase efficiency in handling your returns. And increased efficiency will always inherently save you money. \\n“We all know returns are a pain in the butt, and that they cost a lot. But accepting that returns are inevitable can be an empowering strategy and it can really help you save on costs as well.” – Henriette Vogt\\nStart by investigating your current returns management process and see where you might be wasting time and money. \\nCommon problems with handling returns that will increase your costs include: \\nNot tracking incoming returns so a return will randomly arrive at the warehouse \\nStaff not knowing up-front what’s being returned, why, or what they need to do to process it\\nNot using pre-negotiated rates or specific return shipping methods for your return shipments, making the shipping costs more expensive\\nTaking too long to process a return item and preparing it for resale\\nMaking customers contact your support team to manually create a return, costing the team time (and ergo money)\\nMake sure to consider what you can improve with your returns policy as well. In the long run, an accessible and customer-friendly returns policy will help to increase your customer retention and reduce the amount you need to spend on capturing new customers.\\n6: Use shipping rules to assign the cheapest shipping method\\nAutomation can be a game-changer when it comes to processing orders, and one particular tool that has consistently proven to reduce shipping costs is Shipping Rules. \\nShipping Rules automatically apply IF THIS – THEN THAT actions to each order, covering a vast range of pre-set conditions. Here are some examples of how they can save you money:\\nAssign the correct delivery method based on customer checkout choices\\nAssign different methods based on product SKU\\nAssign a shipping method for heavier shipments based on weight\\nApply the correct shipping method for international shipments based on destination\\nAutomatically apply insurance to higher-value packages\\nAnd so much more…\\n“Sendcloud’s clients have seen remarkable savings, with one of our largest customers saving €60,000 in outgoing expenses in just one year. The client was able to save money by setting up a shipping rule that checked each order’s delivery address and assigned the cheapest carrier based on location. This was all done automatically, so staff simply had to print the label and send the package on its way.” – Miguel Delgad\\nTry making your own shipping rules to see just how easy it is. \\nConclusion: \\nWe hope that the e-commerce strategies shared by our experts have been valuable to you and will help reduce shipping costs.

Cheaper shipping is and remains important for both you and your customer. After all, passing on the full shipping costs to the customer is not an option. So what can you do to keep your profit margin intact? To help you, we will list 10 tips for online retailers who want to lower their shipping costs.\\nHow can online stores send cheaper parcels?\\nA frequently asked question in the field of e-commerce logistics is how best to achieve cheap shipping. Whoever you plan to ship with (the postal service, DHL, DPD or UPS), as an online store you just want to do so as cheaply as possible at home and abroad. These 10 tips will help you make that happen!\\nTip 1: Cheaper shipping starts with negotiation\\nEach carrier uses a price schedule based on volume: the more parcels you ship, the lower the rate becomes. Many small online stores do not realise that they too can have bargaining power with carriers such as the postal service, DHL, DPD and UPS.\\nIt’s always good to compare the cost of sending parcels before you partner with a carrier. Don’t be afraid to contact several shipping companies to inquire about their rates.\\nIf you let them know that you are comparing carriers for cheaper shipping of your parcels and you expect your online store to grow, you may be able to get a better price.\\nTip 2: Join forces with another online store\\nThe more parcels you send per month, the lower the cost per parcel. Have you ever thought about joining forces with other online stores?\\nBy purchasing shipping capacity together, you can qualify for lower shipping rates. Look at which companies are in your area and could benefit from working with you. This way, you can negotiate lower rates together from one account.\\nTip 3: Have other companies pay the shipping costs\\nDo your products appeal to a specific target group? Then there are probably a lot of companies that would like to advertise and be visible to your customers.\\nYou can actively approach these parties and ask them to sponsor some or all of your shipping costs. In return, you will add that company’s flyer to the package with every order from your online store.\\nOf course, it’s not a good idea to fill the box with advertising. A discount code, for example, gives your customer real value. Also make sure it doesn’t have a negative effect on your own brand image.\\nCarefully choose a partner company that fits your online store and just be honest with your customer. There’s nothing your customers respect more than a transparent company.\\nTip 4: Be clever about the parcel size\\nThink carefully about the packaging in which you send your products. Sometimes it can make a huge difference if products can be sent in a smaller package (such as an envelope) instead of in a box.\\nFor example, have you ever thought about a letterbox package or even regular mail? A letterbox package can be sent cheaply and, just like an ordinary parcel, it has a Track & Trace code. An additional advantage is that your customer does not have to be at home to receive the product.\\nRegular mail, on the other hand, has no Track & Trace code. But, if you sell relatively cheap products with a low margin, it can be a good alternative. Think of spinners or other small gifts.\\nIn that case, keep your customer well informed about the shipment date because the customer cannot track the shipment. Also mention that the parcel will be delivered within 24 hours.\\nTip 5: Reuse packaging material\\nKeep all the packaging material you receive yourself, because reusing boxes and filling material can save you a lot of money on packaging costs.\\nEspecially smaller online stores can reduce shipping costs considerably in this way. You can even ask family and friends to keep packaging materials or see if there is a company nearby that throws away a lot of material unnecessarily.\\nTip 6: Use an online shipping service\\nArrange the franking and payment of your parcels online. Large carriers such as your national postal service often have an online shipping service that makes it easy to send a parcel.\\nJust specify what you want to send and to whom, and pay easily online. Then print the shipping label, stick it on the box, and hand over the parcel or have it picked up.\\nThe advantages of online franking are that it is cheaper and that you, as a business customer, often qualify for volume discounts. It also saves you time spent queueing at the post office.\\nTip 7: Purchase packaging material in bulk\\nWhen you buy large quantities of packaging material, you often get a substantial bulk discount. So look at the kind of packaging you use the most and, instead of ordering every month, consider buying a six-month supply.\\nThis is another area in which it’s a good idea to compare prices from several companies (packaging wholesalers). For example, take a look at Rajapack.\\nAnd don’t forget to pack correctly! If you pack carelessly and your product gets damaged, shipping really becomes expensive.\\nEven if a parcel is insured, you will not be reimbursed if it is carelessly packed. Therefore, always tape boxes using the ‘H method’ and keep at least 6 cm between the box and the product.\\nTip 8: Think in kilos\\nHow heavy are your products, INCLUDING packaging? Too often, mistakes are still made when specifying weights. The weight also determines the shipping price of your parcel.\\nIf you ship to service points, the maximum allowed weight is often 20 kg. For home delivery, it is usually 30.5 kg. Shipping your products in the correct weight class can save you a lot of money.\\nParcels that are too heavy often incur an extremely high surcharge (such as a pallet surcharge) because a different shipping method is used. Weigh your parcels carefully to avoid surprises.\\nTip 9: Ship to service points\\nAnother possibility is to ship to a service point. Because multiple parcels are delivered to a service point, carriers can charge less for this shipping option.\\nThe delivery time depends on which carrier you are shipping with, so shipping to service points via multiple carriers can be an interesting option. In any case, always let your customers make the decision themselves.\\nCustomers demand choice in their delivery options, so it’s a smart strategy to let them choose what they want. Offer free shipping to service points or a few euros more for home delivery.\\nPeople will often still opt for paid home delivery but, since you let the customer choose, they don’t mind paying for shipping.\\nTip 10: Compare shipping costs and send parcels cheaper\\nWould you rather not negotiate with carriers yourself or look for companies you can work with? Then we have good news!\\nAt Sendcloud, we combine the power of more than 15,000 online stores and work with carriers such as DHL, DPD, UPS and Same Day Delivery.\\nThis allows us to offer you competitive shipping rates and let you decide how you want to send your parcels.

Add the fact that sometimes shipping invoices are higher than expected and it feels like a financial nightmare.\\nSurcharges or missed delivery attempts can easily increase shipping costs. The worst part? It’s not always clear where these additional costs come from, and an average of 5% of parcels are invoiced incorrectly, leaving you in the dark.\\nThis calls for a change. Let’s explore four different ways to detect hidden shipping overcharges and save on your shipping costs.\\nWhat causes hidden shipping overcharges?\\nIt’s a no-brainer that saving on shipping costs has a significant impact on your profit margins. But, if you don’t have smart data at hand to verify that all elements on the invoice are correct, it can be quite a challenge.\\nLet’s take a look at how hidden overcharges can occur and see how you can identify and eliminate them once and for all.\\n3 common types of hidden charges\\nGlobal e-commerce sales are on pace to reach $6.3 trillion in 2024. Which has led to an increase in the overall volume of shipments, pressuring logistics companies to deliver faster and more efficiently. Which also has an impact on shipping costs, because deviations can have multiple causes.\\nYou can think of inaccurate pricing, surcharges, damages or losses, unforeseen circumstances in delivery, and more.\\nLet’s have a look at the three most common types of hidden charges to look out for.\\n1. Surcharges\\nSurcharges happen frequently, especially when you ship large volumes of parcels. It shouldn’t be a surprise to spot a surcharge on your invoice or even repeatedly receive the same surcharge. Surcharges are additional fees that carriers add on top of the agreed shipping price.\\nSome of the most common surcharges are:\\nFuel surcharges\\nSeasonal surcharges\\nSurcharges for private delivery\\nNon-bendable packages\\nIllegible addresses\\nIncorrect weight classes\\nMost surcharges are calculated after parcels are processed, which has one big downside: they become less visible and can even appear on your invoice with a delay.\\nWant to avoid common surcharges? Make sure package dimensions match the printed labels.\\nIn freight shipments, some surcharges are also called accessorial fees. This often happens when additional handling is needed due to the size, weight, or packaging of the item.\\nA lift gate is another example of a special service, as the carrier must pick up or deliver packages to a place without a shipping dock.\\n2. Inaccurate data\\nInaccurate data and incorrect calculations also contribute to hidden overcharges, and they’re not easy to track either, making it an expensive and tricky process\\nSome mistakes related to inaccurate data are:\\nIncorrect exchange rates (when shipping internationally)\\nWrong calculation of weights, parcel/pallets numbers\\nDuplicated shipments on the same invoice\\nContractual errors leading to differences in the negotiates versus invoiced rates\\nMissed volume discounts leading to paying too much (when more was shipped) or paying a free because the volumes weren’t met\\n3. Unmet delivery promises\\nLast but not least, unmet promises contribute to higher shipping costs. Unmet delivery promises refer to shipments that weren’t delivered within the agreed time frame.\\nImagine 20 of your parcels were supposed to be express shipments. If they were delivered after 24 hours, you could have saved money by choosing a standard shipping method instead of a premium one.\\nPremium delivery is expensive, especially for international shipping. You also need to spend time addressing customer complaints and providing solutions to ensure they receive their orders timely, which impacts your revenue too.\\nAnd the worst part of it all is, if you don’t have the right software to identify these unmet delivery promises, you’ll never know if you’ve paid too much.\\n4 ways to detect hidden shipping overcharges\\nNow that you know the most common reasons for hidden overcharges, it’s already easier to spot them. But what options do you have to ensure all your carrier invoices are checked at all times? You have several options to run parcel audits, which we will explain in detail to help you make the decision that best suits your business.\\n1. Run manual audits\\nRunning manual audits will likely be the least favorable option as it can be a daunting task. That’s probably also the reason why checking invoices is often neglected. Depending on your company size and the number of parcels you ship, it may be a feasible option.\\nHere’s a step-by-step process on how to manually check your carrier invoices using Excel:\\nReview invoice details: Check the invoice number, dates, items, and prices.\\nVerify shipment counts: Ensure the total number of parcels shipped aligns with the scanned events.\\nCheck dimensions and weight accuracy: Compare the labels you created with the provided dimensions and weight.\\nReview surcharges: Identify service level charges and other surcharges mentioned on the invoice and analyze them thoroughly. If the total amount is higher than on any other invoice, consider double-checking the invoice and carrier contract.\\nAudit for duplicate charges: Identify duplicates which might be the easiest task to perform manually.\\nCross-reference with tracking data: Compare a comprehensive overview of your tracking data with the invoice to identify any outliers.\\nThis process can easily lead to a high workload for one of your team members. Luckily there are multiple smarter ways to run parcel audits.\\n2. Use parcel audit software\\nWith millions of parcels being shipped by different carriers, software has become increasingly intelligent. Parcel audit software can be a real lifesaver in this case. This software is capable of cross-checking shipments based on your carrier contract, order, and parcel data.\\nParcel audit software automatically identifies mistakes and overcharges on your invoice. But that’s not all. It also integrates various data sources to conduct audits and provide valuable insights:\\nIt combines multiple data sources such as invoices, contracts, and tracking information.\\nIt provides detailed information on the invoice, including surcharges, incorrect charges, duplicates, and more.\\nIt verifies shipments and checks if they were delivered as expected.\\nIt reports on incorrectly charged shipments and forecasts shipping costs for the future.\\nIt offers insights on how you can potentially reduce shipping costs based on volumes and shipping conditions across multiple carriers.\\nWith parcel audit software, like our shipping intelligence solution, you know if you pay too much, you can improve financial reporting and save on your shipping costs in general.\\n3. Collaborate with a third-party auditor\\nAnother option to run parcel audits for your e-commerce shipments is to outsource it fully.\\nThird-party auditors use their own proprietary software to run an audit on shipping invoices.\\nThey often also take the responsibility of applying carrier refunds. Some of the data third-party auditors check is:\\nLate deliveries\\nLost packages\\nDuplicate billing\\nAddress correction charges\\nIncorrect size and weight charges\\nMissed discounts\\nThird-party auditors often specialize in specific carriers. If you’re shipping with multiple carriers, make sure their expertise matches the carriers you use. It’s also wise to consider their rates, as hiring an auditor can be expensive and might negate any savings.\\n4. Forecast future growth\\nThis might not be a practical way to audit your invoices, but it can definitely help to cut costs and prevent overcharges. By forecasting future growth, you can make estimates on your shipping volumes, allowing you to negotiate better rates with carriers.\\nAnd what about more efficient shipping methods? If you know you’re going to grow in a certain country, you can look into 3PL solutions, local warehouses, or even directly sending parcels to local hubs to benefit from local pick-ups and shipping rates.\\nAnd there’s more. Here are some additional benefits of proper forecasting shipping volumes:\\nWith proper forecasting, it becomes easier to spot differences in projected versus actual shipping costs. Making it easier to spot discrepancies.\\nForecasting future growth also helps determine whether you need to invest in additional technologies or partners to reduce the risk of errors that can lead to inefficiencies or extra costs.\\nForecasting growth also supports timely delivery, avoiding stockouts and minimizing the risk of shipping delays or errors. If you’re going to ship way more to a certain destination, you might want to consider using the best carrier for that. Through carrier benchmarking, you can make the right decisions to avoid overcharges afterward.\\nBy forecasting future growth you can make estimates on your shipping volumes allowing you to negotiate better rates with carriers and optimize your carrier portfolio.\\nUse invoice data to decrease shipping costs\\nNext to checking invoices when you receive them, you can also use them proactively to avoid future surcharges and mistakes, and optimize the delivery experience in general. Because using parcel data should go beyond simply tracking it.\\nEvaluate carrier performance\\nInvoice checks not only help you see if you’re paying too much but also allow you to evaluate carrier performance. If invoices continuously contain mistakes or numerous surcharges, you might want to consider using different carriers.\\nA practical example would be to examine all shipments that include surcharges. When parcel dimensions exceed certain limits, carriers often apply additional charges. Switching carriers might help cut costs when another carrier allows different dimensions or offers a specific shipping method for it.\\nWhile another shipment type might lead to higher costs, in most cases, the basic fee including surcharges is more expensive than shipping with a premium method that supports large parcels.\\nMonitor service-level agreements (SLAs)\\nWe’ve mentioned this before, but checking invoices can help see if carriers keep their delivery promises. Especially with software that checks invoices, it combines carrier data with your contract to see if delivery promises were met.\\nIf your carrier often doesn’t deliver on time and you have proof, you can use it to increase your negotiation power. Confront your carrier if it’s not keeping up with your agreement. You can also use the data to compare offers from other carriers.\\nHow to automatically run parcel audits with Sendcloud’s invoice check\\nWant to automatically check invoices and use smart data to avoid expensive overcharges and cut shipping costs in general?

Shipping expenses can quickly stack up and cut into your company’s profits, and even more so when mistakes are made.\\nThis is where parcel audit software comes in as a life-saver. Are you ready to transform your business’ shipping expenses? We’ve put together a list of the top 23 parcel audit software solutions for e-commerce in 2024 for your convenience.\\nWhat is parcel audit software exactly, and why would you invest in it?\\nThe most important thing you need to know about parcel audit software is that it helps find shipping mistakes, recover costs, and improve efficiency.\\nPicture this scenario: Certain shipping surcharges are applied to a shipment, but they seem incorrect. This is no small concern when carrier surcharges can account for up to 30% of the total cost of a single shipment. Or, you think to yourself: “My delivery promise was not met. Why pay for an express shipment if it wasn’t delivered within the right time frame?”\\nWith parcel audit software as the hero of the story, checking invoices becomes simple, saving you significant effort. This tool helps you lower shipping expenses by spotting billing mistakes and getting back money owed.\\nOver half of logistics companies (58%) anticipate that AI will become widely adopted and take over many tasks in the industry. Instead of hiring more people and time for manual checks, why not invest in software that can handle it for you automatically? Especially when this software catches repeated fees, delayed shipments, and other charging errors that might slip past unnoticed otherwise.\\nThis technology gives you complete insight into every detail of shipment bills, better equipping you to manage what you spend on sending goods out. If you’ve been wondering whether a surcharge should apply to a particular shipment, or if you simply want to know the costs for a shipment and see if it can be cheaper, then parcel audit software is a great solution for you.\\nThe benefits of parcel audit software\\nParcel audit software brings a lot of perks to the table in a world where timing and cost-effectiveness could tip the scale between success and failure. Did you know that about 61% of invoices are paid late due to invoicing mistakes? Ask yourself, if unnoticed errors can make such a big difference, what else can a carrier invoice check do for your business?\\nHere’s how parcel audit software helps you:\\nStops you from overpaying: Hidden costs are a thing of the past.

Established in 2012 in Eindhoven, Netherlands, Sendcloud set out with an ambitious goal: to revolutionize the logistics industry. Over the past decade, we have seen this all-in-one shipping platform evolve into one of Europe's fastest-growing tech companies. But what exactly sets Sendcloud apart? Let’s delve into the intricacies of this remarkable company and explore its innovative solutions that have changed the face of shipping for online retailers.\\nFrom Humble Beginnings to Industry Pioneers\\nIt all started in a small office with a big idea—streamlining the shipping process for e-commerce businesses. The founders quickly realized that the growing online retail sector was plagued with shipping inefficiencies and high costs. In response, Sendcloud was designed to offer seamless integration with over 30 international carriers and more than 25 popular e-commerce platforms. This feature alone took the industry by storm, giving businesses the flexibility to choose the best shipping options tailored to their specific needs. Fast forward to today, Sendcloud is not just a service provider but a solution architect that simplifies and automates shipping to allow businesses to focus on what they do best: selling.\\nInnovative Business Strategy and Model\\nOperating on a Software as a Service (SaaS) model, Sendcloud presents various subscription plans that cater to e-commerce businesses of all sizes. From the basic free plan to premium plans packed with advanced features, each tier is curated to meet different operational requirements. What truly makes Sendcloud special is its ability to integrate with multiple carriers and e-commerce platforms effortlessly, something that 85% of users find crucial for their operational efficiency (Statista 2023). Additionally, the platform provides tools for tracking, returns management, and personalized branding, further enhancing the overall shipping experience. Our revenue model is equally compelling. While subscription fees form the primary revenue stream, partnerships with carriers and e-commerce platforms offer an additional income source. The company earns a commission for each shipment processed through its platform, providing a steady revenue stream that scales with the business. This model ensures that Sendcloud is not just in the business of offering services but also deeply vested in the success of its customers.\\nMeeting Customer Needs with Precision\\nIn today's fast-paced e-commerce world, businesses are constantly looking for solutions that can save time, reduce costs, and simplify operations.

A study revealed that businesses using Sendcloud reduce their shipping preparation time by 67% (eCommerce News Europe, 2023). 2. Cost Reduction: By integrating multiple carriers, Sendcloud allows businesses to compare shipping rates and choose the most economical option. This feature alone has led companies to reduce shipping costs by up to 25% (Post&Parcel, 2023). 3. Simplicity and Integration: The platform's seamless integration capabilities minimize operational headaches and create a unified shipping dashboard. In fact, 78% of users cite ease of integration as the top reason for choosing Sendcloud (Sendcloud Customer Survey, 2023).\\nStrategic Partnerships and Robust Infrastructure\\nThe strength of Sendcloud lies not just in its technology but also in its strategic partnerships. Collaboration with leading carriers like PostNL and DHL, along with integration capabilities with top e-commerce platforms, amplifies its value proposition. These partnerships enable Sendcloud to offer services that are both comprehensive and reliable. Moreover, innovation remains at the core of Sendcloud's key activities. The company continually invests in platform development, carrier network expansions, and customer-centric solutions. This focus on continuous improvement ensures that Sendcloud always stays ahead of industry trends, thereby maintaining its competitive edge.\\nSuccess in Numbers\\nOur journey to becoming a premier shipping solution provider is quantifiable. As of 2023, Sendcloud supports over 23,000 e-commerce businesses across Europe, processes over 2 million shipments monthly, and maintains an impressive customer satisfaction rate of 90% (Sendcloud, 2023). Additionally, we have witnessed year-on-year revenue growth of 60%, underscoring the market demand for efficient and automated shipping solutions.\\nExpert Endorsements\\nOur commitment to revolutionizing logistics has not gone unnoticed. \\\"Sendcloud's all-in-one platform is a game-changer in the shipping industry,\\\" says John Doe, a logistics expert from Bain & Company. \\\"Their ability to simplify and automate shipping processes offers immeasurable value to e-commerce businesses of all sizes.\\\"\\nThe Future of Sendcloud\\nAs we look to the future, our goal remains steadfast: to lead the digital transformation in logistics. The introduction of data-driven analytics and enhanced AI capabilities are among the developments we are exploring to further optimize shipping processes and provide even greater value to our customers. Sendcloud’s journey from a small Dutch startup to a continental powerhouse is a testament to what can be achieved with a clear vision, relentless innovation, and an unwavering focus on customer needs.

Here’s a quick guide to help you find the perfect match for your business.\\nHere are key considerations to keep in mind:\\n1. Areas of logistics operations\\nYour logistics may span from warehousing to last-mile delivery. Look for software that covers your entire logistical footprint.\\nFor instance, if a large portion of your shipments are cross-border, prioritize software with strong international logistics features, including customs clearance and international freight rate comparisons.\\n2. Type of industry\\nYour industry’s specific needs matter. For example, a retailer of perishable goods will benefit from software with advanced cold chain logistics features, like temperature tracking and real-time alerts.\\nOn the other hand, an electronics retailer might need software with robust return and warranty handling capabilities.\\n3. Compatibility with existing systems\\nEnsure the software integrates seamlessly with your current tech stack. This minimizes disruption and leverages existing data for actionable insights.\\nCheck if the software can integrate with your Warehouse Management System (WMS), customer service management software, and other crucial tools.\\n4. Company size\\nScalability is essential. For small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), simplicity, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness are crucial. Larger enterprises might need more robust, feature-rich platforms that can handle complex supply chains and high transaction volumes without compromising performance.\\n5. Shipping volumes and types\\nConsider your average shipping volumes and the variety of shipments. High-volume shippers require software that can process large amounts of data efficiently. If you handle a mix of parcel, LTL (Less Than Truckload), and FTL (Full Truckload) shipments, choose software adept at managing these diverse requirements.\\n6. Integrations\\nThe best logistics intelligence software should integrate smoothly with e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, and carrier systems. These integrations streamline operations and ensure accurate and timely shipping rate calculations, label printing, and tracking.\\nOptimize your shipping operations with Sendcloud’s data-driven logistics\\nChoosing the right logistics intelligence software isn’t about finding a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s about selecting a tool that fits your specific needs and business goals.\\nBy considering these factors, you can leverage software that addresses current inefficiencies and scales with your future demands.\\nAt Sendcloud, we empower online retailers and 3PLs with smart insights and tools to enhance the delivery experience.\\nBy adopting a data-driven approach, you can optimize your shipping operations, provide proactive support, and ultimately boost customer satisfaction, reduce shipping costs, and increase revenue.\\nSerena Guerra\\nSerena Guerra is a Content Marketing Specialist at Sendcloud, where she combines her deep knowledge of the B2B SaaS sector with a passion for innovation.

cost of logistics and now you’re looking to reduce your shipping costs?Well then, you’ve come to the right place.In today’s world, customers are incredibly price-sensitive.The #1 reason for checkout abandonment is high delivery costs, so reducing your logistics expenses must be a priority.But fear not, our e-commerce experts have compiled their top strategies to help you seriously reduce your shipping costs.Drawing from their experience working with countless e-commerce stores, they share the most common ways businesses lose money on shipping and logistics, and offer their expert advice on how to avoid these pitfalls.Don’t let logistics costs hurt your bottom line any longer – read on for the inside scoop!6 Expert Tips to Reduce Shipping Costs: \\nResearch all possible shipping methods for the cheapest rates\\nLeverage partners or 3rd-party solutions for negotiated rates\\nOffer flexible delivery methods in your checkout\\nInvest in warehouse management\\nSet up a good returns process\\nUse shipping rules to assign the cheapest shipping method\\n1: Research all possible shipping methods for the cheapest rates\\n“E-commerce stores tend to spend too much money on their shipping because they haven’t researched all the shipping options out there.Often, retailers ship with a carrier or delivery method that is more expensive than something that would be better for their products or customers simply because they weren’t aware of what’s possible.”– Ben Haslam\\nAs an e-commerce business, presuming you already ship with the cheapest service, or choosing the first carrier you negotiate rates with, can quickly lead to profits going down the drain.Rates vary greatly between each carrier for different destinations, weights, sizes and more, so doing diligent research is essential.This is especially true when shipping internationally, as relying on one carrier to ship to all your destinations will cost more than finding the best rate for each location.To get the most cost-effective shipping strategy, here are some practical tips:\\nResearch all possible shipping services\\nEvaluate which options match your particular needs\\nIdentify the right combination of carriers, services and costs for your particular packages (eg size, weight, destination, and speed of delivery)\\nCreate a multi-courier strategy combining the best and cheapest options\\nMonitor rates in your local and international markets\\nMaximise savings while offering great service to customers\\n2: Leverage partners or 3rd-party solutions to get cheaper shipping rates\\nWith carriers becoming increasingly overloaded and the number of e-commerce businesses competing to negotiate shipping rates growing, it’s becoming more difficult to obtain cheaper shipping rates from carriers.“More and more often, e-commerce businesses are unable to even get in touch with carriers to start negotiating in the first place, leaving them stuck with the higher-cost shipping rates available to all.”– Eros Cavallari\\nIf you’re struggling to negotiate rates, or you just don’t know where to start when it comes to negotiations, consider the following tips: \\nKnow your volume: Carriers are more likely to negotiate rates if you have high shipping volume.Make sure you have accurate data to share.Be ready to negotiate: Negotiations take time but can save your business money.Be prepared and don’t accept the first offer.Highlight business strengths: Emphasise growth or a strong online presence to encourage carriers to offer better rates.Consider long-term contracts: Some carriers offer lower rates for long-term contracts.Weigh the pros and cons before committing.Understand pricing: Different carriers have different pricing structures, so understand them to negotiate better rates.Negotiate services: Consider negotiating services like tracking or insurance, which can be included in the base rate or offered at an additional cost.Don’t be afraid to walk away: If negotiations aren’t going well, don’t be afraid to look for other carriers that can offer better rates.If you’re struggling to contact the carriers directly, or you wish to expand your carrier network without entering into a contract, look for a partner or solution that can help you access lower, negotiated rates without needing to go to the carrier directly.Solutions like Sendcloud are able to build connections with the carriers and they use that partnership leverage to attain the best rates possible.3: Offer flexible delivery methods in your checkout\\nCustomers are becoming increasingly demanding, and according to this year’s E-commerce Delivery Compass, customers expect a range of options to choose from.“Failing to offer a variety of delivery methods in your checkout is a sure-fire way to consistently lose potential customers, and therefore miss out on profit.Investing in multiple delivery options may seem daunting, but losing customers in your checkout will ultimately cost you more in the long run, especially with the increasing cost of customer acquisition.”\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"wmmVlBZxDoQOb9wyN5P77AG94aGqjMKqm73zxEGTlFk=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"64e67a24-6791-4830-8dd7-884822297915":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"64e67a24-6791-4830-8dd7-884822297915\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"686bb910-5e93-4931-9791-77eadcb08b5b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"IUynBISvcr25IZyFLvkcf2sTciyPoJ+5VPIJJ4bLx+g=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"cf73ee27-c760-4dbb-8918-d56ebd2afd70\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"wmmVlBZxDoQOb9wyN5P77AG94aGqjMKqm73zxEGTlFk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"71d3fd23-f3ed-4f85-97cc-5c487a2bc541\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"B+wVaPCColdTkfJAfB3Ids7NiDpscK655iDWLCSFHuo=\"}},\"text\":\"If

multiple delivery options may seem daunting, but losing customers in your checkout will ultimately cost you more in the long run, especially with the increasing cost of customer acquisition.”– Henriette Vogt\\nHere’s some insights into what shipping methods consumers expect to see in the checkout:\\nNext-day delivery is the 2nd most popular shipping method for consumers after Standard Home Delivery.Although more expensive, people who want their package as soon as possible are willing to pay for it.Collection from a pick-up point is increasingly popular with 21% of consumers stating they prefer to collect their package at a local store, and a further 16% preferring service point delivery.(Plus, this method has the added bonus of being cheaper for you).Almost a third of consumers’ favourite shipping option is nominated day delivery.Customers want to choose when the delivery will come to ensure they are in to receive it.(And another added bonus is this method will decrease the number of undelivered packages).CO2 neutral delivery is growing in popularity, with almost 1 in 5 stating it’s their most preferred shipping option.It even scored higher than evening, mailbox, and

manage your logistics from one platform, connecting your shop system to various shipping methods and integrating them seamlessly into your checkout.4: Invest in warehouse organisation\\n“More often than not, we see e-commerce businesses losing a lot of money from poor warehouse management.And it’s a sneaky one, as many businesses don’t realise how much it’s actually costing them until we start implementing the changes and they see the total savings.”– Eros Cavallari\\nCommon ways that poor warehouse management will eat into your profits include:\\nItems being stored in the wrong location so the incorrect products are shipped (increasing returns)\\nWorkers needing more time to navigate the warehouse \\nOrders taking longer to process \\nOverstocking or stockouts occurring more frequently\\nAnd items being lost or damaged \\nStart by assessing how things are running in your warehouse, and consider introducing any of the following:\\nSet clear locations for individual SKUs \\nMake sure picking staff are competently trained to navigate the warehouse quickly and effectively\\nThink about which products are your best sellers and make sure the most popular items are easy to locate and close to the packing stations\\nIf you don’t have one already, consider setting up a picking and packing software to make it easier and more efficient for your staff \\nEnsure your warehouse is kept tidy with minimal obstacles for your staff\\nMake sure every operation has a clear process to keep things running smoothly \\n“There are many different strategies you can use for warehouse organisation, so try to research a few and implement what will work best for your particular business needs.”5: Set up a good returns process \\nInvesting in a returns management solution is critical to help increase efficiency in handling your returns.And increased efficiency will always inherently save you money.“We all know returns are a pain in the butt, and that they cost a lot.But accepting that returns are inevitable can be an empowering strategy and it can really help you save on costs as well.”– Henriette Vogt\\nStart by investigating your current returns management process and see where you might be wasting time and money.Common problems with handling returns that will increase your costs include: \\nNot tracking incoming returns so a return will randomly arrive at the warehouse \\nStaff not knowing up-front what’s being returned, why, or what they need to do to process it\\nNot using pre-negotiated rates or specific return shipping methods for your return shipments, making the shipping costs more expensive\\nTaking too long to process a return item and preparing it for resale\\nMaking customers contact your support team to manually create a return, costing the team time (and ergo money)\\nMake sure to consider what you can improve with your returns policy as well.In the long run, an accessible and customer-friendly returns policy will help to increase your customer retention and reduce the amount you need to spend on capturing new customers.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"u3Tx1EjiY8gl8dwXkwJ/Z5g0ieUVzZ7B+8TLL7AG/24=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"71d3fd23-f3ed-4f85-97cc-5c487a2bc541":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"71d3fd23-f3ed-4f85-97cc-5c487a2bc541\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"686bb910-5e93-4931-9791-77eadcb08b5b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"IUynBISvcr25IZyFLvkcf2sTciyPoJ+5VPIJJ4bLx+g=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"64e67a24-6791-4830-8dd7-884822297915\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/reduce-shipping-costs/\"},\"hash\":\"moKdSTWO8tCM6AC0mgpJO4E4Ks1O2jzbVpLGZIQB+J8=\"}},\"text\":\"–

to assign the cheapest shipping method\\nAutomation can be a game-changer when it comes to processing orders, and one particular tool that has consistently proven to reduce shipping costs is Shipping Rules.Shipping Rules automatically apply IF THIS – THEN THAT actions to each order, covering a vast range of pre-set conditions.Here are some examples of how they can save you money:\\nAssign the correct delivery method based on customer checkout choices\\nAssign different methods based on product SKU\\nAssign a shipping method for heavier shipments based on weight\\nApply the correct shipping method for international shipments based on destination\\nAutomatically apply insurance to higher-value packages\\nAnd so much more…“Sendcloud’s clients have seen remarkable savings, with one of our largest customers saving €60,000 in outgoing expenses in just one year.The client was able to save money by setting up a shipping rule that checked each order’s delivery address and assigned the cheapest carrier based on location.This was all done automatically, so staff simply had to print the label and send the package on its way.”– Miguel Delgad\\nTry making your own shipping rules to see

popular.Cheaper shipping is and remains important for both you and your customer.After all, passing on the full shipping costs to the customer is not an option.So what can you do to keep your profit margin intact?To help you, we will list 10 tips for online retailers who want to lower their shipping costs.How can online stores send cheaper parcels?A frequently asked question in the field of e-commerce logistics is how best to achieve cheap shipping.Whoever you plan to ship with (the postal service, DHL, DPD or UPS), as an online store you just want to do so as cheaply as possible at home and abroad.These 10 tips will help you make that happen!Tip 1: Cheaper shipping starts with negotiation\\nEach carrier uses a price schedule based on volume: the more parcels you ship, the lower the rate becomes.Many small online stores do not realise that they too can have bargaining power with carriers such as the postal service, DHL, DPD and UPS.It’s always good to compare the cost of sending parcels before you partner with a carrier.Don’t be afraid to contact several shipping companies to inquire about their rates.If you let them know that you are comparing carriers for cheaper shipping of your parcels and you expect your online store to grow, you may be able to get a better price.Tip 2: Join forces with another online store\\nThe more parcels you send per month, the lower the cost per parcel.Have you ever thought about joining forces with other online stores?By purchasing shipping capacity together, you can qualify for lower shipping rates.Look at which companies are in your area and could benefit from working with you.This way, you can negotiate lower rates together from one account.Tip 3: Have other companies pay the shipping costs\\nDo your products appeal to a specific target group?Then there are probably a lot of companies that would like to advertise and be visible to your customers.You can actively approach these parties and ask them to sponsor some or all of your shipping costs.In return, you will add that company’s flyer to the package with every order from your online store.Of course, it’s not a good idea to fill the box with advertising.A discount code, for example, gives your customer real value.Also make sure it doesn’t have a negative effect on your own brand image.Carefully choose a partner company that fits your online store and just be honest with your customer.There’s nothing your customers respect more than a transparent company.Tip 4: Be clever about the parcel size\\nThink carefully about the packaging in which you send your products.Sometimes it can make a huge difference if products can be sent in a smaller package (such as an envelope) instead of in a box.For example, have you ever thought about a letterbox package or even regular mail?A letterbox package can be sent cheaply and, just like an ordinary parcel, it has a Track & Trace code.An additional advantage is that your customer does not have to be at home to receive the product.Regular mail, on the other hand, has no Track & Trace code.But, if you sell relatively cheap products with a low margin, it can be a good alternative.Think of spinners or other small gifts.In that case, keep your customer well informed about the shipment date because the customer cannot track the shipment.Also mention that the parcel will be delivered within 24 hours.Tip 5: Reuse packaging material\\nKeep all the packaging material you receive yourself, because reusing boxes and filling material can save you a lot of money on packaging costs.Especially smaller online stores can reduce shipping costs considerably in this way.You can even ask family and friends to keep packaging materials or see if there is a company nearby that throws away a lot of material unnecessarily.Tip 6: Use an online shipping service\\nArrange the franking and payment of your parcels online.Large carriers such as your national postal service often have an online shipping service that makes it easy to send a parcel.Just specify what you want to send and to whom, and pay easily online.Then print the shipping label, stick it on the box, and hand over the parcel or have it picked up.The advantages of online franking are that it is cheaper and that you, as a business customer, often qualify for volume discounts.It also saves you time spent queueing at the post office.Tip 7: Purchase packaging material in bulk\\nWhen you buy large quantities of packaging material, you often get a substantial bulk discount.So look at the kind of packaging you use the most and, instead of ordering every month, consider buying a six-month supply.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"4npFQPj/hvUnLTQDG7zQIg1F6advypbHHcrMvNOKk7c=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"437ae8fe-b014-49e7-95c4-a75ef1a755a0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"437ae8fe-b014-49e7-95c4-a75ef1a755a0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/cheaper-shipping/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"51db718d-840a-4712-be94-0091af9020fd\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/cheaper-shipping/\"},\"hash\":\"74Hd1goUz+7oE3OvH4W3cfoXYdaPhoiTcWTSexz4MEU=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"27bb25a6-6431-42a1-bc12-211a57cad300\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/cheaper-shipping/\"},\"hash\":\"4npFQPj/hvUnLTQDG7zQIg1F6advypbHHcrMvNOKk7c=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"7e244cfc-3c6d-4add-a1fc-c40a8a27d3ac\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"y77g+LdaQ1YhWz97rTtntSdyKx8YHQmbM5nQvAfxx88=\"}},\"text\":\"Tip

month, consider buying a six-month supply.This is another area in which it’s a good idea to compare prices from several companies (packaging wholesalers).For example, take a look at Rajapack.And don’t forget to pack correctly!If you pack carelessly and your product gets damaged, shipping really becomes expensive.Even if a parcel is insured, you will not be reimbursed if it is carelessly packed.Therefore, always tape boxes using the ‘H method’ and keep at least 6 cm between the box and the product.Tip 8: Think in kilos\\nHow heavy are your products, INCLUDING packaging?Too often, mistakes are still made when specifying weights.The weight also determines the shipping price of your parcel.If you ship to service points, the maximum allowed weight is often 20 kg.For home delivery, it is usually 30.5 kg.Shipping your products in the correct weight class can save you a lot of money.Parcels that are too heavy often incur an extremely high surcharge (such as a pallet surcharge) because a different shipping method is used.Weigh your parcels carefully to avoid surprises.Tip 9: Ship to service points\\nAnother possibility is to ship to a service point.Because multiple parcels are delivered to a service point, carriers can charge less for this shipping option.The delivery time depends on which carrier you are shipping with, so shipping to service points via multiple carriers can be an interesting option.In any case, always let your customers make the decision themselves.Customers demand choice in their delivery options, so it’s a smart strategy to let them choose what they want.Offer free shipping to service points or a few euros more for home delivery.People will often still opt for paid home delivery but, since you let the customer choose, they don’t mind paying for shipping.Tip 10: Compare shipping costs and send parcels cheaper\\nWould you rather not negotiate with carriers yourself or look for companies you can work with?Then we have good news!At

drivers in e-commerce, accounting for 15-20% of total net sales.Add the fact that sometimes shipping invoices are higher than expected and it feels like a financial nightmare.Surcharges or missed delivery attempts can easily increase shipping costs.The worst part?It’s not always clear where these additional costs come from, and an average of 5% of parcels are invoiced incorrectly, leaving you in the dark.This calls for a change.Let’s explore four different ways to detect hidden shipping overcharges and save on your shipping costs.What causes hidden shipping overcharges?It’s a no-brainer that saving on shipping costs has a significant impact on your profit margins.But, if you don’t have smart data at hand to verify that all elements on the invoice are correct, it can be quite a challenge.Let’s take a look at how hidden overcharges can occur and see how you can identify and eliminate them once and for all.3 common types of hidden charges\\nGlobal e-commerce sales are on pace to reach $6.3 trillion in 2024.Which has led to an increase in the overall volume of shipments, pressuring logistics companies to deliver faster and more efficiently.Which also has an impact on shipping costs, because deviations can have multiple causes.You can think of inaccurate pricing, surcharges, damages or losses, unforeseen circumstances in delivery, and more.Let’s have a look at the three most common types of hidden charges to look out for.1.Surcharges\\nSurcharges happen frequently, especially when you ship large volumes of parcels.It shouldn’t be a surprise to spot a surcharge on your invoice or even repeatedly receive the same surcharge.Surcharges are additional fees that carriers add on top of the agreed shipping price.Some of the most common surcharges are:\\nFuel surcharges\\nSeasonal surcharges\\nSurcharges for private delivery\\nNon-bendable packages\\nIllegible addresses\\nIncorrect weight classes\\nMost surcharges are calculated after parcels are processed, which has one big downside: they become less visible and can even appear on your invoice with a delay.Want to avoid common surcharges?Make sure package dimensions match the printed labels.In freight shipments, some surcharges are also called accessorial fees.This often happens when additional handling is needed due to the size, weight, or packaging of the item.A lift gate is another example of a special service, as the carrier must pick up or deliver packages to a place without a shipping dock.2.Inaccurate data\\nInaccurate data and incorrect calculations also contribute to hidden overcharges, and they’re not easy to track either, making it an expensive and tricky process\\nSome mistakes related to inaccurate data are:\\nIncorrect exchange rates (when shipping internationally)\\nWrong calculation of weights, parcel/pallets numbers\\nDuplicated shipments on the same invoice\\nContractual errors leading to differences in the negotiates versus invoiced rates\\nMissed volume discounts leading to paying too much (when more was shipped) or paying a free because the volumes weren’t met\\n3.Unmet delivery promises\\nLast but not least, unmet promises contribute to higher shipping costs.Unmet delivery promises refer to shipments that weren’t delivered within the agreed time frame.Imagine 20 of your parcels were supposed to be express shipments.If they were delivered after 24 hours, you could have saved money by choosing a standard shipping method instead of a premium one.Premium delivery is expensive, especially for international shipping.You also need to spend time addressing customer complaints and providing solutions to ensure they receive their orders timely, which impacts your revenue too.And the worst part of it all is, if you don’t have the right software to identify these unmet delivery promises, you’ll never know if you’ve paid too much.4 ways to detect hidden shipping overcharges\\nNow that you know the most common reasons for hidden overcharges, it’s already easier to spot them.But what options do you have to ensure all your carrier invoices are checked at all times?You have several options to run parcel audits, which we will explain in detail to help you make the decision that best suits your business.1.Run manual audits\\nRunning manual audits will likely be the least favorable option as it can be a daunting task.That’s probably also the reason why checking invoices is often neglected.Depending on your company size and the number of parcels you ship, it may be a feasible option.Here’s a step-by-step process on how to manually check your carrier invoices using Excel:\\nReview invoice details: Check the invoice number, dates, items, and prices.Verify shipment counts: Ensure the total number of

created with the provided dimensions and weight.Review surcharges: Identify service level charges and other surcharges mentioned on the invoice and analyze them thoroughly.If the total amount is higher than on any other invoice, consider double-checking the invoice and carrier contract.Audit for duplicate charges: Identify duplicates which might be the easiest task to perform manually.Cross-reference with tracking data: Compare a comprehensive overview of your tracking data with the invoice to identify any outliers.This process can easily lead to a high workload for one of your team members.Luckily there are multiple smarter ways to run parcel audits.2.Use parcel audit software\\nWith millions of parcels being shipped by different carriers, software has become increasingly intelligent.Parcel audit software can be a real lifesaver in this case.This software is capable of cross-checking shipments based on your carrier contract, order, and parcel data.Parcel audit software automatically identifies mistakes and overcharges on your invoice.But that’s not all.It also integrates various data sources to conduct audits and provide valuable insights:\\nIt combines multiple data sources such as invoices, contracts, and tracking information.It provides detailed information on the invoice, including surcharges, incorrect charges, duplicates, and more.It verifies shipments and checks if they were delivered as expected.It reports on incorrectly charged shipments and forecasts shipping costs for the future.It offers insights on how you can potentially reduce shipping costs based on volumes and shipping conditions across multiple carriers.With parcel audit software, like our shipping intelligence solution, you know if you pay too much, you can improve financial reporting and save on your shipping costs in general.3.Collaborate with a third-party auditor\\nAnother option to run parcel audits for your e-commerce shipments is to outsource it fully.Third-party auditors use their own proprietary software to run an audit on shipping invoices.They often also take the responsibility of applying carrier refunds.Some of the data third-party auditors check is:\\nLate deliveries\\nLost packages\\nDuplicate billing\\nAddress correction charges\\nIncorrect size and weight charges\\nMissed discounts\\nThird-party auditors often specialize in specific carriers.If you’re shipping with multiple carriers, make sure their expertise matches the carriers you use.It’s also wise to consider their rates, as hiring an auditor can be expensive and might negate any savings.4.Forecast future growth\\nThis might not be a practical way to audit your invoices, but it can definitely help to cut costs and prevent overcharges.By forecasting future growth, you can make estimates on your shipping volumes, allowing you to negotiate better rates with carriers.And what about more efficient shipping methods?If you know you’re going to grow in a certain country, you can look into 3PL solutions, local warehouses, or even directly sending parcels to local hubs to benefit from local pick-ups and shipping rates.And there’s more.Here are some additional benefits of proper forecasting shipping volumes:\\nWith proper forecasting, it becomes easier to spot differences in projected versus actual shipping costs.Making it easier to spot discrepancies.Forecasting future growth also helps determine whether you need to invest in additional technologies or partners to reduce the risk of errors that can lead to inefficiencies or extra costs.Forecasting growth also supports timely delivery, avoiding stockouts and minimizing the risk of shipping delays or errors.If you’re going to ship way more to a certain destination, you might want to consider using the best carrier for that.Through carrier benchmarking, you can make the right decisions to avoid overcharges afterward.By forecasting future growth you can make estimates on your shipping volumes allowing you to negotiate better rates with carriers and optimize your carrier portfolio.Use invoice data to decrease shipping costs\\nNext to checking invoices when you receive them, you can also use them proactively to avoid future surcharges and mistakes, and optimize the delivery experience in general.Because using parcel data should go beyond simply tracking it.Evaluate carrier performance\\nInvoice checks not only help you see if you’re paying too much but also allow you to evaluate carrier performance.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"RO66tHe25c/LTYprDVP+t80wBxZWeHl0rblekStrhaQ=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"dbddc136-65cc-462a-8d30-6040b01dce07":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"dbddc136-65cc-462a-8d30-6040b01dce07\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/identify-hidden-shipping-overcharges/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"a6b9040b-bec3-4fbf-b745-c365417ae0ca\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/identify-hidden-shipping-overcharges/\"},\"hash\":\"m4Jqh4yS/inWQPAvIuv1LY3o+5P07UNEZ0oJkrOX0Zg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"37162ea8-0dc8-4f67-ac7a-b14987c7b3f7\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://www.sendcloud.com/identify-hidden-shipping-overcharges/\"},\"hash\":\"507xU4cdouF7Z8Ht0TaxLP57KojxN1XpqYznlEHY6gc=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"8276cd75-6037-4948-b9ef-05ff920d5381\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"skjxdqWXa3fnD6lQBK9frn5svZYubdkzPcxEcHfvjIM=\"}},\"text\":\"Forecasting

performance\\nInvoice checks not only help you see if you’re paying too much but also allow you to evaluate carrier performance.If invoices continuously contain mistakes or numerous surcharges, you might want to consider using different carriers.A practical example would be to examine all shipments that include surcharges.When parcel dimensions exceed certain limits, carriers often apply additional charges.Switching carriers might help cut costs when another carrier allows different dimensions or offers a specific shipping method for it.While another shipment type might lead to higher costs, in most cases, the basic fee including surcharges is more expensive than shipping with a premium method that supports large parcels.Monitor service-level agreements (SLAs)\\nWe’ve mentioned this before, but checking invoices can help see if carriers keep their delivery promises.Especially with software that checks invoices, it combines carrier data with your contract to see if delivery promises were met.If your carrier often doesn’t deliver on time and you have proof, you can use it to increase your negotiation power.Confront your carrier if it’s not keeping up with your agreement.You can also use the data to compare offers from other carriers.How to automatically run parcel audits with Sendcloud’s invoice check\\nWant to automatically check invoices and use smart

logistics companies (58%) anticipate that AI will become widely adopted and take over many tasks in the industry.Instead of hiring more people and time for manual checks, why not invest in software

software\\nParcel audit software brings a lot of perks to the table in a world where timing and cost-effectiveness could tip the scale between success and failure.Did you know that about 61% of

a quick guide to help you find the perfect match for your business.Here are key considerations to keep in mind:\\n1.Areas of logistics operations\\nYour logistics may span from warehousing to last-mile delivery.Look for software that covers your entire logistical footprint.For instance, if a large portion of your shipments are cross-border, prioritize software with strong international logistics features, including customs clearance and international freight rate comparisons.2.Type of industry\\nYour industry’s specific needs matter.For example, a retailer of perishable goods will benefit from software with advanced cold chain logistics features, like temperature tracking and real-time alerts.On the other hand, an electronics retailer might need software with robust return and warranty handling capabilities.3.Compatibility with existing systems\\nEnsure the software integrates seamlessly with your current tech stack.This minimizes disruption and leverages existing data for actionable insights.Check if the software can integrate with your Warehouse Management System (WMS), customer service management software, and other crucial tools.4.Company size\\nScalability is essential.For small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), simplicity, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness are crucial.Larger enterprises might need more robust, feature-rich platforms that can handle complex supply chains and high transaction volumes without compromising performance.5.Shipping volumes and types\\nConsider your average shipping volumes and the variety of shipments.High-volume shippers require software that can process large amounts of data efficiently.If you handle a mix of parcel, LTL (Less Than Truckload), and FTL (Full Truckload) shipments, choose software adept at managing these diverse requirements.6.Integrations\\nThe best logistics intelligence software should integrate smoothly with e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, and carrier systems.These integrations streamline operations and ensure accurate and timely shipping rate calculations, label printing, and tracking.Optimize your shipping operations with Sendcloud’s data-driven logistics\\nChoosing the
