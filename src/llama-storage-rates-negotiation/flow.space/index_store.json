costs higher while innovation is shaping the warehouse faster than ever.Michael Zimmerman, Alberto Oca and Akash Agrawal · May 8, 2019 ·\nThe unabated rise in distribution costs and resulting profit squeeze has become prominent in corporate commentary on financial results.Retailers such as Home Depot and Target are blaming high supply chain costs for margin deteriorations, amplified by the move to online sales as digital revenues grow 20-40% annually for most major retailers.The trend of margin deterioration due to rising distribution cost is not just limited to retailers but extends to industrials, chemicals, automotive and others.Warehouse vacancy rates continue to flirt with all-time lows\nAccording to CBRE, industrial-and-logistics real estate vacancy rates are near historic lows at nearly 4% with demand exceeding supply for last 32 out of 33 quarters.Warehouse rental rates have been rising 5-6% per year on average, far above commercial real estate rate increase of 2-3%.Figure 1\nStacking factors (indicating how many pallets can be stacked on top of each other) are trending down due to greater need for pick profile flexibility driven by smaller sized e-commerce orders vs. full pallet orders by big box retailers.This is leading to greater needs for additional warehouse locations or overflow spaces when rates are already high and supply tight.Companies are therefore increasingly looking for ways to better use vertical space through multi-level racking investments to support single-unit picking.Warehousing employment cost index is accelerating at a speed not seen since the recovery period after the Great Recession, due to a shortage of warehouse workers and minimum wage increases\nAs per BLS, overall employment cost index jumped by 3% in 2018 (see chart below), whereas for transportation and warehousing workers, the corresponding jump was even higher at 3.5%.Figure 2\nSource: Bureau of labor Statistics (BLS) Employment Cost Index Percent Change y-o-y (Dec 2018)\nLabor and staff typically constitute 40-60% of the warehouse operations cost, so changes in the employment cost index correlate tightly with warehouse rates and contractual price adjustments.Minimum wage increases are pushing up wages for all low skilled labor.California minimum wage will go up from $10 in 2017 to $15 in 2023 which translates to a nearly 7% annual increase.Proposed legislation in other states indicates that the minimum wage could approach $15 in the next 3-5 years.Demand for highly skilled labor is accelerating in warehouses and employee requirements have evolved as service levels, performance and efficiency become paramount.According to Logistics Management both logistics salaries and the number of functions that warehouse staff are being asked to do have risen.BLS reported separation rates for “Transportation, warehousing and utilities” have been consistently going up for last 5 years from 38% in 2014 to 44.2% in 2018.While this article looks closely at technology innovation in warehousing, one simple area to work on is the boosting of employee working conditions and morale.Figure 3\nTariff uncertainty creates planning nightmare\nRetailers pulled forward orders in Q4 2018 to beat tariff deadlines but that meant high levels of inventory and warehouses at record capacity.Although this could be seen as a one-off event, the ongoing trade dispute resulted in companies scrambling to re-plan their supply chains, often at high logistics cost as they ran out of storage space.Impact – Acceleration in warehousing costs, focus on efficiency and innovation\nAlthough e-commerce is adding complexity to warehouse operations, shorter delivery lead times and deployment of inventory across the supply chain, including the last mile, have become the norm.Third party logistics providers are now quoting 10-20% rate increases for standard warehousing activities such as receiving, storage, delivery, returns, etc. Increased complexity and rising rates pose a multifaceted issue for logistics sourcing teams.Those lacking procurement discipline and a proactive bid planning roadmap are struggling due to an inability to leverage market competition or explore alternative solutions.A focus on emerging technologies has increased but traditional firms underinvesting to improve logistics efficiency are seeing limits to cost cutting initiatives and a sharper rise in warehousing costs.An alternative or complement to a robust bid strategy is a good collaborative supplier development policy.Even though the onus is on 3PLs to invest in new technologies to improve productivity, partnering approaches and assurances involving cost-benefit sharing as part of the shipper-supplier relationship encourages them to invest.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"xkyPVQNiQchJsbs7xbnByuw4TDcOFAIX8iEf96lEWHc="},"87ab5de3-06b2-4922-898b-0d6b99eb0364":{"id_":"87ab5de3-06b2-4922-898b-0d6b99eb0364","metadata":{"url":"https://www.scmr.com/article/the_perfect_warehousing_storm"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55ce2003-073b-45b8-8535-f66c8da16c03","metadata":{"url":"https://www.scmr.com/article/the_perfect_warehousing_storm"},"hash":"l5uzZzC2mrzkhzBCnRlgQ3Uh8RT5hzpBT9ap1Zfmsk8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a84ab069-b034-44e6-b9b0-19c419e28a30","metadata":{"url":"https://www.scmr.com/article/the_perfect_warehousing_storm"},"hash":"xkyPVQNiQchJsbs7xbnByuw4TDcOFAIX8iEf96lEWHc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3112ee2d-b750-47a8-99f3-a8d4652b957c","metadata":{},"hash":"ft1fN+g9PDaBGcV10QmSHUIbI+9myEu4FXeiyDWmQvA="}},"text":"Third

transportation and fleet focused (e.g.real time route optimization, uberization of freight, autonomous trucks) but interesting concepts in warehousing and technology-driven productivity initiatives have emerged.Traditional warehousing operations are evolving dramatically with the help of technology innovators and logistics leaders must stay on top of these developments.Figure 4\nSource: A.T.Kearney research\nPop-up warehousing start-ups such as Flexe, Flow Space, Ware2go have emerged in the market, first to support e-commerce business and peak season demand but also as a safety valve for large shippers and 3PLs seeking flexibility.Major retailers such as Walmart.com, Walgreens, Staples and Bath & Body Works are already working with these and other startups.Also known as on-demand warehousing, benefits such as no start-up costs, short implementation lead times of 3-4 weeks and flexibility to pay for short term usage outweigh the disadvantage of paying higher unit costs than typical long-term contracts.Retail-to-warehouse conversion concept is also taking off with MH&L (Material Handling & Logistics Group) reporting empty stores and shopping malls being converted into distribution centers.Brick-and-mortar store closures is a key enabler of this concept.Micro-fulfillment centers which are located in urban areas near consumers with a fraction of the size of a typical store, are being tested to support fast inexpensive grocery delivery.CommonSense Robotics, an Israeli micro-fulfillment startup has launched autonomous sorting and shipping capabilities to prepare orders in less than three minutes.According to CSR, retailers incur a loss of $5 to $15 on every manually picked online grocery order.In fall 2018, CB Insights reported that grocery retailer Albertsons partnered with warehousing robotics startup Takeoff Technologies to pilot a small urban fulfillment center.Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are more advanced than older AGVs (Automated guided vehicles) and finding adoption in warehouses that require faster, smarter, more flexible robots that are easy to set up and require less capital investment.AGVs have been around for decades but primarily used to support operations around production lines such as transportation of raw materials, semi-finished goods and finished goods between manufacturing and attached plant buffers.AGVs are being tested in large warehouses where repetitive tasks dominate but manually operated forklifts are still preferred for smaller operations.AMRs are more advanced as they can use dynamic navigation instead of being restricted to fixed routes and operate safely in an environment of workers and forklifts.Using AI-driven software, for instance, inVia Robotics’ Picker robots autonomously retrieve and move goods throughout warehouses as part of the order fulfillment process.Meanwhile, in October 2018, Honeywell announced a strategic collaboration with Fetch Robotics to fulfill growing volumes of e-commerce orders.Box packaging automation and robots have been mainly used at the end of manufacturing assembly lines and but still in nascent stages when it comes to automation in warehouse and fulfillment centers.Collaborative Robots (Cobots) have enabled a step change in pick productivity and help warehouses scale in peak seasons without the need to add proportionate number of warehouse workers.XPO and Geodis have started using Cobots at several locations to mimic zone picking.Cobots minimize travel for warehouse workers by making the journey from pick zone to pack station, clustering picking and allowing hands free scanning as workers don't need to carry a scanner.Locus, 6 River Systems, Fetch Robotics and NextShift Robotics are most active in this space.Autonomous drones for stock counting have started finding their way into warehouses to automate the inventory management function.Drones require use of RFID technology to track the data and feed it into the warehouse management system.In August 2018, Walmart's EVP of Logistics joined PINC's board of directors.PINC is the leading provider of aerial inventory robots (drones) for digital inventory solutions.Drones use optics technology along with autonomous navigation features and cloud orchestrated platform to locate and scan inventory.The core difficulty is identifying where the inventory is and a lot of research is focused on enhancing navigation and inventory identification capabilities.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5lCBSqAyOm59OH/fx3xSU9Hpr+Q2plIdLtT+RtWpJls="},"3112ee2d-b750-47a8-99f3-a8d4652b957c":{"id_":"3112ee2d-b750-47a8-99f3-a8d4652b957c","metadata":{"url":"https://www.scmr.com/article/the_perfect_warehousing_storm"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55ce2003-073b-45b8-8535-f66c8da16c03","metadata":{"url":"https://www.scmr.com/article/the_perfect_warehousing_storm"},"hash":"l5uzZzC2mrzkhzBCnRlgQ3Uh8RT5hzpBT9ap1Zfmsk8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"87ab5de3-06b2-4922-898b-0d6b99eb0364","metadata":{"url":"https://www.scmr.com/article/the_perfect_warehousing_storm"},"hash":"HFNlVfJZIv3KuWCQV4PdaWhvdb6EkReuOBTxgudch2E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"299ae833-9b47-4a67-bb8e-20657749fcf3","metadata":{},"hash":"2gf4uyArNb1sGavUwct5ZIReXvZOgYwb8vdAU6515vk="}},"text":"XPO

test, pilot and roll out, and does not solve near term cost challenges.Most wireless devices and solutions rely on cloud-based platforms and an IoT (Internet of Things) sensor network for WMS integration.Technology is not just relevant to automation technologies but also to implementation of new warehouse concepts such as on demand warehousing.It requires the ability to quickly connect a forward deployed location as another zone in the WMS and necessary infrastructure needs to be in place.Digitization of supply chain and warehousing thus requires a more holistic view of system architecture and support tools for it to work seamlessly rather than simply introducing the latest technology and innovation within the four walls.The key challenge facing logistics managers is how best to contain rising distribution costs in the near term while planning for long term productivity gains.Companies were not fully prepared for sudden increase in warehousing costs in 2018.Now they are trying to build agility in their supply chains through flexible assets and strategic partnerships, not only to get closer to customers but also to react quickly to changing market conditions without paying inflated rates.While pressure may drop as the business cycle turns, the structural drivers of high warehousing costs are here to stay, think shift towards e-commerce or home delivery of nearly all consumer products and further minimum wage increases.Logistics executives who prepare to address these challenges are far more likely to succeed.Michael Zimmerman is a partner in the

practitioners at the Chinese e-commerce company, Jing Dong.309 surveys based on questionnaires were gathered using stratified snowball sampling.They were then encoded and examined through descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and regression techniques.The outcomes indicated that roughly 33 % of the organization's logistics professionals understand the beneficial effects of logistics operations on the environment, and an equivalent proportion comprehended the significance of sustainable development.Additionally, the classifications of logistics operations and years of industry expertise significantly have influenced various aspects of green logistics technology, standards, and certification.The research also has indicated that the acceptance of green logistics technology is contingent on the backgrounds and classifications of the company's logistics experts.This suggests that Jing Dong should strengthen the implementation of relevant logistics policies and raise awareness among logistics practitioners regarding green logistics technology, standards, and certification.Previous article\nNext article\nKeywords\nLogisticsGreen logistics technologyGreen logistics certification and standardsEnvironmentSustainability\nIntroduction\nOver the past few years, there has been a growing apprehension regarding climate change, the release of greenhouse gases, and pollution.Given its reliance on fossil fuels and extensive transportation, the logistics sector has emerged as a significant contributor to environmental challenges (EPA, 2022, Zhang et al., 2022).According to research, the transport and logistics sector contributes about 24 % of global CO2 emissions (Ritchie, 2020).By 2050, the European Environment Agency predicts that without strong and effective action, global logistics will account for 40 % of global CO2 emissions (Lükewille, 2021).Green logistics technologies have attracted the attention of stakeholders who are interested in promoting environmental sustainability.These stakeholders include logistics professionals, business owners, policymakers, academics, and consumers (Champion, 2022).Green logistics technology involves the use of innovative technologies such as electric vehicles, alternative fuels, and smart logistics systems to reduce carbon emissions and increase efficiency.Green logistics are sustainable policies aimed at reducing the environmental impact of these activities, thus attaining a harmonious equilibrium between economic, environmental, and societal objectives (Liu, Zhang, Liu, Wang, & Wang, 2019, EPA, 2022).In China, the expansion of the logistics sector encounters comparable environmental issues.As per the information disclosed by the Chinese Federation of Logistics and Purchasing in 2019, the carbon dioxide emissions of China's logistics industry have exceeded 860 million tons, accounting for 8.8 % of the country's total emissions (Haoxiang, 2022).Green logistics technology and sustainable logistics management have become research hotspots in related fields and many related research results and practical cases have emerged (Liu, Zhang, Liu, Wang, & Wang, 2019, Zhu, 2012).For example, Menti et al.(2023) had employed the Technology Assessment and Implementation Model (TAIM) as a systematic, reproducible, and straightforward framework to effectively execute logistics 4.0.Additionally, Liu, Zhang, Liu, Wang, & Wang (2019) also developed support for the real-time state perception model of logistics vehicles for the IoT.This permits vehicles to gather up-to-the-minute data and relay it to a responsive distribution hub, oversee value-added logistics data on behalf of the hub, and formulate a dynamic optimization approach for intelligent vehicles and logistical assignments to enhance resource utilization and realize an enduring equilibrium encompassing economic, environmental, and societal aims.Jing Dong (JD), an innovation-oriented e-commerce enterprise, is evolving into a primary supplier of technology and services rooted in supply chains, therefore it was chosen for this study.It builds corporate supply chains and sustainable consumption based on a green, low-carbon business model to achieve green economic development.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"deczl8uAKrtAsx3+cT5c5qTfBBvK/UbZXeX26l2BgI8="},"ca3d6960-328b-4c73-b695-11612caedf5e":{"id_":"ca3d6960-328b-4c73-b695-11612caedf5e","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"affe7b45-fd5e-4f5b-9694-79965b11ea5a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"cMqgYyliSzZIjADCweln3xwBHT5tNBRLlmkv7e8UM74="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8b508bca-91be-4cf2-b304-182ef45ad4c4","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"deczl8uAKrtAsx3+cT5c5qTfBBvK/UbZXeX26l2BgI8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"21844bfa-d9d6-4d2d-bbe7-54bd6778f261","metadata":{},"hash":"JANpmpgumhWINirGRAEukybyXdeJRb34RJF1yrY1cYo="}},"text":"For

based on a green, low-carbon business model to achieve green economic development.In 2019, JD joined the Scientific Emissions Reduction Initiative (SBTi) and became the first logistics company to achieve its scientific emissions reduction target.It uses new energy to transport vehicles and installed distributed energy to reduce carbon emissions by 26,000 tons.JD have launched energy vehicles in more than 50 cities in seven major regions of the country, reducing at least 120,000 tons annually from 2017 to 2020.JD also have achieved environmental benefits through green procurement processes including recycling (JD.com, 2021a, JD.com, 2021b).According to the JD database, the company has used approximately more than one million safe and environmental friendly reusable shipping bags.In 2017, JD Logistics have used 100,000 recyclable green boxes to deliver their goods and has reduced the number of disposable foam boxes and the number of disposable ice packs by 180 million and 160 million, respectively.In the past two years, JD have saved 250 million meters of \"slim\" tape after the launching of the \"ultra-thin\" tape, which can reduce 400 million meters of tape every year (JD.com, n.d.; Kidron, 2021).Green logistics standard and certifications\nGreen logistics standards and certifications have attracted the attention of enterprises, governments and consumers.A rising quantity of multinational companies are pledging to exclusively collaborate with suppliers who uphold social and environmental criteria (Villena & Gioia, 2020).The ecological packaging administration within logistics firms represents an ecological safeguard protocol concerning environmentally friendly packaging components (Zhang & Zhao, 2012).Environmental pollution from logistics packaging is becoming increasingly serious, and the future development of recyclable logistics packaging (RGLP) has received extensive attention (Sun & Li, 2021).Integrating environmentally conscious technological advancements into logistics packaging is a strategy employed to mitigate pollution and for sustainable progress (Xiang et al., 2013).The utilization of recyclable environmental friendly packaging in logistics contributes to the enduring advancement of the field (Olivo et al., 2020).Executing Recyclable Green Logistics Packaging (RGLP) necessitates collaborative endeavors among governmental bodies, logistics enterprises, and consumers (Sun & Li, 2021).Green certification stands as a valuable initiative enabling businesses to showcase their sustainable products, services, and practices to both employees and consumers (Zujewski, 2023).Common certification standards for green logistics include ISO 14001, LEED certification, Green Freight Europe (GFE), and Carbon Trust standards (Correia et al., 2013; Fernando, 2022, Delubac, 2023; Kern, 2008).Additionally, businesses are able to earn sustainability certifications in order to demonstrate their commitment to environmental protection.These certifications include the Cradle-to-Cradle, Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), and Rainforest Alliance certifications (Kenlon, 2021, Pattberg, 2005, Almeida, 2015; Pinto et al., 2014).Other certifications related to green logistics include the Energy Star and Green Seal certifications (Sanderford et al., 2018, Wynne, 1994).Sun and Li (2021) described the relevant green logistics policies of China.Green logistics policies are crucial for advancing green logistics, promoting green growth, and achieving sustainable development (Zhang et al., 2022).As an illustration, in 2017, a coalition of ten departments, including the State Post Bureau, collaboratively issued the \"Guiding Opinions on Coordinating the Promotion of Green Packaging in the Express Industry.\"Subsequently, in 2018, the updated nationwide standard \"Express Packaging Products\" was introduced, with an emphasis on incorporating environmentally friendly practices.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2PkSouZkJ959pj6AKMJ/cBHIXxE+8xsnj1QsLkg8CTQ="},"21844bfa-d9d6-4d2d-bbe7-54bd6778f261":{"id_":"21844bfa-d9d6-4d2d-bbe7-54bd6778f261","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"affe7b45-fd5e-4f5b-9694-79965b11ea5a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"cMqgYyliSzZIjADCweln3xwBHT5tNBRLlmkv7e8UM74="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ca3d6960-328b-4c73-b695-11612caedf5e","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"9G1DShQqa8jL5Wq1xtqXWnqxRk5q5tYuqSP3OWC1gpk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d4de5f30-36ab-47e6-8cd7-c0f9382c59d7","metadata":{},"hash":"HuAlBKHs8gOBF14riD7+39fs3V7E26SdXbx7UUuiLT0="}},"text":",

Industry.\"Subsequently, in 2018, the updated nationwide standard \"Express Packaging Products\" was introduced, with an emphasis on incorporating environmentally friendly practices.In 2019, the \"Shanghai Yuantong Waste Management Regulations\" explicitly delineated green criteria for express packaging, propelling the reduction and recycling of such packaging.Moreover, the \"Implementation Opinions on Product Certification\" clarified green criteria for express packaging, fostering both the reduction and recycling of express packaging.This collective effort by various sectors promoted the attainment of green product certifications for express packaging (Sun & Li, 2021).These standards have provided firms with a sustainable competitive advantage (Rao & Holt, 2005).Additionally, government regulations and enforcement are considered the dominant force (Meegeren, 2001) with the most significant impact on environmental decision-making (Henriques & Sadorsky, 1996).The standards and certifications about JD logistics mainly focuses on the environment, society, and discussions among suppliers.In 2021, JD referred to the \"Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guidelines\" issued by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the GRI Guidelines issued by the Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB).JD's greenhouse gas accounting boundaries mainly refers to the World Resources Institute \"Greenhouse Gas Accounting System: Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\" developed by (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).According to the current green logistics standards and certifications of JD Group: for logistics data security and personal information protection, JD refers to ISO27001 information security management system, ISO27701 privacy information security management system, and data security capability mature model (DSMM).Level 3 certification (JD Technology), Level 3 security level protection certification is approved and issued by the Ministry of Public Security, and Level 3 “Trusted Cloud” certification is issued by the Data Center Alliance.Its purpose is to ensure the security of logistics data and consumer privacy.As for green warehousing, JD Logistics has passed the Beijing Green Exchange and China Testing Certification (CTI), ISO14064 greenhouse gas emission standards, and Energy and Environmental Design Building Rating System (LEED) certifications.As an important part of JD’s green logistics, green warehousing has enhanced the role of sustainable development for JD.com.Moreover, in accordance with the relevant domestic policies and laws (technical), JD.com have also referred to relevant indicators such as the \"Green Transportation “14th Five-Year Plan\" Development Plan\", \"Carbon Peak Action Plan Before 2030\", \"2021 China Carbon Price Survey\".Besides, for the evaluation of climate-related risks and opportunities, JD.com aims to achieve sustainable development and industry influence by reducing carbon emissions from its own operations and promoting low-carbon development in the value chain and consumer sectors, aiming to achieve \"double carbon\" for society.\".Green logistic technology\nThe significant progress of the national economy has spurred the expedited growth of the logistics sector, thus engendering a range of economic and environmental challenges.Accordingly, green logistics employs sophisticated logistical management concepts and state-of-the-art technological solutions to effectively curtail energy utilization and mitigate environmental contamination (Liu & Ma, 2022).This study comprehensively reviews prior scholary research on the advancements and impact of green logistics technology.According to Anser et al.(2020), there has been increasing attention towards fostering environmentally friendly practices in the business sector.From a multidimensional standpoint, encompassing both micro and macro perspectives, the concept of green enterprise technology has emerged as a pivotal approach to ensure the development and production of products that are environmentally sustainable.This research paper aims to introduce the Energy Enhancement Technology Acceptance Model (EA-TAM) for both micro- and macro-enterprises.The study indicates that the micro-enterprise EA-TAM is applicable in the context of green investment decisions, as it contributes to a rise in the adoption of renewable energy sources for the enhancement of logistics performance, export capabilities, technological advancements, investments, and competitiveness.The macro perspective of Environmental Attitude – Theory of Planned Behavior (EA-TAM) highlights that several green factors, namely green supplier selection, industrial green engineering, green procurement, green consumerism, green product recycling, and green innovation, have the potential to positively influence green purchasing decisions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"aS7MeKaNyOnYazYcWnYNN7YmOQ3L4jqvm2E5R7NQ0BI="},"d4de5f30-36ab-47e6-8cd7-c0f9382c59d7":{"id_":"d4de5f30-36ab-47e6-8cd7-c0f9382c59d7","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"affe7b45-fd5e-4f5b-9694-79965b11ea5a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"cMqgYyliSzZIjADCweln3xwBHT5tNBRLlmkv7e8UM74="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"21844bfa-d9d6-4d2d-bbe7-54bd6778f261","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"JANpmpgumhWINirGRAEukybyXdeJRb34RJF1yrY1cYo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2d160290-9fd9-445e-8418-668c960a337f","metadata":{},"hash":"wEikeefj53rzcowZmhgolLAyY19gZLkYlFgC9uY5mXA="}},"text":"(2020),

contribute to the development of favorable perceptions regarding the convenience of using green products.In a study conducted by Tian et al.(2023), the authors explored the practical implementation of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technology across various realms within the discipline of sustainable development engineering.Additionally, they put forth prospective trajectories for the advancement of MCDM technology, specifically in relation to green logistics and low-carbon transportation systems.Moreover, ecological logistics represents an endeavor that integrates novel logistics principles and cutting-edge technologies, encompassing a transportation system that is oriented towards ecological sustainability.This holistic approach involves various components, such as material processing and recycling, wastewater treatment, energy preservation, and environmental conservation (Sotvaldieva, 2023).In addition, according to the JD ESG report (JD.com, 2021b), JD is actively promoting intelligent industrial parks, which includes achieving zero carbon emissions through \"green infrastructure + carbon reduction technology innovation\".JD have also established the first \"Asia No.1\" smart industrial park in Xi'an Intelligent Industrial Park.The industrial park has achieved green warehousing and zero emissions (JD.com, 2021a, JD.com, 2021b).In 2021, JD Industrial Products already have 200 infrastructure facilities nationwide.In addition to that, JD have also created its first “smart mobile warehouse” and put it into use.JD Industrial Products have solved the problem of intelligent warehousing by implementing smart mobile warehouses to integrate procurement digital technology and infrastructure.Moreover, JD have established green and low-carbon goals to support China’s 2060 carbon neutrality goal (JD.com, 2021b).JD uses digitalization (IoT, Artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and blockchain) to transform and upgrade its main industries.As of the end of 2021, JD have established more than 70 data centers and nearly 100 edge data centers around the world.At the same time, JD’s IoT operating system services cover multiple industry fields, cooperate with more than 1000 companies, and have access to more than 4000 smart devices (JD.com, 2020, JD.com, 2021b).To add on, JD.com also uses smart express vehicles and drone delivery in logistics and distribution (JD.com, 2021b, JD logistics, 2016).As of 2016, JD Logistics has a fleet of 30 drones, which have solved the problem of undeliverable express delivery in remote areas.For example, due to COVID-19, the road in a village on the other side of Baiyang Lake was blocked and packages could not be delivered, but the drone was able to fly about 2 kilometers across the lake from the West Embankment Pier of Baiyang Lake and arrived at a village on the other side of the lake in just a few minutes.Hence, the drones were able to achieve the fixed-point delivery.In conjunction to this, the establishment of drones by JD Logistics have addressed the route disruptions due to COVID-19 (Cao, 2020).JD Logistics also haveput into use nearly 400 smart express vehicles, which are distributed in more than 25 cities across the country.Smart express vehicles are becoming an important supporting force for end-of-line distribution and anti-epidemic protection.In the next two to three years, JD Logistics will continue to develop and launch thousands of smart express vehicles to continue to improve service experience and logistics efficiency (JD.com, 2021b).This study has used JD as a model to study green logistics technology, standards, and certification from the perspective of logistics practitioners.This study has been comprehensively reviewed how JD achieved success in sustainable development and provides a reference and inspiration for sustainable development in the logistics industry.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"H86hfhYd3gLXM+HZVY6bTyFQJ2zvt+alJ0Q8BrccLEY="},"2d160290-9fd9-445e-8418-668c960a337f":{"id_":"2d160290-9fd9-445e-8418-668c960a337f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"affe7b45-fd5e-4f5b-9694-79965b11ea5a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"cMqgYyliSzZIjADCweln3xwBHT5tNBRLlmkv7e8UM74="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d4de5f30-36ab-47e6-8cd7-c0f9382c59d7","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"HuAlBKHs8gOBF14riD7+39fs3V7E26SdXbx7UUuiLT0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"54fc99b3-1a14-41c9-8030-c86caf3d5f92","metadata":{},"hash":"Z6H5Dr9obF9++hmyinQFgfbh0KubBYhKwUFat4sUqCA="}},"text":"Hence,

industry.Hence, this study focuses on the collection and processing of relevant data and combined relevant theories to provide valuable opinions and suggestions for logistics companies’ sustainable logistics and green logistics management.The manuscript outline is as follows: Subsequent to the introduction, the study also elaborates on the research object, data collection, research variables, and research model in Section 2.Section 3 presents the important findings of this study and establishes the data model.All the findings are discussed in detail in Section 4.Finally, Section 5 summarizes the research, as well as research limitations, prospects, and several practical implications.Methodology\nThis study has evaluated JD's green logistics technology, standards, and certifications from the perceptions of JD logistics practitioners.Innovation in logistics technology can be divided into data acquisition, information acquisition, warehousing, and transportation technology (Lin, 2007).Furthermore, given the swift evolution of the logistics sector, the standards for certifying logistics service quality assume a crucial role in overseeing the logistics market.This involvement aids in enhancing corporate competitiveness, elevating customer contentment, and minimizing potential hazards (Wang & Hu, 2016).For this investigation, a cross-sectional research approach was embraced, gathering data from JD logistics professionals in a defined interval.Surveys were employed to acquire primary data directly from individuals engaged in logistics-related roles, employing a consequential 5-point Likert scale (Wyatt and Meyers, 1987, Adelson and McCoach, 2010, Finstad, 2010).This study was obtained with permission from JD management and ensured the anonymity of the participants.The selection criteria for JD logistics practitioners were limited to those who are able to converse in Chinese language.The research ensures that all participants share a common language and cultural background for homogeneity of demographics in order to reduce the possibility of miscommunication or misunderstanding that could lead to a biased response simultaneously reducing the variability in the results.Overall, these measures helped to ensure that the data collected is more accurate and reliable.Stratified snowball sampling technology was used to obtain scientific data from logistics practitioners.Snowball sampling constitutes of a non-probability sampling strategy where an initially chosen population unit or element serves as the starting point for the selection of other units within the population.This sequential process relies on the connections between these units.As a result, snowball sampling has demonstrated its significance as a methodology for examining populations with distinctive attributes.Logistics activities encompass distinct categories such as transportation, inventory management, storage, material handling, packaging, and value-added operations (Maji et al., 2023).This research employed the snowball approach for data collection within each subset of JD logistics practitioners.The initial point of sampling functioned as a basis for selecting subsequent samples.In each logistical category, the sampling process typically began with a JD logistics practitioner who referred other counterparts engaged in similar business types.This data collection procedure persisted until it reached a sample size of 309 participants.The cessation of data collection was prompted by the thorough coverage of logistics enterprises within the designated study area.Another rationale for embracing this sampling approach stemmed from the challenge of precisely ascertaining the total population of JD logistics firms.This complexity arises primarily due to the extensive distribution of JD Logistics' numerous warehouses and the decentralized nature of logistics professionals' management.Consequently, the utilization of this sampling technique simplifies the process for researchers to amass a substantial number of samples, facilitating a rough approximation of the JD logistics enterprises' population within the designated study region.Unlike many logistics enterprises, this study focused on a single logistics enterprise.This reduced data collection costs to a certain extent.The variables considered in this study includes the green logistics technology, standards, certification, environment, and sustainability.The green logistics standards and certification variables included economic, environmental, and social aspects (Appendix A).The items were answered using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the chi-square method, and regression analysis (Akhtar et al.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+NFKJtkai1gN93ieZETgo5XBLhJh8WftrBUDvaSlDZk="},"54fc99b3-1a14-41c9-8030-c86caf3d5f92":{"id_":"54fc99b3-1a14-41c9-8030-c86caf3d5f92","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"affe7b45-fd5e-4f5b-9694-79965b11ea5a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"cMqgYyliSzZIjADCweln3xwBHT5tNBRLlmkv7e8UM74="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2d160290-9fd9-445e-8418-668c960a337f","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"wEikeefj53rzcowZmhgolLAyY19gZLkYlFgC9uY5mXA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"307cfccd-0c86-4d82-adef-c69155bc1b27","metadata":{},"hash":"GWet4n6RRwoGTd7VpOrtfaDGih04HRaw6lXDTXYFKA0="}},"text":"Another

2016; Montgomery et al., 2009).Descriptive statistics included tables, graphs, frequency distributions, and percentage distributions (Pérez-Vicente et al., 2009; Sonnad, 2002).In order to assess the hypothesis positing the integration of green logistics technologies, logistics standards, and certification endeavors within the practices of JD logistics professionals, a sum-of-squares regression approach was utilized.Subsequently, the estimated coefficients were examined at a specified significance level to establish the connection between the anticipated variables and the resulting outcomes.Results & discussion\nIn order to ensure an ample and representative sample, 309 questionnaires were disbursed among JD logistics practitioners, employing a hierarchical grouping based on their roles within JD logistics.Ultimately, 309 questionnaires were collected, subsequently coded, and subjected to thorough cleansing.The entirety of the collected questionnaires proved valid.Hence, this research relied upon 309 questionnaires from JD logistics practitioners and employed SPSS for data coding and subsequent analysis.The demographic characteristics of JD logistics practitioners were tabulated to display both the frequency and percentage distribution.These demographic factors encompassed gender, age, marital status, educational attainment, type of logistics involvement, and years of experience within the logistics field.The demographic information is summarized in Table 1.Based on the survey results, within the group of 309 JD logistics practitioners, males represented 55.7 % of the total, while females accounted for 44.3 %.Additionally, approximately 89 % of the respondents were older than 26 years old, and the remaining approximately 11 % were between the ages of 18 and 25.Similarly, approximately 5 % of logistics practitioners were divorced, 78 % of logistics practitioners were married, and the remaining logistics practitioners were single.Table 1.Jingdong

improve JD’s sustainable development (SGL5).The results show that 5 % of JD logistics practitioners strongly agree, 43 % of JD logistics practitioners agree, 32 % of JD logistics practitioners expressed a neutral attitude, and 19 % disagreed.This research examined the hypothesis involving crucial demographic factors, green logistics technologies, logistics standards, and certification criteria.Chi-square and regression analyses were employed to establish the connections between green logistics technologies and logistics categories, as well as the associations between green logistics standards, certification, and years of experience.The findings are presented in Table 2, Table 3.The card method gauges the real variance between observed and anticipated frequencies, serving as a significant tool in sampling inquiries to recognize disparities between theoretical assumptions and empirical evidence (Pandis, 2016).Regression methods were used for robustness checks.The use of these estimation methods was justified, given their use in related studies (Lu & White, 2014).The outcomes of the hypothesis testing concerning the connection between logistics categories (namely transportation, warehousing, freight forwarding, and packaging) and green logistics technologies are outlined in Table 2.The findings reveal that, with the exception of GLT1, GLT2, and GLT4, a noteworthy correlation exists between green logistics technology and logistics warehousing and packaging within the logistics classification.Consequently, this study deduces that logistics warehousing and packaging within the logistics category are influenced by green logistics technologies.This underscores the significant role that green logistics technology plays in the realms of warehousing and packaging logistics.Table 2.Demographic information of JD logistics practitioners.Categories Demographic Variables Frequencies Percentage (%)\nGender\nMale 1 172 55.7\nFemale 2 137

examined JD Logistics' green logistics technology, standards, and certifications from the perspective of JD logistics practitioners using survey methodology.The research population in this study was categorized into four distinct groups encompassing freight forwarders, packaging, transportation, and warehouses.A questionnaire survey was executed among JD logistics practitioners, employing the snowball data collection approach.This yielded a total of 309 questionnaires that were determined to be valid.These questionnaires underwent a process of cleaning, coding, and subsequent analysis involving descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and regression analyses.Around 33 % of the JD logistics professionals exhibited an understanding of the adverse repercussions stemming from logistics operations on the environment.Approximately 40 % of JD logistics practitioners were aware of the importance of sustainable logistics development.Chi-square tests were employed to ascertain the demographic factors that exert influence over the adoption of green logistics technologies, standards, and certification initiatives.The results show a significant correlation between green logistics technology, logistics warehousing, and logistics packaging in the logistics category.This indicates that green logistics technology plays an important role in warehousing and packaging logistics.Additionally, logistics practitioners' years of experience in the industry helps reduce logistics costs and provide operational efficiency.In order to verify the strength of the findings, this study carried out a robustness assessment utilizing linear regression.In this analysis, sustainability served as the dependent variable, while all indicators of green logistics technology were treated as independent variables.The outcomes revealed that the implementation of green logistics technology methodologies enhances environmental sustainability.This is underscored by the positive indications of standardized coefficients linked to green logistics technologies.Specifically, the transportation of goods on JD.com exhibited significance at the 1 % level, and logistics packaging attained significance at the 5 % level.The implications of these findings in terms of policy considerations are outlined below: Roughly 30 % of JD logistics practitioners lack awareness regarding the adverse environmental consequences associated with logistics operations within the study domain.This outcome suggests that if the practitioners within JD's logistics sphere remain uninformed about the environmental ramifications tied to their activities, it could hinder the potential for adopting sustainable practices, their efforts to ensure green logistics practices will be hindered.Hence, it is imperative for JD to elevate environmental consciousness among the concerned practitioners and promote the utilization of cleaner energy sources and environmentally friendly materials within the logistics framework.Furthermore, the fact that over 35 % of JD logistics practitioners lack an understanding of the significance of sustainable development indicates a critical need for educational initiatives and awareness campaigns to underscore the importance of sustainable practices within the logistics sector.Therefore, JD needs to improve awareness of the sustainable development of logistics practitioners to help improve its brand reputation.As the logistics category and years of experience in the logistics industry are important demographic factors that affect green logistics technology and green logistics standards and awareness, this study further showed that the most experienced JD logistics practitioners, especially logistics warehousing and logistics packaging practitioners, should be provided with on-the-job awareness training on the benefits of green logistics technologies and practices of green logistics standards and awareness.This objective can be achieved by highlighting the reciprocal connections between seasoned and less experienced logistics practitioners within the sector.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"anoPhm42RR4BugGR2jX64NgbBoE/JerAcVIZssKvxIM="},"27b45230-f079-479f-ab89-493ec2712a3a":{"id_":"27b45230-f079-479f-ab89-493ec2712a3a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"affe7b45-fd5e-4f5b-9694-79965b11ea5a","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"cMqgYyliSzZIjADCweln3xwBHT5tNBRLlmkv7e8UM74="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c4b64ddb-8857-4706-a56c-bf0a35b59822","metadata":{"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521223000512"},"hash":"744bZ1tjJUuOWRU6rny64hTsBa0DKM9McSYcrn1USYQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0184badf-6518-42f8-8b50-b788ed8b7b7f","metadata":{},"hash":"aVmY83+dx+aDY/cHu6JV0CfzUCrEp6rMDoT6ZrRZkJ8="}},"text":"Hence,

should expand beyond questionnaires, encompassing site visits to firms and conducting face-to-face interviews.This approach would further enhance the data collection process concerning green logistics undertakings.Another point of consideration is that the current study concentrates on JD Logistics practitioners, rather than targeting specific subgroups such as logistics managers and supervisors.This limitation prompts a recommendation for future investigations to explore a broader range of logistics professionals to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.The research is also limited to one company in China which restricts the generalizability of findings.Data Statement\nThe data generated by this research is available from the corresponding author on

But to participate in new markets and serve large clientele with unique shopping experiences, you must:\nKnow and apply e-Commerce trends\nHave a well-designed, functional, and eye-catching website\nTake care of the back-end processes\nHave a solid digital platform that supports the e-business and its operations management\nIncrease efficiency and reduce shipping costs\nThis article elaborates upon each of these aspects to help you strengthen your e-Commerce business and prepare you for success in 2022.\nKnow and Apply eCommerce Trends\nAt least seven out of 10 people use the internet as their primary purchasing channel, which is more than enough reason for you to know what will work for eCommerce in 2022. These are the trends you should consider:\nAccept payments in cryptocurrencies and use other blockchain technologies\nIncrease direct contact with customers through tools such as video assistance or WhatsApp\nPromote voice searches\nStreamline shipments and boost quick commerce\nDesign aggressive campaigns for the peak season\nApply marketing strategies such as “Sensory Marketing”\nTake initiatives to explain to consumers what your business is, how you work and why your products and services are the best in terms of quality.\nPromote sustainable consumerism demanded by new consumers, for whom the environment is a concern. Show responsibility and commit to as many social causes as possible.\nApply the re-commerce model—one of the most prominent trends of 2022 for resale, reverse trade, or purchase of second-hand products.\nThe Website\nThe website of a digital business must have the following elements for its success:\nGood Design\nRemember that your website is the equivalent of your physical store and must represent your identity and purpose.\nCatalog\nThe distribution and display of your products need special attention, especially for customers buying from your site for the first time. Make sure the descriptions and features are clear and detailed and keep processes, pricing, and availability up to date. This must be accompanied by good-quality images.\nShopping Cart\nAlways keep it visible and easy to identify. Make sure it is easy for your consumers to use.\nPayment Methods and Security\nOffer an intuitive, short, verified, and reliable payment route to further guarantee the closing of your sales.\nSearch Engine Optimization\nMake sure your website has a relevant ranking in search engines, which can be ensured if the content meets basic requirements such as length, use of keywords, proper site programming, and more. Always remember that internet searches are one of the primary sources of website traffic.\nAdaptability of the Website on Different Devices\nMobility is decisive for any eCommerce business. Make sure your consumers can easily purchase your products from any electronic device, including PCs, tablets, or mobile phones. Remember that visibility on all types of screens is essential. Your site must be genuinely “responsive” throughout the purchase process besides being adaptable to screen size.\nCustomization\nCustomize as much as you can as personalization is the easiest way to make a customer feel unique and essential.\nRatings and Reviews\nMake sure you know what your customers think about their shopping experiences. Only then will you know what you can improve upon.\nShare Feature\nAllowing your consumers to share products is a decisive advantage absent from many eCommerce websites designs. Enable the feature for your customers to share products with helpful and practical short links.\nCustomer Support\nEnsure the quality of communication with your consumers once they have purchased your products.\nUser Experience\nMany UX features seem insignificant because they are small. However, they are highly relevant to your results and do not take much time to design and include in your website.\nHear From Industry Experts\nRead the latest tips, research, best practices, and

name*\nTake Care of the Back-End Processes\nConsidering that 85% of Internet users who do not find a product in less than two minutes leave the site and 60% never return, you will understand that e-business is only viable if the customer perceives it as safe, reliable, and comfortable.You must optimize the back-end processes using a multi-channel sales software.Try to optimize the service as below:\nAssess the supply chain flow and identify weaknesses to reduce delivery times.Protect your customers’ personal information using data encryption or other security techniques.Control inventory accurately to deliver on sales promises.Eliminate manual processing and outdated inventory synchronization methods.By improving your back-end operations, you will make your website easier to use, increase customer loyalty, better manage your business, and indeed increase sales.Digital Platforms\nA business with eCommerce operations faces significant challenges beyond sales strategies and proper website design.In addition, security, inventory, and logistics issues must be addressed.Order management, inventory management, and the fulfillment process must be supported by intelligent and automated solutions that eliminate human errors, omissions, and manual logistics coordination limitations.Regardless of whether it is a B2B or B2C marketplace, shopping carts, or Amazon FBA or FBM, it is necessary to guarantee the same quality customer experience.This will be the deciding factor in making your eCommerce business a success or a failure.Increase Efficiency and Reduce Shipping Costs\nThe following patterns of complaints and claims from online consumers are repeated:\nDelays\nConfusions in delivery\nComplete misinformation regarding the status of orders\nGreat difficulty in making a return\nInsecurity while purchasing\nThe new reality, filled with unusual demand peaks, has revealed a significant lack of processes and technologies that guarantee the operational continuity of online businesses, which should focus on strengthening demand planning and demand fulfillment.The only viable solution is to implement a technological solution with “super-powers” that can support every aspect from shipping management to inventory management and ensure a seamless integration with your eCommerce strategy so that you can avoid the following:\neCommerce Disconnected from Demand Planning and Demand Fulfillment\nMany businesses continue to operate based on their founders’ intuition or experience about customer demand since they do not have the capital or the appropriate tool to optimize management.Purchase orders, payment to suppliers, receipt of merchandise, and manually managed storage will inevitably result in overstock, decreased cash flow, space problems due to products that are not rotating, shortages of the merchandise sold the most, and so on.A solution that connects the information of your SAP Business One with your online store will ensure the administration and monitoring of your orders flexibly and will maintain an inventory in tune to comply with the fulfillment process and the arrival of the products to the logistics centers from Amazon, Walmart, Target, Mercado Libre, etc., avoiding fines or rejections for non-compliance, all from the same single panel.Overselling\nIt is obvious that when an online business is present on several platforms, its chances of sales increase.However, under manual logistics, you must constantly update the stocks in every sales platform without fail.For instance, you figure out that you have 200 units of a product and sell 100 on Amazon.Let us suppose you do not update the availability on the rest of the platforms.In that case, you run the risk of overselling, running out of stock of the requested product, failing to fulfill your sales promises, and resulting in a dissatisfied customer who probably will not purchase your product in the future.One connector in your eCommerce operations ensures perfectly aligned products and stocks across multiple platforms, reducing the risk of overselling.Remember that keeping sales promises is essential for the business to last over time.Shipping Products Without Many Options\nThe requirements of your customers vary considerably.The ideal solution would be to offer a carrier option in which you have control of the shipment to inform your customers about the status of purchases at any point even if the order does not arrive at its destination on time; for instance, it will allow you to evaluate the quality of the services.On the other hand, it does not always cost the same to ship products to one zip code or another if you distribute them nationwide.When this process is administered manually, you must enter the portal of each carrier, and indicate product dimensions, distance, and other conditions to determine the best option.While informing your customers and controlling your shipments, you must keep a track of the carrier, the dates, the tracking number, and all the related details available.The operations become worse if you manage multiple warehouses!However, these problems are solved if you enhance the order management system with a connector for your e-Commerce operations capable of integrating with the most prestigious carriers in the market, providing multiple cost options for each shipment, generating complete traceability, and maintaining constant follow-ups of all your orders automatically.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"msRHY8DEmSFMQEtL5LhWdPxeTT9D5NOaB5G2Grp0cOI="},"79d936c7-67c3-438a-8d76-c0208e94e1d4":{"id_":"79d936c7-67c3-438a-8d76-c0208e94e1d4","metadata":{"url":"https://upcity.com/experts/ecommerce-in-2022/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e9f64990-b6af-4d2d-b7e1-cc1661cb3a7e","metadata":{"url":"https://upcity.com/experts/ecommerce-in-2022/"},"hash":"MyyPnjvB5Hmk5xwEcnEspTPYBBBYVGUv7wWw39G0QHU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9b875709-6371-4efd-b613-706fd0794b56","metadata":{"url":"https://upcity.com/experts/ecommerce-in-2022/"},"hash":"UDEUNK7R4WwPdC7RV2kbSZ0TBS3hr7iQzgBjPS2CSqA="}},"text":"On

reach its destination, arrive in poor condition, or the customer may receive something that he did not purchase.Whether your eCommerce operations are carried out manually or not, the need to manage returns, apply reverse logistics and reverse payments exists.You must attend to it with the same level of quality with which you work on a new sale.However, being aware of what happens in every operation, tracking the products you sent, reversing money, and so on, can become a complex process and a huge issue unless you have a technological solution with which you can implement this in an easy, timely, and automated manner, based on the information of the purchase orders downloaded from your SAP Business One.The Perfect Solution for an Infallible eCommerce\nIt does not matter if you are a wholesaler or a manufacturer, or if it is a B2B, B2C, or DTC.As the owner of an e-Commerce, you must guarantee control over the four aspects described above, and the only viable option is to connect your SAP Business One with your eCommerce (be it one or more than one).It is not very difficult to find a way to do it.Search for a system integration provider with a platform that powers SAP Business One so you can seamlessly connect your eCommerce-based sales with your inventory and distribution systems.You can quickly and inexpensively synchronize your eCommerce operations with your business management system and:\nManage all the accounting integrated into the logistics chain\nPlan for when and how much to issue a purchase order for procurement\nReceive, store, and dispatch products in a controlled manner\nKeep integrated products, codes, photos, customer prices, and sales orders\nGo through the entire dispatch process\nControl bank reconciliation and increase cash flow\nHave multiple stores working with a single inventory updated in real-time\nSee More Articles\nWe help B2B service providers increase visibility and showcase their brand credibility.We then
