to reduce your Amazon shipping costs\nBy Taylor Meeker\nShipping costs play a significant role in attracting and retaining eCommerce customers.By cutting your logistical expenses, you can increase your profits and differentiate your products from your competitors, which helps you stand out in a crowded market.Read on to learn some top tips to reduce your Amazon shipping costs, from leveraging Amazon’s programs and services to negotiating with carriers and passing on costs to customers.Mitigating Amazon FBA fee increases\nAmazon recently introduced fee increases for FBA storage utilization ratios and inventory aging.These aim to address the inefficient use of Amazon’s warehousing for unsellable goods, which monopolize space and eat into working capital via holding costs.The most notable changes are summarized as follows:\nSellers with a high inventory cube (which is the total available space they use expressed as a percent) relative to their recent weekly sales face a new storage utilization surcharge.Amazon has increased the surcharges applied to inventory stored for 271 to 365 days.Amazon introduced inventory surcharges for goods stored for 180 to 270 days, except for products in the apparel, shoes, bags, jewelry, and watches categories.To minimize the impact of these fee increases, it’s essential to reduce your shipping costs.Review and incorporate the following strategies to lower your logistical expenses and stay ahead of Amazon’s wide-reaching changes.To learn more about Amazon seller fees, check out MyFBAPrep’s Guide to Amazon Seller Fees.1.Sign up for Amazon’s Seller Fulfilled Prime program\nAmazon’s Seller Fulfilled Prime program enables you to fulfill orders and deliver them directly to domestic Prime customers from your own warehouse.Showcasing the Prime badge on your Amazon listings guarantees two-day delivery at no extra cost for Prime customers.This saves money on shipping costs and increases your sales by offering fast and free shipping.Additionally, Amazon provides the necessary transportation solutions to meet the high standards of Prime members.This perk is exclusive to the Prime program though, so, if you aren’t already, consider signing up.To enroll, you must meet specific requirements, such as providing accurate tracking information and storing your products in a secure facility.2.Enroll in Subscribe & Save\nAmazon offers a shipping subscription program designed for eCommerce retailers who ship a high volume of packages.Sellers can enjoy several benefits through the program, including:\nConsistent sales: Regular purchases and 20% of annual revenue\nCustomer loyalty: Repeat customers and increased consumer loyalty with minimal investment\nEngaged customers: Subscribers are more likely to purchase additional items\nIncreased visibility and reach: Priority placement and enhanced custom search filters in a dedicated storefront\nTo participate in the Subscribe & Save program, sellers must meet the following eligibility requirements:\nSeller feedback rating of 4.7 or higher\nWell-performing FBA account with strong sales\nActive FBA account for at least three months\nThe discount you receive from participating in Subscribe & Sale will depend on the number of packages you ship, so be sure to research the program and compare its rates to those of other carriers.3.Leverage Amazon’s Multi-Channel Fulfillment program\nIf you sell your products on multiple sales channels like Amazon, eBay, and your own website, Amazon’s Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) program can help you save on shipping expenses and increase efficiency.It allows you to fulfill orders from various platforms through Amazon’s fulfillment centers.Obviously, you’ll need a seller account on Amazon to participate in the program.However, you also have to meet certain criteria similar to those of Seller Fulfilled Prime, including providing accurate tracking information and ensuring your products are stored in a secure facility.4.Ship your products in bulk\nShipping products in bulk enables you to take advantage of carrier volume discounts when you ship a large volume of products simultaneously.So, consider sending your products in large batches rather than individual ones.When shipping in bulk, use sturdy packaging materials to ensure your products arrive at their destination in good condition.5.Send larger packages\nLarger packages let you leverage dimensional weight pricing, which slashes your fulfillment expenses because you pay based on the package size, not only its weight.You should use larger boxes or pack your products to maximize the package’s size.Like with bulk shipments, use sturdy packaging materials to ensure your products arrive at their destination in optimal condition.6.Capitalize on Amazon’s Buy Shipping discounts\nAmazon introduced a Sponsored Discount option that allows you to purchase shipping labels through Buy Shipping at a discounted rate.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wibQ/C31ZVJGSxwGGsxg5QPFdxBB+jAKzmpqa9bL7Mc="},"0ef57cd5-de29-4c4f-8fec-0301321015b2":{"id_":"0ef57cd5-de29-4c4f-8fec-0301321015b2","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"56098107-fc92-4873-87f3-8cb5a766622e","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"VLh/eMA6/jYHE7JiCDeHNPupTCCfLa6EKOSHuw5X9Ek="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"47683085-34b2-4413-a4b0-d7024383943a","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"wibQ/C31ZVJGSxwGGsxg5QPFdxBB+jAKzmpqa9bL7Mc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"12227890-ede9-43df-974f-68d8c77be8cf","metadata":{},"hash":"atiPeMiiFycBZ5IUX6Q3f8zB2YHEbBM7AFWsxDbdwf8="}},"text":"4.Ship

Shipping discounts\nAmazon introduced a Sponsored Discount option that allows you to purchase shipping labels through Buy Shipping at a discounted rate.You can access these cost savings by logging into your Seller Central account and navigating to the Buy Shipping page.Look for the blue “Amazon Sponsored Discount” badge to find the shipping methods with discounted prices (they’re listed next to the badge).The number of labels you purchase determines how large a discount you receive, so research the program as well as the rates of other carriers.7.Take advantage of Amazon’s free shipping options\nResearch has shown time and time again that shipping costs are one of the biggest barriers to completing a purchase online.Approximately 28% of online shoppers will abandon their purchase if they encounter unexpected shipping costs during checkout.Offering fast and free shipping can have a significant impact on your business:\nIncrease conversions and reduce cart abandonment\nBoost customer satisfaction and loyalty\nRaise the average order value\nIf you don’t offer free shipping, there’s a good chance that customers will go to a competitor who does.One of the easiest ways to offer free shipping to your customers is through Amazon FBA.With Amazon’s fulfillment program, you can offer fast and free shipping without having to worry about the logistics of shipping yourself.8.Partner with regional carriers\nOpting for regional carriers like FedEx and UPS is a cost-effective solution for your shipping needs, as they often provide lower rates than their competitors.Be sure to compare the rates of regional carriers with those of larger ones to find the best deals.Further, regional carriers may have varying delivery times and coverage areas, so it’s crucial to evaluate your options carefully and select the one that meets your requirements.9.Negotiate with carriers for better rates\nRelated to the previous strategy, you can often secure lower shipping rates by negotiating with carriers based on the volume of packages you ship, the size of your packages, and other factors.For the most fruitful negotiations, contact carriers directly and discuss your shipping needs and goals.Or, you may consider using a third-party service to negotiate rates on your behalf.10.Adopt flat-rate shipping\nFlat rate shipping allows you to charge a fixed shipping fee, regardless of the weight or size of the package.Flat-rate boxes and envelopes take advantage of dimensional weight pricing to reduce your shipping costs.This can be an effective measure to attract customers and increase sales, as many buyers are willing to pay a flat rate for shipping in exchange for the convenience and reliability it provides.11.Utilize USPS Priority Mail\nUSPS Priority Mail is a cost-efficient solution for shipping packages with fast delivery times and competitive pricing.Before embracing this service, however, be sure to research the delivery times, shipping restrictions, and other key factors to ensure it’ll accommodate your needs.12.Assemble packages with Amazon’s supplied shipping materials\nAmazon offers a variety of shipping supplies at a discounted rate, including boxes, envelopes, and packing materials.This can save on dunnage expenses, but be sure to look into the restrictions and guidelines for each carrier to ensure your packages are eligible for the discounted rate.13.Pass on some of your shipping costs to customers\nHaving customers shoulder some of your shipping costs will reduce your logistical expenses and increase profitability.You could consider charging a small shipping fee either as a flat rate or based on the weight of the package.When shipping costs are passed to customers, clearly communicate the prices and allow buyers to choose their shipping method.Alternatively, you can offer free shipping for orders over a certain amount, which encourages customers to spend more.14.Contract third-party fulfillment services\nThird-party fulfillment services like Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) can slash your shipping costs and boost efficiency.These providers handle the storage and shipping of your products, freeing up time and resources for your business.When considering a third-party fulfillment service, research their fees, restrictions, and delivery times to locate the best one for your business.Looking for ways to cut your FBA fees?Learn more in MyFBAPrep’s guide to understanding and reducing your Amazon FBA fees.15.Choose the most economical shipping service\nTo find a cost-effective shipping service for your business, look into different shipping methods and compare their rates and benefits.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"n/gRlUxLpcM3H+Y/awbgI0iV1/Pe9E+2ZmtbEbAbG5k="},"12227890-ede9-43df-974f-68d8c77be8cf":{"id_":"12227890-ede9-43df-974f-68d8c77be8cf","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"56098107-fc92-4873-87f3-8cb5a766622e","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"VLh/eMA6/jYHE7JiCDeHNPupTCCfLa6EKOSHuw5X9Ek="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0ef57cd5-de29-4c4f-8fec-0301321015b2","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"SY5qBGXlULKSAh2/Mg5Qvx4xKpVr2AivNdNbBZbpHjc="}},"text":"When

on your shipping expenses and help you identify opportunities to lower costs.To use this tool, log in to your Seller Central account and access Shipping Reports.There, you’ll find valuable information such as the cost per shipment, the cost per unit, and your total shipping costs.17.Make use of Amazon’s shipping credits\nAmazon offers shipping credits to eligible sellers who meet specific criteria, such as providing accurate tracking information.Applying these credits can lower your shipping expenses and boost your profitability.It’s essential to monitor the requirements for these shipping credits regularly to ensure you remain eligible and can take advantage of the cost savings.How MyFBAPrep lowers Amazon shipping rates for sellers\nMyFBAPrep can help sellers reduce Amazon shipping

and How to Reduce Shipping Costs\nAmazon Inbound Placement Fees: What They Are and How to Reduce Shipping Costs\nBy Tom Wicky\nOn March 1, 2024, Amazon rolled out their new inbound placement fees for FBA inventory.This fee is to cover the cost of splitting and sending inbound inventory to multiple locations in order to ensure fast delivery across all consumer bases.The new fee works out to: a $0.21–$0.68 per item fee for standard items and $2.16–$6 fee for large bulky and extra-large (formerly oversized) items sent to a single location and $0-$3.32 per large bulky unit sent to two to four locations.This new fee has many sellers (and even the Federal Trade Commission) rightfully enraged.The cost of the service that Amazon had previously provided for free to boost their Prime fast shipping promise is now shifted to sellers, many of whom already have thin margins.As a workaround to avoid placement fees, sellers used tools that create numerous inbound shipping plans automatically via the Amazon API, compared costs and fees, and then choose the options with the lowest costs.As of April 15 however, that will no longer be an option, as Amazon started charging an additional “abandoned shipment” fee.That’s left many FBA sellers scrambling to manage new fees and continue to keep costs low.In this article, we will cover the basics of the new fees, seller response, how to minimize your inbound placement fees, and how MyFBAPrep can help thanks to strategic Amazon partnerships.What’s new in Amazon fees\nIn a nutshell, Amazon’s inventory placement fees for 2024 are:\nNew inventory placement fee: Standard–sized products have an average placement fee of $0.27 per unit, while for the large bulky category, the fee averages out to $1.58 per unit.However, costs vary depending on the specific item and on whether you split inbound shipments across multiple Amazon regions.Reduced FBA fees on most items: Amazon offers reduced FBA fees on most items for an average discount of $0.20.However, that estimate doesn’t account for new placement fees.Fees for low inventory: Products that have an average of less than 28 days of inventory in stock will receive a fee.These vary depending on the product, but we’ve seen quotes as high as $0.89 per unit.To encourage inventory increases, Amazon decreased non-peak storage costs by about $0.09 per cubic foot as of April 1.Fees for abandoned shipping plans: As of April 15, 2024, sellers will be charged a fee for abandoned shipping plans.Abandoned shipping plans means any shipping plan which is approved by the seller and then not used.This is likely Amazon’s response to vendors using third-party software to generate shipping plans and approving them to see how Amazon automatically splits them, until they find an option with no fees.Amazon’s new inbound placement fees for 2024\nAmazon launched their new inbound placement fee on March 1, 2024.Unlike old placement fees, which only applied to oversized (now large bulky) products, the new ones also encompass small and lightweight as well as standard-sized items.Standard items now have an average placement fee of $0.27 per unit, while large bulky products see a median of $1.58 across all shipment split configurations.However, for large-bulky products shipped to a single Amazon region, that’s a median of $4.08 per inbound unit.However, actual fees depend on the placement service:\nMinimal shipment splits: Send to one location, pay maximum fees/no fee discount\nPartial shipment splits: Send to two locations, pay fees with a discount \nAmazon-optimized shipment splits: No fee/100% fee discount\nSource\nThese discounts will also pertain to large bulky items, although the base fees are different.For example, fees start at $2.16–$2.67 for large bulky items (max 59” x 33” x 33”) weighing five pounds or less and reach up to $6 per item if the item is 42–50 pounds.However, you can also receive the up-to-100% discount by shipping your product to four or more locations.Seller responses to new inbound placement fees\nSellers have had mixed opinions on the recent inbound placement fees.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"LKGRM6/eqpWHt9nlS0xFB7f/aAhv1CRp2v6sZpyjgck="},"18b8d91d-05e0-497f-a2c7-2b5a56d03d08":{"id_":"18b8d91d-05e0-497f-a2c7-2b5a56d03d08","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/amazon-inbound-placement-fees-what-they-are-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9860cf8c-776b-455a-8f8b-6f363f91d788","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/amazon-inbound-placement-fees-what-they-are-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"2e6WOgIwzL7oJIweAsTmJNgmxJ7DRPhGcvcmbXw7pqs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4d064d8b-4e6d-4e10-8455-130705c9d466","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/amazon-inbound-placement-fees-what-they-are-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"LKGRM6/eqpWHt9nlS0xFB7f/aAhv1CRp2v6sZpyjgck="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b0379432-1862-498e-88b7-e85fc9f6a749","metadata":{},"hash":"FcJD+LFHvmGN62W1GS5NIHMl/U1lGJPufqlj+gh5YDo="}},"text":"However,

shipping your product to four or more locations.Seller responses to new inbound placement fees\nSellers have had mixed opinions on the recent inbound placement fees.For most, it’s an unwelcome set of new expenses that require juggling inventory and shipment.That’s especially hard on vendors who normally import directly from China and ship to a warehouse.Splitting up those shipments immediately means either making smaller orders and paying for separate costs or implementing a separate FBA prep solution in between, both of which increase expenses.Some sellers also report astronomically high fees, such as $300 placement fees compared to $122 delivery fees.Another seller on the same forum, meanwhile, quoted an increase of $12 in shipping fees and a $360 placement fee, which they were able to offset by splitting the shipment into four boxes, but it still increased their shipping costs to $30.Like we previously mentioned, many sellers initially used the API to generate shipping plans systematically until they found an option with no fees.As of April 15 though, that’s no longer an option since you’ll pay a fee for deleted and abandoned shipments.Source\nThose fees can be high in their own right:\nProduct size tier Weight Deleted and abandoned shipments\nSmall standard\nMax 15 x 12 x 0.75 inches 16 oz or less $0.02\nLarge standard\nMax 18 x 14 x 8 inches 12 or less oz $0.02\n12+ oz to 1.5 lb.$0.02\n1.5+ lb.to 3 lb.$0.03\n3+ lb.to 20 lb.$0.04\nSource\nIn short, you shouldn’t try to game Amazon by programmatically adjusting your shipments until you cut expenses.However, you need to understand the new fees so you can reduce them as much as possible in your initial shipping plan.How to minimize your inbound placement fees\nMinimizing fees under the new inventory placement fees for 2024 means you’ll have to  ship more inventory in at once to reduce fees and maintain 30-60 days of inventory.You’ll also want to take advantage of the Ships in Product Packaging (SIPP) program when possible, as you’ll receive a discount of $0.04–$1.32, depending on the product size and weight.It’s important to cut your inbound shipping fees to maintain profitability.In fact, while many sellers are feeling the pinch of added expenses, others are already optimizing shipping plans to reduce costs.You would ideally select “Amazon Optimized Shipment Splits” for every order so it can ship to four or more locations.Unfortunately, Amazon handles this distribution automatically, provided your “Amazon Optimized” is selected by going to Settings -> Fulfillment by Amazon -> Inbound Settings -> Inbound Placement.Amazon considers the size of products, geographical demand, distribution of items in boxes, and number of boxes in the shipment.That means you can increase your chances of qualifying for no placement fee by: \nHaving four to five boxes with every inbound shipment, although sometimes you’ll need more (e.g., if Amazon sends two-thirds of your shipment to a single location, you’d have to account for that and increase the number of boxes accordingly so you still secure four locations) \nCreating separate shipments for standard-sized items, non-standard items, and special handling categories \nEnsure item mix and quantities are split evenly across boxes\nWhat MyFBAPrep can do\nMyFBAPrep has Amazon partnerships that can help us reduce costs.We spoke with multiple sources in and out of Amazon to get the best recommendations on how we can help our sellers reduce their overall costs.MyFBAPrep can batch your inventory with other sellers that need to go to the same region or FBA warehouse to streamline operations.Shipping full truckloads with multiple customer goods can save on inbound fees as it’ll help you affordably take advantage of shipping to multiple areas.FBA locations are split into various regions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nAqWTbOHnZZ9yo5y6bH5xO5gKnSSELwp2Xr81va1G7M="},"b0379432-1862-498e-88b7-e85fc9f6a749":{"id_":"b0379432-1862-498e-88b7-e85fc9f6a749","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/amazon-inbound-placement-fees-what-they-are-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9860cf8c-776b-455a-8f8b-6f363f91d788","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/amazon-inbound-placement-fees-what-they-are-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"2e6WOgIwzL7oJIweAsTmJNgmxJ7DRPhGcvcmbXw7pqs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"18b8d91d-05e0-497f-a2c7-2b5a56d03d08","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/amazon-inbound-placement-fees-what-they-are-and-how-to-reduce-shipping-costs/"},"hash":"CF4CISKAusm8ATxTK/zAxQ/UBjA98UaGcxpG/NzRVdo="}},"text":"g.,

are:\nNorthwest\nSouthwest\nTexas\nMidsouth\nFlorida\nMidatlantic\nNortheast\nMidwest\nGreat Lakes\nAmong these regions, there are cross-regional pairings.So that means we can send a full truckload shipment that covers multiple regions, further saving on costs.For example, if your Amazon inventory plan asks you to send to two different regions in the Northeast, Southeast, and Central East groupings, we can send one full truckload to those regional pairs instead of two separate trucks.Again, these are constantly changing, but here’s an example of what regional pairings might look like:\nMidwest regions\nSouthwest and West-East regions\nNortheast, Southeast, and Central-East regions\nLarger Northeast regions\nEssentially, the goal is to maximize full truckloads.If they fall into region pairs, instead of doing splits we can also strategically filter shipment creations to two or three splits, then regionalize it.So doing a few splits in the Eastern region means they can all go out on one truck with our Amazon partnership resources.Wrapping up — Strategize now to weather the waves of Amazon fees\nAmazon’s inbound placement fees are hitting many sellers hard.Worse, Amazon is eliminating the go-to workaround of creating and abandoning multiple shipment plans to find optimal routes.Even if you’re able to avoid placement fees by using Amazon’s optimized shipments, you will face higher shipping expenses as a result.Careful inventory management and planning  while shipping to four or more locations can keep costs and these new fees to a minimum.Plan wisely and seek help when necessary to keep your head above water and your business in the black.You may be interested in\nFirst-class prep, logistics, and fulfillment services for eCommerce

account\nHow and Why to Outsource Your Amazon seller account\nBy Guest\nThis is a guest post from Minhas M, an SPCTEK Amazon consultant with several years of experience in the eCommerce industry.Minhas has helped numerous businesses achieve success on the Amazon marketplace.With a passion for technology and a deep understanding of the platform’s complex algorithms, he has built a reputation as a go-to expert for businesses looking to increase their sales and visibility on Amazon.Running a successful Amazon seller account requires dedication, expertise, and careful management.However, as your business grows, overseeing all aspects of your account can become overwhelming.At that point, it may be worth your time and money to hire a professional agency.In this article, I’ll explain why outsourcing the management of your Amazon seller account is a smart move, which tasks to pass off, and what to look for when choosing a service provider.Why outsource your Amazon seller account?To run an Amazon seller account effectively, you have to devote significant effort, especially as your store expands.By outsourcing the process though, you enjoy several benefits, including:\nSaved time: Outsourcing tasks such as product listing, inventory management, order fulfillment, and customer service frees up time to focus on core business activities.You can concentrate on product development, sourcing, and expanding your brand while a third party handles the day-to-day operations.Scalability: A professional service will ensure your account management scales alongside your business.These providers have the necessary infrastructure, technology, and resources to handle a large volume of products, orders, and customer inquiries, providing a seamless experience for your buyers.Enhanced product listing optimization: Optimizing product listings for maximum visibility and conversions is critical to secure sales on Amazon.Hiring experts for this task will ensure your listings are well crafted, keyword-rich, and appealing to shoppers.More efficient order fulfillment: Efficient order fulfillment is essential to meet customer expectations.Outsourcing the process to fulfillment centers or logistics providers can streamline operations, reduce shipping costs, and ensure timely delivery to maintain customer satisfaction and a positive business reputation.Professional customer service: Exceptional customer service contributes greatly to a positive reputation on Amazon.When you let professionals take over, you can feel confident that all customer inquiries are addressed promptly and respectfully.These providers are trained in Amazon-specific queries, which enables them to resolve issues quickly and maintain high customer satisfaction.Robust reporting and analytics: Professional service providers often have robust reporting and analytics tools to monitor and analyze your Amazon account’s performance.They yield valuable data on sales, consumer behavior, advertising effectiveness, and inventory management.Leveraging these analytics can help you make data-driven decisions and optimize your strategies for improved results.Amazon account management elements to outsource\nWhile every business has unique needs, there are some common aspects of Amazon account management that you should consider outsourcing.Product listing optimization\nIf your Amazon product listings struggle to generate sales, it’s time to refine and hone them.Hiring a service to optimize your product listings ensures they’re keyword-rich, well structured, and appealing to potential customers.Expert service providers can conduct thorough keyword research, write compelling product descriptions, and strengthen titles, bullet points, and back-end search terms, resulting in improved search rankings and increased sales.Inventory management\nEfficiently managed inventory is vital to avoid stockouts and maintain a positive customer experience.Outsourcing inventory management allows you to optimize stock levels, track inventory performance, and implement effective replenishment strategies.Service providers can set up inventory management systems, forecast demand, and ensure seamless integration with your supply chain to reduce the risk of inventory-related issues.Order fulfillment\nOutsourcing order fulfillment to specialized fulfillment centers or third-party logistics providers ensures fast, accurate, and cost-effective order processing and shipping.These services have the infrastructure and expertise to handle picking, packing, shipping, and tracking so you’re assured every order reaches its destination on time and in pristine condition.Customer service\nProfessional customer service companies provide prompt and efficient handling of customer inquiries, order issues, and returns.Those with expertise in Amazon-related customer support can handle a high volume of inquiries, offer multi-channel assistance, and ensure timely resolution to problems.Advertising campaigns\nRunning successful advertising campaigns on Amazon requires expertise in campaign setup, optimization, and analysis.Outsourcing your advertising efforts to experienced professionals can help you maximize your return on investment (ROI).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"K44jq2YmVSmZ2YEjnKQg4BGvkjiNbHc/9IRCZx9U5OU="},"444ce057-1c67-43f9-9982-7ca3743ccf76":{"id_":"444ce057-1c67-43f9-9982-7ca3743ccf76","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/outsource-your-amazon-seller-account/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9c8371e0-880c-46e7-ad04-46e120968d4f","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/outsource-your-amazon-seller-account/"},"hash":"o9OH/0trx8/tjkCeDZrnC3UsV6sFZZQSDWic+OPFE7c="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b33dea26-6aa3-4ba6-b548-503e80a34d4f","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/amazon/outsource-your-amazon-seller-account/"},"hash":"K44jq2YmVSmZ2YEjnKQg4BGvkjiNbHc/9IRCZx9U5OU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f038e492-8c6f-4d29-b884-607000a3571f","metadata":{},"hash":"gNvKWr4LyThtKJX2/8v7QAYvK6sXg8oWaWmp/s3Fy6I="}},"text":"Service

analysis.Outsourcing your advertising efforts to experienced professionals can help you maximize your return on investment (ROI).They can develop and manage targeted campaigns, optimize keyword bidding, and monitor performance to ensure your ad spend generates the desired results, ultimately boosting visibility and sales.Review management\nBuilding a positive review profile is crucial for establishing trust and credibility with potential customers.By handing off review management to service providers, you can monitor and respond to reviews with prompt and professional customer engagement.These third-party services can help you implement strategies to increase positive reviews, address negative feedback, and maintain a favorable reputation on the platform.Account health and performance monitoring\nMonitoring your account’s health and performance metrics is essential for uncovering areas in need of improvement and mitigating risks.Outsourced professionals will regularly review your account, identify issues, such as policy violations or performance discrepancies, and provide actionable insights to optimize performance.This proactive approach helps you maintain a healthy account and minimizes the possibility of suspension or penalties.Competitor research and analysis\nTo stay competitive on Amazon, it’s crucial to understand your competitors’ strategies and market dynamics.Specialized agencies can provide valuable insights into pricing trends, product assortment, marketing tactics, and customer preferences.These insights enable you to fine-tune your strategies and differentiate your offerings to gain a competitive edge.International expansion\nExpanding your business to international Amazon marketplaces can be a complex endeavor.However, partnering with experts who are familiar with different regions’ regulations, cultural nuances, and customer preferences can streamline the process.These professionals can assist with product translation, localization, market research, and compliance.What to look for in a service provider\nWhen selecting a professional agency to outsource your Amazon seller account, consider the following factors:\nExperience and track record: Look for providers with a proven history of working with Amazon sellers and delivering tangible results.Assess their client portfolio, read testimonials, and check case studies to gauge their expertise and success in managing Amazon accounts.An experienced provider will have a deep understanding of the platform’s intricacies and be equipped to handle various challenges that may arise.Range of services: Verify that the service offerings align with your specific needs.Choose a provider that offers a comprehensive suite of services to cover all aspects of account management.This ensures seamless integration and consistent performance across your Amazon business.Communication and transparency: Your chosen provider must maintain clear and open lines of communication.They should provide regular updates on the progress and performance of your account, be responsive to your inquiries and concerns, and designate a point of contact for you.Transparent reporting is also essential to track key metrics, assess the effectiveness of strategies, and make informed decisions.Expertise in your niche or category: Different product categories have unique challenges and require specialized knowledge.Potential partners should have a demonstrated understanding of the nuances of selling within your category and be able to provide valuable insights and recommendations.Familiarity with your niche’s market dynamics, customer preferences, and competition allows them to tailor strategies and optimize performance.Pricing structure and ROI: Evaluate the value a service provides compared to the cost.While price is an important factor, focus on the provider’s ability to deliver a positive ROI for your business.Assess their pricing models (i.e., a flat fee, percentage of sales, a combination) and consider the level of expertise, range of services, and expected outcomes when determining their overall value proposition.Look for providers who demonstrate measurable results.Conclusion\nHiring a professional agency to run your Amazon seller account offers numerous advantages, including access to platform expertise, time savings, scalability, and enhanced efficiency.Careful consideration of which aspects to outsource, coupled with a meticulous selection process for a service provider, will help you unlock the full potential of your Amazon seller account and drive sustainable growth for your business.You may be interested in\nFirst-class prep, logistics, and fulfillment services for eCommerce

Logistics Network With MyFBAPrep\nBy Rachel Andrea Go\nKaspien partners with popular eCommerce brands on multiple channels to provide real-time analytics, a comprehensive supply chain, brand protection and optimization, algorithmic advertising, multi-marketplace tools, and more.They have the unique experience and tech stack to help sellers grow and expand across marketplaces successfully and profitably.Kaspien has partnered with more than four thousand brands, achieved more than $1 billion in retail sales, and won their clients a 30% increase in sales with strategic marketing.They also build tools based on the needs they observe in the industry, such as an ad management system.Most recently, they launched seller reimbursement software that quickly identifies cases eligible for reimbursement in Amazon accounts.Their suite of services, history of excellence, and wealth of experience with multiple brands makes them a powerful ally for any eCommerce seller.Kaspien uses MyFBAPrep within their expansive logistics network to handle prep and fulfillment, while staying flexible using our eCommerce services.“MyFBAPrep primarily jumped out because there weren’t very many other providers that had the options; the different locations, the ability to support different lines of business, whether it was FBA prep, DTC pivots, or otherwise.”– Jeff Bernatz, Kaspien Strategic Warehouse Director\nWe spoke with Kaspien Strategic Warehouse Director Jeff Bernatz to learn how he stays agile and ensures seamless operations for thousands of brands.Why is a nationwide network crucial for eCommerce sellers?“We started working with MyFBAPrep in 2019….Having our inventory in multiple warehouses and being able to ship new inventory into and out of multiple warehouses gave us flexibility that we did not have before.”– Jeff Bernatz, Kaspien Strategic Warehouse Director\neCommerce success is inextricably linked to a nationwide warehouse and prep network for two reasons:\n1) Fast, affordable delivery to your final destination\nThe closer to your final destination you can prep inventory, the faster and cheaper it will be to deliver.For many sellers, the final destination is an FBA warehouse.That’s the last time they have to think about their fulfillment, as Amazon takes over the process from there.Whether your item’s goal is to get into the FBA network or to your end consumer, it’s vital to keep inventory in close proximity.2) Fast, affordable delivery from your suppliers\nThe more nodes you have in a warehouse network, the easier it is to snag a location close to your supplier.For example, if you have a supplier in California, but a warehouse in New York, you’ll spend a lot shipping goods from California to New York to be prepped, only to have them shipped back across the country for delivery.Speed and price can make or break an eCommerce business, as it has a waterfall effect on other critical aspects, including ROI, retention and CLV, buyer experience, revenue and profit, and more.Expanding from in-house to a nationwide warehouse network\n“We wanted to expand our FBA prep capabilities to different regions of the country in order to improve efficiency and reduce shipping costs.”– Jeff Bernatz, Kaspien Strategic Warehouse Director\nBefore MyFBAPrep, Kaspien used two in-house facilities and a handful of 3PLs to handle the bulk of their operations.However, they needed a more efficient solution to cover other regions of the country and reduce their shipping costs.Enter MyFBAPrep.Maintaining in-house control with outsourced nodes\n“We vetted many (10+) other 3PL providers before finding MyFBAPrep.”– Jeff Bernatz, Kaspien Strategic Warehouse Director\nKaspien knew they needed extensive coverage to stay competitive in terms of both price and service.But that didn’t mean they had to abandon their in-house facilities once they found the perfect fit.The Kaspien team tested more than 10 alternative warehouses and 3PL/4PL options, including a facility in New York they ended up closing after finding MyFBAPrep.They strategically kept their in-house warehouses to handle key processes that required tighter control, while outsourcing prep work and shipping to MyFBAPrep.As a result, they gained access to multiple locations for their inventory needs, on demand, and all part of one network.Unlocking versatility with MyFBAPrep\n“The biggest appealing factor of MyFBAPrep is there’s a lot of flexibility.If something changes in the market, we can work together with the team and address it.”","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"J8fug5DBNi4bkPt/UKprxOhyYWo4cHCvElKGt9wLEgM="},"460e3c21-fc2b-4f54-a882-084cb138bd67":{"id_":"460e3c21-fc2b-4f54-a882-084cb138bd67","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/case-studies/kaspien-case-study/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"19e032b9-7ebe-481f-a825-27b6c785b3c5","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/case-studies/kaspien-case-study/"},"hash":"hI7ouVK+iB8rT6CqscVFkn/wLniLRW7NXQPZs1bH1B4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f5d93d23-fba9-4dd9-95e7-6ca186a09df0","metadata":{"url":"https://myfbaprep.com/blog/case-studies/kaspien-case-study/"},"hash":"J8fug5DBNi4bkPt/UKprxOhyYWo4cHCvElKGt9wLEgM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a72a87f6-5ad2-4129-8afb-66875a65a539","metadata":{},"hash":"aNbvXjippaYzbh7Xmz8twImBDHx7LMYdrMkvlUZSc6A="}},"text":"–

of flexibility.If something changes in the market, we can work together with the team and address it.”– Jeff Bernatz, Kaspien Strategic Warehouse Director\nMyFBAPrep has a wide variety of eCommerce services, and we’re always willing to work with our sellers to meet their specific needs.Our expansive warehouse network gives us access to almost every eCommerce service you can imagine, from cold storage to bubble wrap machines.This enabled MyFBAPrep to equip Kaspien with the right options to address changes in the eCommerce industry, and react quickly to shifts in the marketplace.Now, Kaspien can easily pivot to new business models or alter their logistics structure on demand.They can utilize all of our services and warehouse locations, or ignore 99% of them, depending on their needs and business circumstances.For example, if they have a large shipment of goods coming in that fills an entire warehouse (it’s happened) we can route the overflow to the next closest location.If one of their brand manufacturers can no longer accommodate prep or packaging at the warehouse, they can have MyFBAPrep take on the work instead.Or, if they want to launch a larger DTC presence with one of their Amazon-only brands, MyFBAPrep can continue prepping their inventory, then split the amount we send to FBA to reserve items for DTC sales.A problem-solving operations partner\n“I love the team that we work with — I love their flexibility and the way we take on problems.If something happens or Amazon makes a change, it’s never the blame game of who is responsible for it.It’s just ‘lets attack the problem, let’s figure out how we’re going to handle it moving forward, and what’s a better way to go about this long term.”– Jeff Bernatz, Kaspien Strategic Warehouse Director\nWe work with our sellers, warehouses, and FBA to ensure items reach the FBA network seamlessly and are delivered to DTC customers quickly.But in eCommerce, things inevitably go wrong; items are lost, your marketplace imposes inventory limits, customers complain.No matter what happens, though, the MyFBAPrep team is always ready to problem solve.If anything comes up, the Kaspien team knows they can rely on MyFBAPrep and our extensive network of warehouses and services to accommodate — helping to ensure uninterrupted sales.Kaspien’s favorite part about working with MyFBAPrep\n“I love the entrepreneurial spirit of the MyFBAPrep team members we work with.They are always up to solve a problem and be flexible to help support our business needs, no matter how ‘outside the box’ our ideas may be.”– Jeff Bernatz, Kaspien Strategic Warehouse Director\nOur customers are at the center of everything we do at MyFBAPrep, and we fully invest in each of them.Every seller on our roster has a direct line to our founders and leadership team to ask questions, solve business problems, or just chat about eCommerce in general.If there’s anything we can do to help our sellers improve their business or make their lives easier, we’re always happy to lend a hand.Jeff Bernatz says it best: “Their focus is always on partnership.It’s always on how we do better together.It’s never negative, which I really appreciate, because we didn’t always have that experience with prior 3PLs.”If you’d like to expand your logistics and flexibility with MyFBAPrep, create an account or book a demo with
