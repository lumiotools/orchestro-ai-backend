We'll go through patterns for\nembedding the shipping selector, handle updates to cart or customer information and\nmarking the checkout session as completed in SIW API.\nUsing correct endpoints for integration\nMake sure that you are using correct API endpoint when using different environments for testing and production releases.\n\nNote\nPlease note that we reserve the right to introduce additional fields to our API responses without prior notification. Users are encouraged to regularly check for updates in our documentation for any changes that may impact their integration.\n\nCreating a session\nThe first thing you need to do before you can embed the shipping selector in your\ncheckout page is to create a session. This is done by calling session.create which returns session details and an HTML snippet.\nEach Session has an ID that can be used to later fetch, update or\ncomplete the session. It is recommended that you store the\nsession id together with the customer's order.\nEmbed the Delivery Checkout\nThe responses of session.create and session.get contain the attribute\ncalled html_snippet which includes the html snippet to display the shipping\nselector in your checkout page. Just put it in the part of the page where you\nwant the Delivery Checkout to be displayed.\nThe snippet will then download and execute our bootstrap.js script which spawns the iframes and sets up channels of communication for session management.\nLive React examples\nAll code examples come from our live React code sandbox. You can copy the snippets straight from there 📋","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4979,"endCharIdx":8250,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CCi5s/dwO++hI/Ctr+ZFVflLyyrjFOTgnncwcCK2Q3U="},"95d4e00b-33a9-4d29-8561-3a305652ec11":{"id_":"95d4e00b-33a9-4d29-8561-3a305652ec11","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/integration"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e5e92710-13b6-4d27-bd2b-fedfc5c5ed8f","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/integration"},"hash":"Ka2D86VaWK51X8cGc/JMc5R2iYRZE+GGluMz7gEfxnw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b9521bf7-27f9-4a6b-8e52-00e94f7796ae","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/integration"},"hash":"++QeesbHkqywyNb8Kly3XTUmj0QELvdPuya7hkCdxD8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"63cb5f79-4fae-4fac-b9a4-d743bd9cdafd","metadata":{},"hash":"3aKB8dNqkYTZ82lSs3XYb77H+ZzeJzJGPYXU/SXs27A="}},"text":"const handleCreateSession = async () => {  try {    // Call your backend and they call siw/session.create    const sessionResponse = await createSession();    // Embed the widget on the page    widgetWrapperRef.current.innerHTML = HTMLSnippet;    // Trick the browser to run the script, explained below    replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));  } catch {    // We don't believe it's possible but if our service fails, you render the fallback for the widget here  }};\n\nCopy\nWarning\nIf you're dynamically inserting the HTML snippet in the DOM, most browsers won't execute the script embedded in it. If you're lucky enough to have jQuery on your page, you can use its append() function or feel free to copy the snippet below. It removes and inserts back the script nodes to trick the browser to execute them\n\nfunction replaceScriptNode(node) {  if (isScriptNode(node) && !isExternalScript(node)) {    node.parentNode.replaceChild(cloneScriptNode(node), node);  } else {    var i = 0,      children = node.childNodes;    while (i < children.length) {      replaceScriptNode(children[i++]);    }  }  return node;}function isScriptNode(node) {  return node.tagName === \"SCRIPT\";}function isExternalScript(node) {  return !!node.src && node.src !== \"\";}function cloneScriptNode(node) {  var script = document.createElement(\"script\");  script.text = node.innerHTML;  for (var i = node.attributes.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {    script.setAttribute(node.attributes[i].name, node.attributes[i].value);  }  return script;}replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));\n\nCopy\n\nCaveats\nThe HTML snippet is designed to only be added to the page once.\nSo if you are using AJAX to load the snippet you should make sure\nthat this only happens once. Adding or replacing it multiple times\nwill cause errors.\nHowever, there is an exception to that when using Multiple widgets.\nIt allows you to add many checkout widgets to the page, but each has different id and in that case,\nthe above constraint applies to each unique widget.\n\nWarning\nhtml_snippet contains an element with unique id shipwallet-container. Make sure there’s no other element on the page with the same ID, otherwise the widget won't load.\nYou can override the default unique id with your own by requesting a merchant configuration change from our Customer Support.\n\nUpdating the cart and session\nCheckout pages often allow the user to alter the contents of the cart, locale, customer information or anything else that the session is based on. Change in any of those may adjust the available shipping options or the visual apperance of the widget\nIn such case, you will need to update the session to inform Ingrid about the changes.\nHowever, you will also have to suspend the widget, making it non-interactive for the time of the request, and resume it after you get a response from our API.\nThis allows the widget to synchronise it's state with the backend service.\nWarning\nSuspending and resuming the widget too often will cause a poor experience for the user.\nIt is completely unnecessary when reacting to user events.\nYou only want to do this if you made an api call towards update session as a result of a user interaction on your website affecting the session arguments\n\nTwo methods are exposed on the window._sw object.\n\nsuspend - Puts the widget in a freezed state with a spinner covering the whole UI\nresume - Unlocks the widget, triggering an internal BE request for synchronizationconst handleUpdateSession = async () => {  window._sw((api) => api.suspend());  await updateSession(session.id);  window._sw((api) => api.resume());};\n\nCopy\nHandling abandoned carts\nIn some cases customers can drop out of the checkout process early.Either\nbecause they didn't have time to complete the purchase or they went on to\ncontinue shopping on the page or for some other reason.In cases like this,\nwhen the customer returns, we want them to continue where they left off.By storing the session ID, we can fetch an existing session instead of creating a new one.This might be easier to follow in our live demo.Here's how it could be handled:\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {  initDeliveryCheckout();}, []);const initDeliveryCheckout = async () => {  const existingSessionID = window.localStorage.getItem(\"ingrid-session-id\");  if (existingSessionID) {    const getSessionResponse = await getSession(existingSessionID);    handleIngridInitialize(getSessionResponse.data.session, getSessionResponse.data.html_snippet);  } else {    handleCreateSession();

     }    });  });};\n\nCopy\nAvailable events\ndata_changed\nInstead of exposing multiple 'change' events with multiple properties, Delivery Checkout exposes one 'change' event and allows you to decide what data you care about.The callback receives two arguments\n\ndata: {  delivery_type: 'delivery' | 'mailbox' | 'pickup' | 'instore';  price: number;  search_address: {    country: string;    postal_code: string;    address_lines?: string[];    city?: string;    region?: string;  };  shipping_method: string;  external_method_id?: string;}\n\nCopy\nand\n\nmeta: {  delivery_type_changed: boolean;  external_method_id_changed: boolean;  price_changed: boolean;  search_address_changed: boolean;  shipping_method_changed: boolean;  initial_load: boolean;}\n\nCopy\nmeta.initial_load: true informs you that this is the moment where values are actually set, not updated,\nas this is the first render of the widget.All that looks kind of complicated, how does one use it?Say you want to know when the shipping price changes to update the total price on the cart\n\nwindow._sw(function (api) {  api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {    if (meta.price_changed) {      updateCart(data.price);    }  });});\n\nCopy\nIf you want to also know when the shipping method changes\n\nwindow._sw(function (api) {  api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {    if (meta.shipping_method_changed) {      sendToAnalyticsService(data.shipping_method);

 }));\n\nCopy\nCompleting session\nYou should complete the session after receiving confirmation from payment system.It marks the session as complete and creates a Transport Order in the Ingrid system.If customer address is provided during session completion and it differs from the search address used during the session lifetime, shipping options might get recalculated.The recalculation may happen when the selected shipping option was a home delivery one or the search address contained neither a country nor a postal code.Search address drives the shipping option generation during the session lifetime, but can be overridden under those conditions during session complete.Tip\nWhen issuing the complete session request, include the external order ID if possible.You can find more information about external order ID in the subsection using external order identifier.Using external order identifier\nIt is highly encouraged to pass external order identifier (external ID for short) in your session create/update/complete requests.Passing it in one of those requests will store the external ID along with the other session data.Note\nBenefits of using external ID are:\n\nbeing able to search by your external order ID in Ingrid Merchant Platform transport orders,\nwhen booking with Ingrid, your external order ID will be propagated to the booking system,\nbeing able to register and load the tracking widget using the external order ID provided by the merchant.\n\n\nYou can pass the external_id field as part of your session create/update/complete request. The following snippet shows how you can pass it in the request via curl.\n\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.ingrid.com/v1/siw/session.create' \\--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\--header 'Authorization: Bearer your-site-token' \\--data-raw '{  \"purchase_country\": \"SE\",  \"purchase_currency\": \"EUR\",  \"locale\": \"en-US\",  \"cart\": {    \"total_value\": 1000,    \"currency\": \"EUR\",    \"items\": [      {        \"sku\": \"a3ec72d0-836f-4668-9c54-5c86d67ca897\",        \"name\": \"Keyboard\",        \"quantity\": 1,        \"price\": 1000      }    ]  },  \"external_id\": \"your-order-id\"}'\n\nCopy\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nCreating a session\n\nEmbed the Delivery Checkout\n\nUpdating the cart and session\n\nHandling abandoned carts\n\nSubscribing to user events\n\nAvailable events\n\n\n\nCompleting session\n\nUsing external order identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nQlAfqLVRV53OfZz3Sf7KCGvKs0PrwHDuisfPvQTuiQ="},"67c274b4-b51b-4ed2-8659-df70c8e8fcf1":{"id_":"67c274b4-b51b-4ed2-8659-df70c8e8fcf1","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/addresses"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"059e600e-23b7-45a0-a792-97258f1a1b0b","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/addresses"},"hash":"7DZz/FGyWC+7dBlYm0DmREN1rcx4dpgOnUEmPPOjIJA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b6ad447d-eef1-4ba3-a1e2-e14112d586e4","metadata":{},"hash":"CyXOHbWdB9yRuZeutDDDMNRs9sZj8OkHj1zMPHgENAE="}},"text":"Address types overview | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

It can be filled by merchant or provided by the customer in Ingrid's Shipping Selector. Search Address must not be used with Address Form.\nPickup Location consists of information about selected pickup point. It will be empty when home delivery would be selected.\nCustomer Address - points to the customer's real address. It points to the exact place where the package will be delivered, unless delivery to the pickup point was selected. It must be provided by the merchant (at the latest at session.Complete). Customer Address must not be used with Address Form.\nDelivery Address points to the exact place where the package will be delivered, unless delivery to pickup point is selected. Delivery Address is provided by the customer via the Address Form.\nBilling Address [optional] is an address associated with your credit or debit card account. Can be used as an extra layer of protection to customer's transaction. Billing Address is provided by the customer via the Address Form.

Whenever customer selects a shipping option using the shipping\nselector widget or anything is changed in a cart, session is updated and stored.\nNote\nYou can think of a session as a set of all actions that was made by customer or on the behalf of customer during a single transaction on the merchant site.\nIf customer adds something to a cart or changes a shipping address, all the steps and information will be persisted in the session object.\n\nSession can be created through API with our Super Intelligent Widget (abbreviated and mostly known as SIW).\nSession lifecycle\nSession lifecycle consists of two states - Active and Completed.\n/session.create/session.complete/session.updateActiveCompleted\nSession is created by merchant most commonly when the user enters the checkout page.\nHowever, it might differ between some merchants, because it is the matter of the merchant integration with Ingrid services.\nAfter the session is created, it can be modified with /session.update calls to SIW API. Most common use case is updating the cart items or search address.\nHowever, there is a possibility to update more fields, see Swagger documentation to learn more.\nThe final phase of the session lifecycle is the session completion. It is done via a /session.complete call to SIW API. At this point, session must contain a customer delivery address.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nSession lifecycle\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4969,"endCharIdx":8195,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"++FgtnOO57NHt9Fx1Ut4kWsZTnZXYd60fXgr9lxzNhE="},"ff72a63c-ceda-4b9f-9d5a-840b341a459e":{"id_":"ff72a63c-ceda-4b9f-9d5a-840b341a459e","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/session"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"b7e0cf8b-03e5-4cc3-8393-fb56744f9170","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/session"},"hash":"nMtmo0aB1Ibb0RQ+AWDxXMGqFvMKEHEy/HnyCyW04bs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d835721c-90d4-49f7-8ed6-26d572b008df","metadata":{},"hash":"9Hp/nTJDS1P2YampYRrgJaTqqwSI1PMqnCY78AooRUQ="}},"text":"Session | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

Whenever customer selects a shipping option using the shipping\nselector widget or anything is changed in a cart, session is updated and stored.\nNote\nYou can think of a session as a set of all actions that was made by customer or on the behalf of customer during a single transaction on the merchant site.\nIf customer adds something to a cart or changes a shipping address, all the steps and information will be persisted in the session object.\n\nSession can be created through API with our Super Intelligent Widget (abbreviated and mostly known as SIW).\nSession lifecycle\nSession lifecycle consists of two states - Active and Completed.\n/session.create/session.complete/session.updateActiveCompleted\nSession is created by merchant most commonly when the user enters the checkout page.\nHowever, it might differ between some merchants, because it is the matter of the merchant integration with Ingrid services.\nAfter the session is created, it can be modified with /session.update calls to SIW API. Most common use case is updating the cart items or search address.\nHowever, there is a possibility to update more fields, see Swagger documentation to learn more.\nThe final phase of the session lifecycle is the session completion. It is done via a /session.complete call to SIW API. At this point, session must contain a customer delivery address.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nSession lifecycle\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4969,"endCharIdx":8195,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/t1zuPoFyJZP+5yJVnoOdJNdcRRktITcw3BtObcYQY0="},"9d29ccc3-48cc-417a-a6ee-d08e2ca619d6":{"id_":"9d29ccc3-48cc-417a-a6ee-d08e2ca619d6","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/tracking_features/multiparcel/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"3c8c2f26-5ea3-4640-a04f-fc1465842fa2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/tracking_features/multiparcel/"},"hash":"nnxUPP/11YRHseeL9/sM87ZZMIuXk5W/95GIxTT3XjE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f2d04797-f06f-4e82-8d8f-556fd58be364","metadata":{},"hash":"c4Q3YUyjVDDcOgXlub5xH7ZZmBzJXspRtArEW6NaZfk="}},"text":"Multiparcel Orders | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

With this feature, End Customers can now view both order and parcel details when their delivery is split into more than one package.\nThe landing view depends on whether the order number or tracking number was used to access the tracking details. The data is always returned for the entire order, rather than individual parcels, ensuring that consumers can access the complete order information with one request.\nBoth Tracking Widget and Tracking Page differentiate between an Order View and a Parcel View for orders fulfilled in more than one parcel. Order View lists all the parcels belonging to an order while the Parcel View shows details about the particular parcel. The End Customer can easily navigate between those two views - selecting a parcel from the Order View listing will take them to the Parcel View where a Go back to order button is available.\n\n\nTracking Page and Tracking Portal\nUsing an order identifier (e.g. external_id) in the GenerateTrackingPageLink request will result in a Tracking Page URL directing the End Customer to an Order View. Generating a URL with a parcel specific identifier (tracking_number) will take the End Customer directly to the Parcel View.\nTracking Portal works in similar manner. Providing an order id in the search form will redirect the consumer to an Order View listing all parcels. Searching with a tracking number (parcel identifier) will navigate directly to the Parcel View.\nTracking Widget\nTracking Widget follows the same logic. Passing an order identifier (directly in the rendering request or by the Search Mode) will present an Order View to the End Customer. When a tracking number is used, a Parcel View will be shown.\nRequirements\nMultiparcel Feature is build into Ingrid Delivery Tracking and does not require any additional configuration. To ensure the delivery will be recognized as a Multiparcel Order, all parcels belonging to one Order need to be linked to the same Transport Order ID in the Ingrid System. Detailed information on how to achieve it can be found in Providing Tracking Data > Parcels and Tracking Numbers section.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nOverview\n\nTracking Page and Tracking Portal\n\nTracking Widget\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4980,"endCharIdx":9000,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"OuzkkfHx31hsBq2BIOScj1P5cJLwKDvd+CXU3Q8su6Q="},"2fbfe8b0-29ef-4df5-a07c-f0b8ea290d1f":{"id_":"2fbfe8b0-29ef-4df5-a07c-f0b8ea290d1f","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/reference.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"863e6a02-5976-49fb-9c63-8cccb18da95a","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/reference.html"},"hash":"8tbiCUm1Wnw2pWRSDTBMpsrcFP8C+5JkqNKxKkXZRos="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"07c4242b-cc6b-4f71-977a-ff041b1fba9f","metadata":{},"hash":"ZAAtPq/Kugee9NjGEqQHs0OB0Slq+eBaOv4gliLKnEU="}},"text":"404 | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

token\nIn addition to tracking number and external_id, you can also use a tracking token to make requests to the GetTrackingParcels endpoint. This method requires more extensive setup, as you need to obtain a tracking token beforehand. This approach is typically employed when integrating the GetTrackingParcels endpoint with other Ingrid Delivery Tracking products, such as the Tracking Widget or Tracking Notifications.

It holds information about customer's transaction and contains available delivery options.\nWhenever something important happens; e.g. customer adds something to the cart, changes the delivery option or your backend decides to change the shipping address on behalf of the customer the session will be updated.\nThe Shipping Selector is customizable widget, that allow customers to interact with Checkout Session. It will be embedded into your e-commerce checkout page.\nIt is possible to configure the integration and customize the selector widget in our Merchant Platform.\nSession lifecycle\nThe basic lifecycle of the checkout session is presented below:\n\nWhen the customer is ready to finalize the purchase, your backend is creating a Checkout Session.\nThe Session provides HTML snippets that needs to be embedded into the checkout page.\nCustomer and your backend can interact with the session\nWhen the purchase is done, your backend is completing a Checkout Session.\nAfter the transaction, the order is eventually created.\n\nIngrid SessionIngrid APIServerIngrid SessionIngrid APIServerSession is Activeloop​Session is CompletedCustomerNavigates to checkout pageCreate Checkout SessionReturn Checkout Session with HTML snippetEmbeds the snippet into checkout pageUpdate SessionUpdate SessionComplete purchaseComplete Checkout SessionCustomer\nWhat next?\n\nIntegration prerequisites, read carefully before integration\nBackend Integration Guide\nFrontend Integration Guide\nFeatures, if you want to configure a specific aspect of the integration\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nLearn how to add a checkout widget to your e-commerce site\n\nSession lifecycle\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4980,"endCharIdx":8617,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nG37HDgU3DThNoenFfASVg2KtAQxlNPKXgUO8v5XVLc="},"ea217264-985f-4af2-a63b-486e56735b36":{"id_":"ea217264-985f-4af2-a63b-486e56735b36","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/notifications/api/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"d46405bc-b381-4051-8e44-5e5c3a5f8b9f","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/notifications/api/"},"hash":"aV7NGWPPQMouc+cXtybQpjs+1Kji4+mM9tEbLgqkjvg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"79a7d198-fb0c-4216-a937-24b661e20503","metadata":{},"hash":"mDUxt8b2ondxeUPc+nP0xWskMgEvqh//+YD0ntJQcds="}},"text":"Notifications API | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

Additionally,\nit can serve marketplace platforms (also ones with per vendor configurations).\nBoth mentioned use cases can be materialised with use of groups. Group is a set of\nitems that can differ from other groups by having different field value or condition\nmet, like different shipping dates.\nDelivery Group concept is flexible enough to handle a myriad of situations,\nlike shipping items from different warehouses,\nstores or applying custom splitting logic on integrator side to group items into sets.\nIf you don't want to use neither split shipment nor you are a marketplace,\nyour integration needs to handle only one group.\nConfiguring split shipment logic\nSplitting logic of cart items into delivery groups can be done manually by integrator.\nSplitting is done over the cart items based on the previously defined condition during\nsession create and updates.\nEach group will be mapped to a separate order.\nHandling the split shipments manually\nSplitting cart items into delivery groups can be handled manually by the integrator.\nIn order to perform the splitting, one has to define the cart.groups field\nin create/update session requests to Delivery Checkout API.\nThis powerful feature is a great fit for integrators wanting to have full control over\nthe delivery groups and split shipments or wanting to keep the split shipment logic on their side.\nExample create session request with cart items split into delivery groups can look as follows.\n\n{  \"cart\": {    \"cart_id\": \"cart-identifier\",    \"items\": [      {        \"sku\": \"sku-1\",        \"name\": \"Item name 1\",        \"price\": 900,        \"quantity\": 2      },      {        \"sku\": \"sku-2\",        \"name\": \"Item name 2\",        \"price\": 100,        \"quantity\": 2      }    ],    \"groups\": [      {        \"group_id\": \"group-1\",        \"header\": \"Delivery 1\",        \"attributes\": [\"attribute 1\", \"attribute 2\"],        \"contents\": [{ \"sku\": \"sku-1\", \"quantity\": 1 }]      },      {        \"group_id\": \"group-2\",        \"header\": \"Delivery 2\",        \"attributes\": [\"attribute 1\"],        \"contents\": [          { \"sku\": \"sku-1\", \"quantity\": 1 },          { \"sku\": \"sku-2\", \"quantity\": 2 }        ]      }    ],    \"total_value\": 2000  },  \"locales\": [\"en-US\"],  \"purchase_country\": \"SE\",  \"purchase_currency\": \"SEK\",  \"search_address\": {    \"country\": \"SE\",    \"postal_code\": \"11151\"  }}\n\nCopy\nThere are some assumptions, that should be kept in mind when using the split feature:\n\nwhen cart.groups field is provided in the request,\neach group defined in the request should have group_id and contents defined,\nwhen cart.groups field is provided in the request, all cart items should be mapped to the delivery groups,\ngroups cannot have the same group IDs,\ncart items are assigned to the groups by SKU and quantity.\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nConfiguring split shipment logic\n\nHandling the split shipments manually","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4977,"endCharIdx":9541,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IW7ghEXCwzDHlG1y7K7gqx3wgNhiAeYnofaS4sPOxl4="},"d4273e6a-f98d-44b2-b592-04f1367ccb2d":{"id_":"d4273e6a-f98d-44b2-b592-04f1367ccb2d","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/delivery_groups"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5a2d6a65-3825-4dc1-a47c-ca139c53c9cb","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/delivery_groups"},"hash":"3Tv2HBboKBtsv7axBJdLjAHsRf7itZkyxG47nn4BHjk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fa20f0c3-7962-4549-ae97-0203b07608bd","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/delivery_groups"},"hash":"HDj6rSo2Kd5kkx3FO19z7BSfMEpjTQep6mgXT7o5LEo="}},"text":"Last updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nConfiguring split shipment logic\n\nHandling the split shipments manually\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":9422,"endCharIdx":9597,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0C4kHU+Lclo1UK1tDBkXe0u0d6S+ig8OQ/iBpsMagME="},"31f5053b-f95e-45d6-bada-6a55b826f328":{"id_":"31f5053b-f95e-45d6-bada-6a55b826f328","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/upsell/integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"456cc355-4ca2-4dc8-b1d3-a6c6012c5ab6","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/upsell/integration/"},"hash":"vMSwhOmYeqC6oJZXLDXhPnHTC5AQ+R7NbgDpraT2weU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"00b8dffd-afc9-47e6-8bd6-8d49c63449b9","metadata":{},"hash":"MLrNOiz4yg6NZ8+dKQlwI26JaMSOO8/NqYfcVxqRXrs="}},"text":"Integration Guide | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

The Alerts are displayed in a form of infoboxes, appearing under the header section of the the Tracking Widget or Tracking Page when an alert-associated event is recognised by Ingrid system.\n\nThe list of supported alerts is expanding with time to offer the most up-to-date and transparent information to the End Customer. Example supported alerts include:\n\nEstimated delivery time updated,\nEstimated delivery time exceeded,\nParcel waiting to be colleted at a pickup location,\nParcel handed out for delivery,\nFailed delivery attempt,\nAwaiting supplier delivery.\n\nNote\nTracking Alerts do not require any additional configuration; they are built into the Ingrid Delivery Tracking and will work out of the box.\n\nCustom Tracking Alerts and Infobox Messages\nIngrid Delivery Tracking includes an option to display a custom message in infobox format. If you would like to inform End Customers about a specific situation and enhance the delivery experience by providing additional information (for example, extended delivery times for shipments with a certain destination country), please contact Ingrid Support Team with details of your request.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nOverview\n\nCustom Tracking Alerts and Infobox Messages\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4968,"endCharIdx":8103,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"l1XltDa9vZJTYCi5tArGlMDqEb5yNd9zz9mHBjA7ido="},"667b3983-17e8-409b-ad33-12c2142d7f7b":{"id_":"667b3983-17e8-409b-ad33-12c2142d7f7b","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/faq/integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bd1831ab-4b4c-41a2-ae18-4c708cecca9b","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/faq/integration/"},"hash":"eIHIDYgyA0rKzvUJn2dv2pQwot97/eshPmB89p9uYpM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"62f42818-d307-440a-b16c-60774e8d01a7","metadata":{},"hash":"Ri6iBRQHkz4p6wXnIhGHTAXi/9kaM/jrYZjWyAumK4s="}},"text":"Integration Guide | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

These can be found at:\n\nSIW - Swagger UI (JSON)\nDelivery Checkout - Swagger UI (JSON)\nSOM - Swagger UI (JSON)\nDelivery Tracking - Swagger UI (JSON)\n\nEnvironments\nWe have two environments that you can use:\nhttps://api-stage.ingrid.com - is our staging and testing environment where you do all the testing and developing against\nhttps://api.ingrid.com - is the production environment that you switch to when it’s time to go live\nAuthentication\nWhen you register with Ingrid you will receive an API token. This token must be send with every request in the Authorization HTTP header with the Bearer prefix followed by base64 encoded token. It will look something like this:\n\nPOST /v1/siw/session.create HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAuthorization: Bearer ZjQ1Mjk0MDMyNTNhNDdmNmIyOTI3NDE2ODUzNTU0NmI=Content-Type: application/json\n\nCopy\nEvery token is tied to specific environment thus you must use different tokens in staging or production environments.\n\nThe API token should be kept private and treated as a password. Hence all calls to our API should be done from the backend.\n\nClient Generation\nSince Ingrid's API is built on top of OpenAPI specification you can use different tools to auto-generate API clients. Two that we recommend are Autorest that works great if you are on the Dotnet stack and OpenAPI Generator that works great for the rest of the programming languages.\nBelow are two simple examples that you can use as base to generate API clients.\n.NET PHP\n\nUsing Autorest generator to generate a C# client.\n\n$ npm install -g autorest$ curl -o swagger.json https://api.ingrid.com/v1/siw/_/swagger.json$ autorest --csharp \\--clear-output-folder \\--input-file=swagger.json \\--override-client-name=SiwClient \\--namespace=Ingrid--add-credentials \\--output-folder=siw\n\nCopy\n\n\nUsing OpenAPI Generator to generate a PHP client.\n\n$ openapi-generator generate \\-i https://api.ingrid.com/v1/siw/_/swagger.json \\-g php \\-o siw\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nAPI Specification\n\nEnvironments\n\nAuthentication\n\nClient Generation\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4977,"endCharIdx":8774,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/uPaw7IMemkt96s9HqobOMSWmm9FrlaVFb5k7IvvrNo="},"83591b10-d525-4a0c-a9a3-e2a5746be484":{"id_":"83591b10-d525-4a0c-a9a3-e2a5746be484","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/som/api/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ec48e35b-26f4-41c1-a217-2119eb2f9fdf","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/som/api/"},"hash":"BZE/+Hrt7lrHBP93vdYSY1b6BqFR9/g8TIlUwmAiOVA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8498c247-7444-4436-a298-bdba2c4c6668","metadata":{},"hash":"ZVxAbXXmTUn7s6NlukwiSjrBbP8ItLfFSEuFxzrv2zU="}},"text":"SOM API | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

domain model consists of three important objects - Shipment,\nParcel and Delivery.has manyhas manyShipmentParcelsDeliveries\nGeneral Flow\nCreating a Shipment, generating labels and tracking numbers and booking pickup involves three steps.SOMClientSOMClientPOST /shipments.createReturn Shipment with Parcels and DeliveriesPOST /shipment.bookParcelsReturn Shipment with Parcels and DeliveriesPOST /deliveries.bookPickupReturn Delivery\n\nCreate a shipment.Shipment, Parcels and Deliveries are created with a single call\nto shipments.create.To generate labels and tracking numbers for a Shipment, call shipments.bookParcels.This will create labels and tracking numbers for all Deliveries in the specified Shipment.The final step is to book one or all Deliveries attached to a Shipment.This is done\nby calling deliveries.bookPickup with the tracking number as a parameter.Once a delivery has been booked, it is handled by our booking service which will\nmost often generate and upload an EDI file at a configured interval.Create Shipment\nThis call creates new shipment, parcels and deliveries at once in SOM.So\ncalled Composite Shipment.tos_id\nIf you already use our Delivery Checkout solution we highly recommend to provide tos_id in CreateShipment request, in order to connect Shipment with Order.In this case, you don't have to provide all the shipment details, Ingrid will take all the required data for the shipment from the Order.But you still will have a possibility to override TOS Order data with the data you would give in the CreateShipment request.address_return\nProvide address_return in the CreateShipment request in case you want to override a default return address.A default return address is taken from the sender address (\"address_from\") which is usually the address of your warehouse.Use case:\nAn outbound shipment is made from Sweden to Norway, however, you want an inbound shipment (return shipment) to be delivered back to Norway (your hub or warehouse).In this case, you need to provide a Norwegian address in the address return field.Request Response\n\nRequest 🔗\n\nPOST /v1/som/shipments.create HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAccept:

It is possible to add the parcel to the newly created (CreateShipment) carrier pickup that is not yet requested. If the shipment was booked using BookParcels, using AddParcel will book and generate a new label for the added parcel.\nThe endpoint also works with custom booking methods. If a return shipment is connected with the provided shipment, a parcel will be added there.\nTypical use case would be to generate labels separately for each parcel in a warehouse.\nRequest

prebooking mechanism flow.\nAfter getting familiar with this section, you will:\n\ngain an understanding of what the prebooking is,\nlearn which problems it solves and when it can be applied,\nfamiliarize yourself with general prebooking mechanism and how it works.\n\nThe big picture\nPicture yourself as a customer of an online shop operated by your favourite merchant. You decide to buy the offered goods and click the payment button to finalize your order - you pay for your order and find yourself on the order summary page soon after. But the journey of your ordered goods has just begun.\nDisclaimer\nThe following story does not reflect the true complexity of fulfilment process. It was simplified to instill an understanding of the problem space and introduce the concept of prebooking without the unnecessary cognitive load. ✨\n\nThis journey may span over couple of complex business processes, one of which is booking the delivery with the carrier of your choice. Booking indicates the readiness of shop to pass your package over to carrier, so that it gets delivered to your address. But how much time has passed between you converting (e-commerce nomenclature for finalizing your order) and the shop doing the actual booking of your package with a carrier?\nAs a customer, you probably want the answer to this question to be \"hopefully not much time\". Your carrier of choice won't know it as well, because it will get the information about the delivery the moment the shop books a delivery. However, the answer to this question can be vital from carrier standpoint, which in turn will make the delivery time as short as possible for you, the customer.\nThe carrier would be able to optimize its resources and prepare, knowing that the order has been made, but the package is not ready to be picked up yet. Uncertainty about packages can lead to longer delivery times when the carrier's resources are overloaded, be it parcel lockers or trucks. The answer to this problem is the prebooking.\nPrebooking mechanism\nPrebooking is the Ingrid service for informing the carrier about all the e-commerce carts that should be booked with the carrier (while it is not a promise). As a carrier if you want to optimize your resources planning, Ingrid prebooking gives great insights based on all merchants orders going through Ingrid Checkout.\nFrom the technical standpoint, the prebooking action is a callback to carrier API endpoint, emitted the moment that customer converts and finalizes the order. It shortens the information feedback loop about incoming packages that will be booked later by the merchant. Detailed description of webhook mechanism used for prebooking and exact message format can be found in the integration guide.\nLive React examples\nWe provide free tier of prebooking service with generous number of prebooking callbacks to carrier API per month. To learn more about tiers and limits, contact us here. 🎁\n\nUse cases\nYou can leverage prebooking to:\n\navoid over-booking the pickup points or fulfilment centres,\ngenerate shorter delivery times,\noptimize truck loads and routes,\ncreate a better customer experience.\n\nFlow\nThe sequence diagram below describes the prebooking flow between the Customer, Merchant, Ingrid Delivery Checkout API and Carrier API.\nCarrier APIIngrid Delivery Checkout APIMerchantCustomerCarrier APIIngrid Delivery Checkout APIMerchantCustomerFinalize the orderComplete the checkout sessionSend a prebooking messageReturn completed session detailsRedirect to order summary\nPrebooking flow is triggered by customer conversion through finalization of order. Request that completes the checkout session is sent to Ingrid Delivery Checkout API with additional order information (like e-mail address and phone number) and then a webhook towards carrier API is fired.\nThe webhook carries over the information about the order, such as customer information, delivery promises and addresses taking part in the delivery process (like warehouse address and delivery address).\nRight now you should be familiar with prebooking concept.

steps of\nintegrating your e-commerce site with Delivery Checkout. We'll go through patterns for\nembedding the shipping selector, handling updates to cart or customer information and\nmarking the checkout session as completed in the Delivery Checkout API.\nUsing correct endpoints for integration\nMake sure that you are using correct API endpoint when using different environments for testing and production releases.\n\nCreating a session\nThe first thing you need to do before you can embed the shipping selector in your\ncheckout page is to create a session. This is done by calling session.create which returns session details and an HTML snippet.\nEach Session has an ID that can be used to later fetch, update or\ncomplete the session. It is recommended that you store the\nsession ID together with the customer's order.\nEmbed the Delivery Checkout\nThe responses of session.create and session.pull contain the attribute\ncalled html_snippet which includes the HTML snippet to display the shipping\nselector in your checkout page. Just put it in the part of the page where you\nwant the Delivery Checkout to be displayed.\nThe snippet will then download and execute our bootstrap.js script which spawns the iframes and sets up channels of communication for session management.\n\nconst handleCreateSession = async () => {  try {    // Call your backend and they call siw/session.create    const sessionResponse = await createSession();    // Embed the widget on the page    widgetWrapperRef.current.innerHTML = HTMLSnippet;    // Trick the browser to run the script, explained below    replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));  } catch {    // We don't believe it's possible but if our service fails, you render the fallback for the widget here  }};\n\nCopy\nWarning\nIf you're dynamically inserting the HTML snippet in the DOM, most browsers won't execute the script embedded in it. If you're lucky enough to have jQuery on your page, you can use its append() function or feel free to copy the snippet below. It removes and inserts back the script nodes to trick the browser to execute them\n\nfunction replaceScriptNode(node) {  if (isScriptNode(node) && !isExternalScript(node)) {    node.parentNode.replaceChild(cloneScriptNode(node), node);  } else {    var i = 0,      children = node.childNodes;    while (i < children.length) {      replaceScriptNode(children[i++]);    }  }  return node;}function isScriptNode(node) {  return node.tagName === \"SCRIPT\";}function isExternalScript(node) {  return !!node.src && node.src !== \"\";}function cloneScriptNode(node) {  var script = document.createElement(\"script\");  script.text = node.innerHTML;  for (var i = node.attributes.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {    script.setAttribute(node.attributes[i].name, node.attributes[i].value);  }  return script;}replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));\n\nCopy\n\nCaveats\nThe HTML snippet is designed to only be added to the page once.\nSo if you are using AJAX to load the snippet you should make sure\nthat this only happens once. Adding or replacing it multiple times\nwill cause errors.\n\nWarning\nhtml_snippet contains an element with unique id shipwallet-container. Make sure there’s no other element on the page with the same ID, otherwise the widget won't load.\nYou can override the default unique id with your own by requesting a merchant configuration change from our Customer Support.\n\nUpdating the cart and session\nCheckout pages often allow the user to alter the contents of the cart, locale, customer information or anything else that the session is based on. Change in any of those may adjust the available delivery options or the visual apperance of the widget\nIn such case, you will need to update the session to inform Ingrid about the changes.\nHowever, you will also have to suspend the widget, making it non-interactive for the time of the request, and resume it after you get a response from our API.\nThis allows the widget to synchronise it's state with the backend service.\nWarning\nSuspending and resuming the widget too often will cause a poor experience for the user.\nIt's completely unnecessary when receiving user events.\nYou only want to do this if you made an api call towards update session as a result of a user interaction on your website affecting the session arguments\n\nTwo methods are exposed on the window._sw object.\n\nsuspend - Puts the widget in a freezed state with a spinner covering the whole UI\nresume - Unlocks the widget, triggering an internal BE request for synchronization","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":5571,"endCharIdx":11180,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yEJ3eocMTbp0F5KVBk5/QxQh49iaiOCyNR7Qz7QV358="},"28cb04fd-5b56-4949-91bf-dc765480971f":{"id_":"28cb04fd-5b56-4949-91bf-dc765480971f","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"cfa0700d-f4e8-434d-ab9a-20738abc8fda","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration/"},"hash":"d+wDH4ZFayTIf/oBoR/cgXwqOxGF4X2yNxuuBP30J3o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8b6c0a10-23a3-41ec-8414-c327168ed722","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration/"},"hash":"vBHuTelpV2Jy93aVejMcyhCZMmBPysq0g7z6vU+19/8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7e467489-41d6-4536-80d4-13d55d09b7c2","metadata":{},"hash":"2IIlFTabaYMq6hC/Gahq2Nx0g32QnVjgc6oYhXbIhZM="}},"text":"const handleUpdateSession = async () => {  window._sw((api) => api.suspend());  await updateSession(session.id);  window._sw((api) => api.resume());};\n\nCopy\nHandling abandoned carts\nIn some cases customers can drop out of the checkout process early. Either\nbecause they didn't have time to complete the purchase or they went on to\ncontinue shopping on the page or for some other reason. In cases like this,\nwhen the customer returns, we want them to continue where they left off.\nBy storing the session ID, we can fetch an existing session instead of creating a new one.\nHere's how it could be handled:\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {  initDeliveryCheckout();}, []);const initDeliveryCheckout = async () => {  const existingSessionID = window.localStorage.getItem(\"ingrid-session-id\");  if (existingSessionID) {    const getSessionResponse = await getSession(existingSessionID);    handleIngridInitialize(getSessionResponse.data.session, getSessionResponse.data.html_snippet);  } else {    handleCreateSession();  }};const handleIngridInitialize = (session: SIWSessionDTO, HTMLSnippet: string) => {  // session.pull and session.create should be handled the same way. We've created this utility function  // to abstract adding the snippet to the page and setting up event listeners without doubling the code  widgetWrapperRef.current!.innerHTML = HTMLSnippet;  replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));  window._sw!((api) => {    api.on(\"data_changed\", (data, meta) => {      if (meta.price_changed) {        setShippingPrice(data.price);      }    });  });};const handleCreateSession = async () => {  try {    const sessionResponse = await createSession();    handleIngridInitialize(sessionResponse.data.session, sessionResponse.data.html_snippet);    // You want to save the session ID somewhere, so when the user abandons the checkout    // you can later restore the session, instead of creating a new one    window.localStorage.setItem(\"ingrid-session-id\", sessionResponse.data.session.id);  } catch {}};\n\nCopy\nNote\nIf, for some reason, the session cannot be found when you try to call\n`session.update` or `session.pull` with a previous session ID we suggest that\nyou handle this error in this case by creating an entirely new session.\n\nSubscribing to user events\nUser can perform a number of actions that can affect your checkout, e.g. user changing the category option can cause a shipping price change.\nLuckily, the moment the widget attaches itself to the page, it sets up a Javascript API available via window._sw where you can set up listeners for events.\nYou would usually do this right after session.create or session.pull.\n\nconst handleCreateSession = async () => {  // ...call session create backend and add the snippet to the page  // Update the shipping price any time option is changed  window._sw(function (api) {    api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {      if (meta.price_changed) {        updateCart(data.price);      }    });  });};\n\nCopy\nAvailable events\nsummary_changed\nUseful when utilising Address Form and Delivery Groups features. If you don't have those enabled, you want to go with the Data Changed event.\nExposes two arguments:\n\ndata: {  // Summarised value of all delivery groups  total_value: number;  // Delivery address provided by the user in the Delivery Checkout  delivery_address: Recipient | undefined;  // Billing address provided by the user in the Delivery Checkout  billing_address: Recipient | undefined;}\n\nCopy\n\n\nmeta: {  total_value_changed: boolean;  delivery_address_changed: boolean;  billing_address_changed: boolean;}\n\nCopy\nYou can see detailed breakdown of the Recipient here\ndata_changed\nInstead of exposing multiple 'change' events with multiple properties, Delivery Checkout exposes one 'change' event and allows you to decide what data you care about.\nThe callback receives two arguments\n\ndata: {  delivery_type: 'delivery' | 'mailbox' | 'pickup' | 'instore';  price: number;  search_address: {    country: string;    postal_code: string;    address_lines?: string[];    city?: string;    region?: string;  };  shipping_method: string;  external_method_id?: string;  category_name: string;  pickup_location?: {    address: {          country: string;          postal_code: string;          address_lines: string[];          city: string;          coordinates: Coordinates;        };        name: string;  }}\n\nCopy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":11183,"endCharIdx":15581,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rzhzJa7PcTOl+rPwLqVDOUtR05+ghaEeNyMqyWPTQ04="},"7e467489-41d6-4536-80d4-13d55d09b7c2":{"id_":"7e467489-41d6-4536-80d4-13d55d09b7c2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"cfa0700d-f4e8-434d-ab9a-20738abc8fda","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration/"},"hash":"d+wDH4ZFayTIf/oBoR/cgXwqOxGF4X2yNxuuBP30J3o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"28cb04fd-5b56-4949-91bf-dc765480971f","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration/"},"hash":"zN9BY7GE+XS5lOmSpZdrJdfCgnjsfJKBpRvGd682QpE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f1b4fba1-1af7-4dfe-8031-5794f6aa2e02","metadata":{},"hash":"mCDSy8P9dtWqdp25f8S++gq0Jpu46ZAGXzMtlLowKLU="}},"text":"meta: {  delivery_type_changed: boolean;  external_method_id_changed: boolean;  price_changed: boolean;  search_address_changed: boolean;  shipping_method_changed: boolean;  initial_load: boolean;  category_name_changed: boolean;  pickup_location_changed: boolean;}\n\nCopy\nmeta.initial_load: true informs you that this is the moment where values are actually set, not updated,\nas this is the first render of the widget.\nAll that looks kind of complicated, how does one use it?\nSay you want to know when the shipping price changes to update the total price on the cart\n\nwindow._sw(function (api) {  api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {    if (meta.price_changed) {      updateCart(data.price);    }  });});\n\nCopy\nIf you want to also know when the shipping method changes\n\nwindow._sw(function (api) {  api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {    if (meta.shipping_method_changed) {      sendToAnalyticsService(data.shipping_method);    }    if (meta.price_changed) {      updateCart(data.price);    }  });});\n\nCopy\nYou can have more if statements or setup multiple data_changed event listeners if that's your jam.\nloaded\nEmitted when the widget is fully loaded and interactive.

This API method accepts a callback that runs after the Checkout Widget cleanup is complete.\n\nwindow._sw((api) =>  api.destroy(() => {    handleInitializeCheckoutWidget();  }));\n\nCopy\nCompleting session\nYou should complete the session after receiving confirmation from payment system. It marks the session as complete and creates a Transport Order in the Ingrid system.\nTip\nWhen issuing the complete session request, include the external order ID if possible. You can find more information about external order ID in the subsection using external order identifier.\n\nUsing external order identifier\nIt is highly encouraged to pass external order identifier (external ID for short) in your session create/update/complete requests.\nPassing it in one of those requests will store the external ID along with the other session data.\nNote\nBenefits of using external ID are:\n\nbeing able to search by your external order ID in Ingrid Merchant Platform transport orders,\nwhen booking with Ingrid, your external order ID will be propagated to the booking system,\nbeing able to register and load the tracking widget using the external order ID provided by the merchant.\n\n\nYou can pass the external_id field as part of your session create/update/complete request. The following snippet shows how you can pass it in the request via curl.\n\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.ingrid.com/v1/delivery_checkout/session.create' \\--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\--header 'Authorization: Bearer your-site-token' \\--data-raw '{  \"purchase_country\": \"SE\",  \"purchase_currency\": \"SEK\",  \"locales\": [    \"sv-SE\"  ],  \"search_address\": {    \"postal_code\": \"11239\",    \"country\": \"SE\"  },  \"cart\": {      \"cart_id\": \"unique_id\",      \"total_value\": 129900,      \"currency\": \"SEK\",      \"items\": [        {          \"sku\": \"SKU12345\",          \"name\": \"Saucony Shadow 6000\",          \"quantity\": 1,          \"price\": 1000        }      ]   },  \"external_id\": \"your-order-id\"}'\n\nCopy\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":15584,"endCharIdx":19891,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"INAkUJbMvH0Kr+PXetaB8inJItgEPrsST/nMfHcqVHQ="},"f1b4fba1-1af7-4dfe-8031-5794f6aa2e02":{"id_":"f1b4fba1-1af7-4dfe-8031-5794f6aa2e02","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"cfa0700d-f4e8-434d-ab9a-20738abc8fda","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration/"},"hash":"d+wDH4ZFayTIf/oBoR/cgXwqOxGF4X2yNxuuBP30J3o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7e467489-41d6-4536-80d4-13d55d09b7c2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration/"},"hash":"2IIlFTabaYMq6hC/Gahq2Nx0g32QnVjgc6oYhXbIhZM="}},"text":"On page\n\n\nCreating a session\n\nEmbed the Delivery Checkout\n\nUpdating the cart and session\n\nHandling abandoned carts\n\nSubscribing to user events\n\nAvailable events\n\n\n\nCompleting session\n\nUsing external order identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":19884,"endCharIdx":20155,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/aL39nzOPrDW/p8JPGMg3HWdXbn0UwiMbMzmKZp2BZo="},"54770535-6508-412a-8568-3bd1bf598f03":{"id_":"54770535-6508-412a-8568-3bd1bf598f03","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/backend_integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"da69e9e6-0861-4263-9a3e-cf1a6c1a4cb2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/backend_integration/"},"hash":"Z4LqF1fHQHrzXJ6K1uPBF6+sl+4cyLPfEPDF2vIlXyw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7d7996fc-e980-40d6-abdd-6fa0eff4c1bb","metadata":{},"hash":"gt9qn+zOlSfG6AXdS4VNDf5SE65UMKW80Dr97iTAT7c="}},"text":"Backend Integration Quickstart | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

Additionally,\nit can serve marketplace platforms (also ones with per vendor configurations).\nBoth mentioned use cases can be materialised with use of groups. Group is a set of\nitems that can differ from other groups by having different field value or condition\nmet, like different shipping dates.\nDelivery Group concept is flexible enough to handle a myriad of situations,\nlike shipping items from different warehouses,\nstores or applying custom splitting logic on integrator side to group items into sets.\nIf you don't want to use neither split shipment nor you are a marketplace,\nyour integration needs to handle only one group.\nConfiguring split shipment logic\nSplitting logic of cart items into delivery groups can be done manually by integrator.\nSplitting is done over the cart items based on the previously defined condition during\nsession create and updates.\nEach group will be mapped to a separate order.\nHandling the split shipments manually\nSplitting cart items into delivery groups can be handled manually by the integrator.\nIn order to perform the splitting, one has to define the cart.groups field\nin create/update session requests to Delivery Checkout API.\nThis powerful feature is a great fit for integrators wanting to have full control over\nthe delivery groups and split shipments or wanting to keep the split shipment logic on their side.\nExample create session request with cart items split into delivery groups can look as follows.\n\n{  \"cart\": {    \"cart_id\": \"cart-identifier\",    \"items\": [      {        \"sku\": \"sku-1\",        \"name\": \"Item name 1\",        \"price\": 900,        \"quantity\": 2      },      {        \"sku\": \"sku-2\",        \"name\": \"Item name 2\",        \"price\": 100,        \"quantity\": 2      }    ],    \"groups\": [      {        \"group_id\": \"group-1\",        \"header\": \"Delivery 1\",        \"attributes\": [\"attribute 1\", \"attribute 2\"],        \"contents\": [{ \"sku\": \"sku-1\", \"quantity\": 1 }]      },      {        \"group_id\": \"group-2\",        \"header\": \"Delivery 2\",        \"attributes\": [\"attribute 1\"],        \"contents\": [          { \"sku\": \"sku-1\", \"quantity\": 1 },          { \"sku\": \"sku-2\", \"quantity\": 2 }        ]      }    ],    \"total_value\": 2000  },  \"locales\": [\"en-US\"],  \"purchase_country\": \"SE\",  \"purchase_currency\": \"SEK\",  \"search_address\": {    \"country\": \"SE\",    \"postal_code\": \"11151\"  }}\n\nCopy\nThere are some assumptions, that should be kept in mind when using the split feature:\n\nwhen cart.groups field is provided in the request,\neach group defined in the request should have group_id and contents defined,\nwhen cart.groups field is provided in the request, all cart items should be mapped to the delivery groups,\ngroups cannot have the same group IDs,\ncart items are assigned to the groups by SKU and quantity.\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nConfiguring split shipment logic\n\nHandling the split shipments manually","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4977,"endCharIdx":9541,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MOsLRsZwDK131z7HqLtzQ+xIT0JU9Xo33q92P4JPemM="},"3f575604-3489-49c4-aaa4-c6849a5561d8":{"id_":"3f575604-3489-49c4-aaa4-c6849a5561d8","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/delivery_groups/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9c3d6396-43b9-47ba-a946-f4a708ff9bdb","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/delivery_groups/"},"hash":"+awx/DUs4B9CuO+HrLSemvXfgeoyUQDDIN+tsUH7lt4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7f26a5ba-d430-4f94-9f44-a64a70cafd1b","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/delivery_groups/"},"hash":"HDj6rSo2Kd5kkx3FO19z7BSfMEpjTQep6mgXT7o5LEo="}},"text":"Last updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nConfiguring split shipment logic\n\nHandling the split shipments manually\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":9422,"endCharIdx":9597,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"w68CNKgWdJzhftG5fBJ1Y7nXWli0FVV52qxQci18e1c="},"8b6189c6-b747-4ada-8330-904002248da6":{"id_":"8b6189c6-b747-4ada-8330-904002248da6","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/address_form/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"341c63a8-40dd-4c6a-993e-cfe2bd286e20","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/address_form/"},"hash":"B0s5XSouLEeQ2yG49MPtuGJpE5RhdAC0C8zY6XPN964="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2f76c931-74d6-4c2c-82bc-6a64486929d2","metadata":{},"hash":"lNwg4HDShxdgdiDhro9VZlimhCqrIHYN2K9Cw864om8="}},"text":"Address form | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

Customer input validation takes the regional address formats into the account.\n\nEnabling the address form\nAddress form is disabled by default in the Delivery Checkout API configuration. You can enable the address form by requesting it from Ingrid Support here.\nAddress form support\nIntegration with Delivery Checkout API is needed in order to use the address form solution. If you are planning to upgrade from the SIW API, please see the upgrade checklist.\n\nLayout and validation rules\nWe provide you with the option to customize the layout of the address form, akin to arranging a puzzle. You have the flexibility to select fields, adjust their width, and establish validation rules for precise and accurate data input.\nAdditionally, you can create presets for each country, allowing for distinct layouts and validation criteria. Should you need any assistance or wish to discuss customization, our Ingrid Support team is readily available to assist you.\nWe support form fields as follows:\n\nNAME\nFIRST_NAME\nLAST_NAME\nADDRESS_LINE\nSTREET\nSTREET_NUMBER\nAPARTMENT_NUMBER\nPOSTAL_CODE\nCITY\nREGION\nPHONE_NUMBER\nEMAIL\nVAT\nCOMPANY_NAME\nCARE_OF\nFLOOR\nNATIONAL_IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4974,"endCharIdx":7952,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HJE+6nTpYgdhsXTTF83DhA0GjrQWdtkiuGsMuvwBuYc="},"6c6e8b63-dcaf-420c-bd02-788a75bc4b4b":{"id_":"6c6e8b63-dcaf-420c-bd02-788a75bc4b4b","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/address_form/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"341c63a8-40dd-4c6a-993e-cfe2bd286e20","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/address_form/"},"hash":"B0s5XSouLEeQ2yG49MPtuGJpE5RhdAC0C8zY6XPN964="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2f76c931-74d6-4c2c-82bc-6a64486929d2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/address_form/"},"hash":"lNwg4HDShxdgdiDhro9VZlimhCqrIHYN2K9Cw864om8="}},"text":"Regional trends\nIngrid address form is following the regional trends. Set of field inputs and required fields are dependent based on the country of the customer. Inline addresses visualised in the address book are taking the regional trends into account as well.\nIn the picture below you can see the behaviour of the autocomplete solution that is shipped along the address form. Its output is based on the country of the customer too and aids the process of entering the address to a great extent.\n\nValidating the inputs\nAll inputs of the address form are validated. This helps to decrease the number of parcels, which need the correction of the address in the warehouse.\n\nDeliveries are our bread and butter at Ingrid. We observed that certain countries have a lot of regional trends in the way the addresses are provided by customers, such as ordering of address parts and using region-specific abbreviations. Using address form can reduce warehouse unexpected additional operational costs.\n\nWe understand that business needs can sometimes demand unique rules. That's why we offer customizable validation rules, allowing you the flexibility to configure them according to your preferences.\nRequired\nYou can define which inputs are required to proceed with the checkout process. Additionally, you have the option to create input groups, specifying that only one (or more) of them is necessary. Once this condition is met, the remaining inputs in that group will be marked as optional.\nFor instance, consider the address form where the First Name, Last Name, and Email fields are grouped as required inputs, with only one of them needed to fulfill the condition.\n\nLength\nYou have the flexibility to establish length validation for an individual input or a set of inputs. This allows you to define both minimum and maximum character limits for a combined group of inputs. Consequently, within that group, the total character count is restricted to the specified limits.\nFor example, the address form can be configured to ensure that the combined character count of First Name and Last Name inputs does not exceed 10 characters.\n\nAutocomplete validation\nWe continually strive to validate the information provided to minimize the risk of incorrect shipments. Therefore, our autocomplete solution incorporates a fallback scenario. In instances where only a street name is provided without a number, the input will be divided into two separate fields: Street and Street number.\nThe following scenario illustrates how our autocomplete feature will respond if you attempt to proceed with the checkout without providing a street number or without utilizing our autocomplete suggestions from the list.\n\nUpon clicking Continue, we will validate the address you provided. If we are unable to locate it or observe that an address line isn't filled properly , we will separate the Street and Number field and notify customer about the missing or wrong data.\n\nBilling address\nThe address form provides options to enable or disable various features that can contribute to achieving distinct delivery goals.\nCertain situations may necessitate providing distinct address details for billing purposes. In our address form, you can easily enable the visibility and requirement of a billing address in your checkout process.\nBilling address layout\nIn certain cases, the billing address may differ from the delivery address. We offer you the flexibility to configure the billing address separately, allowing you to determine its appearance and required information. As illustrated below, the billing address can significantly vary from the delivery address in the examples above.\n\nBilling address validation rules\nThis also extends to billing address validation rules, allowing you to set them individually for both billing and delivery addresses.\n\nReadonly fields when prefilled\nWe offer support for making input fields readonly when recipient data is sourced from an external system. In such cases, these frozen fields remain unchangeable during the initial visit.\n\nAddress book\nCustomer addresses are persisted for future use in an address book. Address book takes the burden of providing and switching between address off the customer.\nComplying to GDPR\nWe are complying to GDPR regulations when it comes to handling data. All data persisted in the Ingrid platform can be removed on customer's request. In order to remove customer data, please request it via contacting Ingrid Support here.\n\nHide address book\nThe Address Book is a valuable tool designed to conveniently store multiple addresses in one place for future use. However, we understand that there are instances when it may not be needed. That's why we offer you the option to disable the Address Book.\nWhen this feature is disabled, new addresses will continue to be added in the background, ensuring that your Address Book remains up-to-date. So, even if you choose to temporarily hide it, when you decide to re-enable the Address Book, you'll find that it contains all the addresses you've added during that time. While the Address Book is disabled, users will have the ability to add and edit a single delivery address.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nAddress form\n\nEnabling the address form\n\nLayout and validation rules\n\nRegional trends\n\nValidating the inputs\n\nBilling address\n\nReadonly fields when prefilled\n\nAddress book\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":7955,"endCharIdx":13399,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"xzdxJVD3K/3Yf/sYFnGFzai1mn1JMrKe4n6FPV/AB/8="},"874a45d3-6157-4621-83cb-6afdd9e4005a":{"id_":"874a45d3-6157-4621-83cb-6afdd9e4005a","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/react_example/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"38649834-b654-4498-b395-bc13751589db","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/react_example/"},"hash":"0CAanyNKnaMre+Ih/TQmR5zko1bIP/MLvsiZcNqMN1s="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9e0a4009-0c53-48b9-a765-0af567ed2d60","metadata":{},"hash":"QMuFReRKjniFn7CmpVAqwt9q950yzLxGpWWXm83nxsc="}},"text":"React Example | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

A merchant can have one or more sites, which are online shops operated by that merchant.\nSite\nA single shop or website (more precisely a web application) where offerings to customers are made that is operated by the merchant. Each site is uniquely identified for a merchant.\nCarrier\nA party that performs the delivery of the actual parcels and packages sent by the merchant to their customers, e.g. your country's national postal services (if Ingrid integrates with them).\nConfiguration\nThe underlying settings for how Ingrid products will work in the specific site setting. Configuration enables merchants to control and customise how the Ingrid products work such as: adding carrier products to their offering, adjust delivery prices, turn on/off product features etc.\nSession\nMain object of the Delivery Checkout product. It has its own separate section in our development documentation.\nDelivery Group\nRepresents a group of cart items that will be delivered to the customer in separate packages.\nIt has its own separate section in our development documentation.\nCarrier product\nDelivery products that are offered from carriers to merchants. Carriers define their products and Ingrid integrates with them. It is separate from the shipping method, because the merchant can customise the details of the carrier product by setting e.g. price/price rules and when to offer the carrier product.\nNote\nTo use a carrier product, it has to be applied to Ingrid configuration in the Ingrid Merchant Platform for the given site.\n\nShipping method\nIt is the Ingrid internal representation of a delivery method that can be used in an Ingrid context. Shipping methods represents carrier products. Shipping methods are carrier product specific. A Shipping method can be an express home delivery or a pickup point delivery.\nNote\nUser of Ingrid Merchant Platform assigns carrier products while they are operated as Shipping methods in Ingrid.\n\nCategory\nAlso known as delivery category. The entity that defines a delivery offering that will be selectable in the Delivery Checkout for the consumer. Categories contains carrier products (represented as shipping methods). Merchant can customise the delivery categories by controlling what the Delivery category offerings is in terms of e.g. base Delivery Time, Delivery Time format (weekday vs. date) etc.\nCategory option\nA concrete delivery choice selected by the customer. For example, we have a category to a pickup point, that presents the user a list of 20 pickup points to choose from. A single choice is a category option, even though they all belong to the same category.\nOrder\nIt is a representation of a completed session. Order holds all the necessary information about the result of user interaction with the Delivery Checkout needed to fulfill the delivery, such as cart information, delivery address, customer details and others.\nNote\nIngrid order is intended to be related with an order in the merchant's e-commerce system. The linking can be done by using external_id field.\n\nShipment\nIt is an order we began fulfilling. Shipment consists of data required by the carrier to make a delivery i.e. addresses, parcel details and delivery times. It can be created based on data held in order alone, but it can also be customized to represent complex scenarios (return deliveries, duty declarations, consolidated deliveries).\nIngrid Merchant Platform (IMP)\nIt is the administration portal for Ingrid clients. It can be used to manage orders, configure widgets, track shipments and more.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nMerchant\n\nSite\n\nCarrier\n\nConfiguration\n\nSession\n\nDelivery Group\n\nCarrier product\n\nShipping method\n\nCategory\n\nCategory option\n\nOrder\n\nShipment\n\nIngrid Merchant Platform (IMP)\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":5559,"endCharIdx":10650,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"V24V1k2qTV9yBxej22Sj9mCaSpkf49BOLwXtBlxqZjQ="},"5b916b94-496a-48d0-96a2-b45d5c485998":{"id_":"5b916b94-496a-48d0-96a2-b45d5c485998","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/som/reference/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e261e3b9-b363-4daf-9f1d-c727f739318c","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/som/reference/"},"hash":"aWR6yp6h2gN35fc3oe+7XzwTA7MjYNTK+kH4+AViJFo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8966e32a-ecc0-46b2-bf62-a963e69da46d","metadata":{},"hash":"IN1S2NIVVmV1EWKqekr6puQJJ8AIK8JIB8qDKaqspnw="}},"text":"Reference | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

Shipping selector embedded on your checkout page and all frontend-related integration parts remain the same.\nIntegration with Delivery Checkout API requires minor changes for handling the response bodies structure. The response payload resembles the payload from SIW API. Some new fields were introduced though and naming of top-level result field was changed to delivery_groups.\nBenefits of upgrade\nYou should upgrade to new Delivery Checkout API in order to benefit from new features, such as address form, split shipments handling or marketplaces handling.\nUpgrade checklist\nThe following checklist aims to simplify the process of upgrade to our new Delivery Checkout API.\n\nGet familiar with the new API (you will quickly notice that it is not different from the Swagger of SIW API).\nDecide whether you want to handle split shipments, if so - decide the split condition that should be applied to cart items.\nContact Ingrid Support Team here. We will guide you through the process of setting up the split condition logic.\nHandle delivery_groups field from the response payloads in your integration - if you are using single cart setting, your delivery_groups field will contain only one delivery group (a single delivery group is similar to result from SIW API).\nDecide when you want to fetch sessions with fresh shipping options and when session states with possibly stale shipping options (by expiration time slots) are acceptable. Depending on the decision, use session.pull or session.get respectively. To learn more about differences between those two endpoints, consult the session.pull endpoint documentation.\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nBenefits of upgrade\n\nUpgrade checklist\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4988,"endCharIdx":8555,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+H6GD51sRNOo64R4WbOYWCbPIw0esNHJL88X3fiKMpA="},"059dec14-fce7-4456-87ba-aba6ef52f9e4":{"id_":"059dec14-fce7-4456-87ba-aba6ef52f9e4","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/instore/pcp/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"1adf1565-907e-4f57-8d22-7b28da401106","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/instore/pcp/"},"hash":"quHP8lV8SVUSkK3zPIgxbfDzztyTXnBx8JziZL8eE4U="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f5b1901e-7ce5-4408-b082-3bf75b673a54","metadata":{},"hash":"/wwRc9g3IGi/MUQxHXHYEFHuGLLWRAzrCi1PUG/7Jxc="}},"text":"Public Carrier Protocol | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

As an integrator you will provide information shipment data to the platform. You will also receive information back to your systems when different events occur, i.e. a parcel has been delivered. Ingrid will provide you with the necessary credentials to connect to the platform.\nThese are the steps involved in a typical delivery journey\nWhen the carrier receives a shipment booking, the carrier pre-advice the platform with shipment data.\nThe parcel is arrival scanned at the store and the platform notifies the carrier that a parcel has been received and is ready to be picked up by consumer\nThe carrier notifies the consumer that the parcel is ready to be picked up\nThe consumer identifies themselves with a pre-authenticated QR code or an identity document. The platform requests validation from the carrier. If everything is ok, the parcel is handed out to the consumer.\nThe platform notifies the carrier that the parcel has been delivered.\nSequence diagrams\nPre Advise\nService Point / LockerIngrid PCPCarrierService Point / LockerIngrid PCPCarrierUpsertParcelUpsertParcel\nIngestion\nCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / LockerCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / Lockeralt[Pre advised parcelnot found]Scan codeQuery(code)Search pre-advised parcelQuery(code)Parcel dataParcel dataAccept parcelIngested(parcel)Ingested(parcel)Notify recipient\nDelivery\nCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / LockerCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / Lockeralt[Parcel accpeted byrecipient][Parcle refused bycustomer]Scan receive codeQuery(receive code)Query(receive code)OKOKHand out parcelDeliveredDeliveredRefused reasonRefused reason\n1st mile (Send / Customer return)\nCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / LockerCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / LockerScan drop off codeQuery(code)Query(code)Parcel dataParcel dataAccept parcelAccepted(parcel)Accepted(parcel)\nOverdue returns\nCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / LockerCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / Lockerloop[Loop over returns]List pending returnsHandleReturns(tracking numbers)/parcel/returnedParcel dataParcel data\nAPI\nIn-Store side endpoints\nUpsert parcel 🔗\nPre-advise parcel or to update already stored parcel/ For Ingrid to work as efficiently as possible it is required by the carrier to keep the In-Store system up-to-date with current parcel information. This includes pre-advicing parcel, that is, provide information about parcels which has been booked for a certain location. It also includes updating parcels already at location, i.e. if a parcel should be recalled to the merchant ahead of time.\nCarrier side endpoints\nQuery a parcel\nQuery parcel by a given code.

This integrated solution empowers Customers with real-time delivery updates, ensuring they stay informed at every step of their order journey. The Ingrid Hosted Solution is built around two key components:\nTracking Portal: A centralised hub for End Customers to effortlessly search for and track their orders.\nTracking Page: A dedicated page where Customers can access detailed information about their parcels - including delivery status, ETA, and any relevant updates - similar to the Tracking Widget. Following a successful search, Tracking Portal redirects Customers to Tracking Page.\nUsing Tracking Portal\nTo direct End Customers to the Ingrid Tracking Portal, simply provide them with the following link:\n\nhttps://tracking.ingrid.com/\n\nCopy\nTo pre-populate the search field on the Tracking Portal with specific contact information and parcel identifier, include two query parameters (prefillContact and prefillIdentifier) in the URL:\n\nhttps://tracking.ingrid.com/?prefillContact=<EMAIL>&prefillIdentifier=<ORDER/TRACKING NUMBER>\n\nCopy\nURL Encoding\nEnsure that the <EMAIL> and <ORDER/TRACKING NUMBER> values in the query parameters are properly URL-encoded to avoid any issues with special characters. For example, an email like user@example.com should be encoded as user%40example.com.\n\nThe URL to Tracking Portal can be localized by adding a locale after .ingrid.com part:\n\nhttps://tracking.ingrid.com/<LOCALE>/\n\nCopy\n\nUsing Tracking Page\nThe Ingrid Tracking Page offers two ways for customers to access their delivery information.\n\nPublic View:\n\n\nEasier to integrate with.\nRequires End Customers to enter an email in the Tracking Widget to access full tracking data.\nHides sensitive information like home delivery address to ensure privacy.\n\n\nPrivate View:","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4984,"endCharIdx":8491,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jjEwUftCFLKQf+Rumd++nEz6SDUTuuCTGX2gXBLBGXA="},"eb1a051b-cbdc-4011-a846-9ea83dd2c645":{"id_":"eb1a051b-cbdc-4011-a846-9ea83dd2c645","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/ingrid_hosted_page_and_portal"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"4b145153-2e1a-4cf7-918b-15e5c426c538","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/ingrid_hosted_page_and_portal"},"hash":"+8CSu7YpnIewVa+TcC5aNcoCmqdmkkbIsb1F3o4v02Y="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"be282e98-71a1-4abb-bac1-46b8542f73ad","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/ingrid_hosted_page_and_portal"},"hash":"94uPhNAP+ujSqNN8VBpx0rcs8+HP9My0RB8l/NJSt8s="}},"text":"Easier to integrate with.\nRequires End Customers to enter an email in the Tracking Widget to access full tracking data.\nHides sensitive information like home delivery address to ensure privacy.\n\n\nPrivate View:\n\n\nRequires integration with Ingrid's Delivery Tracking API.\nOffers seamless access for End Customers to their tracking information, requiring no additional action from them.\n\nPublic View is ideal when you prioritise faster integration and less development effort, with a downside of requiring an extra step from the End Customers.\nPrivate View is ideal when you are seeking a truly frictionless experience for customers, prioritizing their convenience and data privacy.\nPublic View\nA link to the public view can be constructed simply by taking Ingrid Transport Order ID (TOS ID) and adding /order/<TRANSPORT_ORDER_ID> to the base Tracking Portal URL:\n\nhttps://tracking.ingrid.com/order/<TRANSPORT_ORDER_ID>\n\nCopy\nA public URL can be localized by adding locale after .ingrid.com part:\n\nhttps://tracking.ingrid.com/<LOCALE>/order/<TRANSPORT_ORDER_ID>\n\nCopy\nPrivate View\nA direct link to private Tracking Page view can be obtained using GenerateTrackingPageLink endpoint:\n\nPOST v1/delivery_tracking/generate_tracking_page_linkHost: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer <BASE64-ENCODED-API-TOKEN>{    \"locale\": \"en-US\",    \"order_id\": \"592978\",    \"site_id\": \"11756e4a98c64fa9a9c5d627fd88a236\"}\n\nCopy\n\norder_id can be populated with either external_id or TOS_ID.\nlocale adjusts the language of Tracking Page.

A single order may consist of multiple parcels, and each parcel can be tracked independently. However, well before a tracking number is assigned and the parcel is entrusted to the carrier for delivery, a wealth of information can be made available to the end consumer at the order level, enhancing the overall Tracking Experience.\nThere are multiple paths for providing Orders to Ingrid Tracking, depending on your Ingrid Products combination.\nUsing Ingrid Delivery Checkout\nIngrid Delivery Checkout (V1 and V2) and Ingrid Delivery Tracking work together for automatic order tracking. After a checkout session is completed, created order will be recognised by Delivery Tracking out of the box, making all the relevant data leveraged to deliver a comprehensive and satisfying Customer Experience.\nUsing Ingrid Transport Administration\nOrders created directly from shipments in Ingrid Transport Administration (without Delivery Checkout) are automatically recognized and tracked by Delivery Tracking.\nRegistering orders created outside the Ingrid System\nThe most straightforward way of sourcing tracking orders is through Delivery Checkout and Ingrid Transport Automation service. However, if you use Ingrid Delivery Tracking exclusively or need to track orders that did not originate in another Ingrid system, you can still track them by providing all the necessary information using CreateTrackingOrder endpoint.\nTo register an exteral order, you need to make a POST request to v1/delivery_tracking/order\nRequest Response","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4968,"endCharIdx":8274,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"9w3oE5TPcaDys7pnSti9kBNfugRw9Fkt/fRTZf59jXA="},"2d0a59da-9ce0-442e-adaf-a2046c8c6882":{"id_":"2d0a59da-9ce0-442e-adaf-a2046c8c6882","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/providing_data/orders/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"432c9e14-97e4-4dc6-b360-2d62b06e24e2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/providing_data/orders/"},"hash":"UTPAI+cBK4BbudOM2kdvNVmqbrM1UoMAzbYU+HxG+EI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8153c62a-048f-4895-a32d-42d239870fa8","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/providing_data/orders/"},"hash":"WYnyLe9v1uuWmZLbNkRnbGPhz2N/lj8bU8HiOlfdzj0="}},"text":"POST v1/delivery_tracking/orderHost: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer <BASE64-ENCODED-API-TOKEN>{  \"site_id\": <site_id>,  \"external_id\": \"order456\",  \"carrier_product_ref\": \"carrier123\",  \"delivery_type\": \"PICKUP\",  \"promises\": {    \"estimated_submission_time\": {      \"start\": \"2023-11-07T12:30:00Z\",      \"end\": \"2023-11-07T14:30:00Z\"    },    \"estimated_delivery_time\": {      \"start\": \"2023-11-07T15:00:00Z\",      \"end\": \"2023-11-07T17:00:00Z\"    }  },  \"sender\": {    \"name\": \"John Doe\",    \"address\": {      \"street\": \"123 Main St\",      \"city\": \"Stockholm\",      \"postal_code\": \"12345\",      \"country\": \"SE\"    }  },  \"receiver\": {    \"name\": \"Jane Smith\",    \"email\": \"jane@example.com\",    \"phone_number\": \"123-456-7890\",    \"address\": {      \"street\": \"456 Elm St\",      \"city\": \"Gothenburg\",      \"postal_code\": \"54321\",      \"country\": \"SE\"    }  },  \"destination\": {    \"address\": {      \"street\": \"789 Oak St\",      \"city\": \"Malmö\",      \"postal_code\": \"67890\",      \"country\": \"SE\"    },    \"operational_hours\": {      \"mon\": [],      \"tue\": [        {          \"start\": \"2023-11-07T10:00:00Z\",          \"end\": \"2023-11-07T16:00:00Z\"        }      ],      \"wed\": [],      \"thu\": [],      \"fri\": [],      \"sat\": [],      \"sun\": []    },    \"location_external_id\": \"location456\",    \"location_type\": \"LOCKER\"  },  \"cart\": {    \"items\": [      {        \"sku\": \"item123\",        \"name\": \"Product A\",        \"quantity\": 2,        \"price\": 2000,        \"discount\": 100,        \"image\": \"https://example.com/productA.jpg\"      },      {        \"sku\": \"item456\",        \"name\": \"Product B\",        \"quantity\": 1,        \"price\": 1500,        \"discount\": 0,        \"image\": \"https://example.com/productB.jpg\"      }    ],    \"total\": 4400,    \"discount\": 100,    \"shipping_price\": 200,    \"currency\": \"SEK\"  }}\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 10 May 2022 13:25:51 GMTContent-Type: application/jsonConnection: closeVary: Accept-Encodingx-trace-id: D20220314132550W4T98CK0A6AEQ72X{  \"id\": \"tracking_order_id123\"}\n\nCopy\n\n\nNote\nThe id obtained in the response can be used as tos_id while registering tracking parcels.\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nUsing Ingrid Delivery Checkout\n\nUsing Ingrid Transport Administration\n\nRegistering orders created outside the Ingrid System\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":8277,"endCharIdx":10686,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"JCganSMahW+HRs6caYdMyp5U0/wQhkGxOD15rLvFdQo="},"a1fc700b-accf-44a9-b13e-f50823dee17f":{"id_":"a1fc700b-accf-44a9-b13e-f50823dee17f","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/widget_integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"817bf080-ca67-4ba4-befa-07f86f59aaca","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/widget_integration/"},"hash":"NQWdmDJbFHNKdl+s/vKL/0SGPtSkfL+G712UTe1gM80="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"50ef0f6a-244d-4630-b9b2-69fc1b03490a","metadata":{},"hash":"O1Jt6+ucxQFzDgQIjb2V9GuOaHYkMBFG3BaUH1j4BMo="}},"text":"Tracking Widget Integration | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

The most common approach involves creating a dedicated Tracking Page within the Merchant's domain specifically designed to accommodate the Tracking Widget. The End Customer can then be provided with a link to said Tracking Page, which includes the embedded Tracking Widget.\nEmbedding Delivery Tracking Widget\n\nLoad Tracking Widget code:\n\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.ingrid.com/delivery-tracking/bootstrap.js\"></script>\n\nCopy\n\nSelect which element of the page should be the Tracking Widget container and give it a unique id. For example:\n\n\n<div id=\"delivery-tracking-widget\"></div>\n\nCopy\nWidget dimentions\nThe Delivery Tracking Widget has a minimum width of 320px to guarantee readability. It lacks a maximum width, allowing it to stretch and fill its container entirely. The widget's height adjusts dynamically based on its content.\n\nWidget modes\nThere are two ways to initialize the Tracking Widget: search mode and private mode. Search mode is used to display a search form where the end user can look up their package. Private mode displays full information about the given package.\n\n\n\nAfter the script is loaded, initialize the Tracking Widget using JavaScript.\nTo initialize search mode use the renderSearchMode method:\n\nwindow.IngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi.renderSearchMode({  containerId: \"delivery-tracking-widget\",  locale: \"<LOCALE>\",  siteId: \"<YOUR_SITE_ID_FROM_IMP>\",});\n\nCopy\nTo render in private mode, use the renderPrivateMode method:\n\nwindow.IngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi.renderPrivateMode({  containerId: \"delivery-tracking-widget\",  locale: \"<LOCALE>\",  siteId: \"<YOUR_SITE_ID_FROM_IMP>\",  identifier: \"<IDENTIFIER>\",  contact: \"<EMAIL>\",});\n\nCopy\n\n\nFollowing a method call to render mode, the Tracking Widget should appear on the page.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4989,"endCharIdx":8454,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"FUDhtO+HRLXYkeXweMMtOIOwxzpgtjPJVbMkfOdrM34="},"9c2c5353-8d6c-4bab-9a47-36d7f3bfe90e":{"id_":"9c2c5353-8d6c-4bab-9a47-36d7f3bfe90e","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/widget_integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"817bf080-ca67-4ba4-befa-07f86f59aaca","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/widget_integration/"},"hash":"NQWdmDJbFHNKdl+s/vKL/0SGPtSkfL+G712UTe1gM80="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"50ef0f6a-244d-4630-b9b2-69fc1b03490a","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/widget_integration/"},"hash":"O1Jt6+ucxQFzDgQIjb2V9GuOaHYkMBFG3BaUH1j4BMo="}},"text":"After the script is loaded, initialize the Tracking Widget using JavaScript.\nTo initialize search mode use the renderSearchMode method:\n\nwindow.IngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi.renderSearchMode({  containerId: \"delivery-tracking-widget\",  locale: \"<LOCALE>\",  siteId: \"<YOUR_SITE_ID_FROM_IMP>\",});\n\nCopy\nTo render in private mode, use the renderPrivateMode method:\n\nwindow.IngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi.renderPrivateMode({  containerId: \"delivery-tracking-widget\",  locale: \"<LOCALE>\",  siteId: \"<YOUR_SITE_ID_FROM_IMP>\",  identifier: \"<IDENTIFIER>\",  contact: \"<EMAIL>\",});\n\nCopy\n\n\nFollowing a method call to render mode, the Tracking Widget should appear on the page.\n\n\nIngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi\nSearch mode\nIngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi.renderSearchMode function expects as argument an options object with 2 required properties:\n\ncontainerId: HTML id of the container to inject the Tracking Widget into\nsiteId: Id of the site (use IMP to get your siteId)\n\nOptional properties are:\n\nlocale: Adjusts the language - by default, the Tracking Widget will use en-US.

See Supported Languages.\n\nPassing arguments to IngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi\nIt is up to you how you pass arguments to IngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi, but we recommend that you take identifier and contact from query parameters.\nFor example, the link to your site can look like this:\n\nhttps://tracking/?identifier=<TRACKING_NUMBER>&contact=<CONTACT>\n\nCopy\nThen you can extract identifier and contact from query paramaters.\nExample in Search mode:\n\nconst params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);const identifier = params.get(\"identifier\");const contact = params.get(\"contact\");window.IngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi.renderSearchMode({  containerId: \"delivery-tracking-widget\",  siteId: \"<YOUR_SITE_ID_FROM_IMP>\",  locale: \"<LOCALE>\",  prefillIdentifier: identifier,  prefillContact: contact,});\n\nCopy\nExample in Private mode:\n\nconst params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);const identifier = params.get(\"identifier\");const contact = params.get(\"contact\");// or for private modewindow.IngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi.renderPrivateMode({  containerId: \"delivery-tracking-widget\",  siteId: \"<YOUR_SITE_ID_FROM_IMP>\",  locale: \"<LOCALE>\",  identifier,  contact,});\n\nCopy\nListening to events emitted by Tracking Widget\nCurrently we provide a mode_change event when the user switches from search mode to private mode and vice versa. You can use following snippet to listen to mode_change:\n\nwindow.IngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi.on(\"mode_changed\", containerId, (event) => {  console.log(`Mode changed for ${containerId} with event:`, event);});\n\nCopy\nThe on function takes 3 arguments:\n\nevent_type - currently only mode_change is supported\ncontainerId - HTML id of Tracking Widget container (the same you use to embed Tracking Widget)\nevent handler - function with one argument of {to: 'search|private'} object that indicates to what Tracking Widget mode user switched\n\nIntegration Example\nTracking Widget Integration Example\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nEmbedding Delivery Tracking Widget\n\nIngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi\n\nPassing arguments to IngridDeliveryTrackingWidgetApi\n\nListening to events emitted by Tracking Widget\n\nIntegration Example\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":7784,"endCharIdx":11751,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZUeHOguDhriv5FtCTyp9JjWDm2N0KbiNJx8lMyms9BM="},"18ec658d-79ad-41ab-b005-ea81c6fccb89":{"id_":"18ec658d-79ad-41ab-b005-ea81c6fccb89","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/reference/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bc2069e7-eeae-4c31-b891-b105125cd613","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/reference/"},"hash":"C6S+Mfi/gcb+WfDwBHseJFM0b89XSgEqXBpXE1Cr8Ls="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4d515036-a85e-4269-8a1f-bc41eaf98cab","metadata":{},"hash":"3LTN1cdJyqvVcLkbGzEYmaBddXGTtLxDbKmuKWmUQfU="}},"text":"Reference | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

To make this possible, Ingrid System needs to receive tracking numbers for each parcel. Note that in the context of Ingrid Delivery Tracking, each tracking number represents a single package.\nData flow varies depending on whether you book deliveries through Ingrid Transport Administration or through a different system.\nDeliveries booked with Ingrid Transport Administration\nWhen Ingrid Transport Automation is used to create and book shipments, the generated tracking numbers are automatically recognised by Ingrid Delivery Tracking. All tracking numbers representing individual parcels are matched with the proper Order out of the box when a Transport Order ID (order identifier) is used in the createShipment or createAndBook request.\nThere are two ways to achieve multiparcel Delivery Tracking with Ingrid Booked shipments:\n\nBooking singular shipments, one per parcel.\nBooking one shipment, containing multiple parcels.\n\nBoth methods are interpreted in the same manner by Delivery Tracking Widget.\nData priority\nInformation on a shipment level can be different from the information present on an order level. In such a case, Ingrid Delivery Tracking will prioritise data introduced on the shipment level and present that data to the End Customer on the Tracking Widget and Tracking Page, overriding order level information.\n\nDeliveries booked with external systems\nIf you are using an external system to book orders, you can still track them using the Ingrid Tracking Widget. To this end you need to post tracking numbers to the Ingrid System using the RegisterTrackingNumber endpoint.\nTo properly register a tracking number you received from your external booking system, you need to specify the order number (external_id or tos_id) along with the carrier product that was used for booking in a POST request made to v1/events_gateway/events.registerTrackingNumber.\nRequest #1 Request #2 Request #3\n\n\nPOST v1/events_gateway/events.registerTrackingNumber HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer <BASE64-ENCODED-API-TOKEN>{  \"tracking_number\": \"BST000185540\",  \"external_id\": \"592978\",  \"carrier_product_ref\": \"postnord-mypack-collect\",  \"direction_type\": \"OUTBOUND\"}\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nPOST v1/events_gateway/events.registerTrackingNumber HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer <BASE64-ENCODED-API-TOKEN>{  \"tracking_number\": \"BST000185540\",  \"tos_id\": \"01G51NDWW1NCPNV2MV5WMB0H6A\",  \"carrier_product_ref\": \"postnord-mypack-collect\",  \"direction_type\": \"OUTBOUND\"}\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nPOST v1/events_gateway/events.registerTrackingNumber HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer <BASE64-ENCODED-API-TOKEN>{  \"tracking_number\": \"BST000185540\",  \"external_id\": \"592978\",  \"carrier_product_ref\": \"postnord-mypack-collect\",  \"direction_type\": \"RETURN\"}\n\nCopy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4990,"endCharIdx":9641,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fvZIVKG9GSchZgVs5XhD1fs7lNO1XP48OCP7+xYYMHw="},"dba166ba-c5df-41f9-9c4b-6725cc779a15":{"id_":"dba166ba-c5df-41f9-9c4b-6725cc779a15","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/providing_data/parcels_and_tracking_numbers/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"7c1fc603-bc47-4c96-967d-d8c59022a288","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/providing_data/parcels_and_tracking_numbers/"},"hash":"H1n9Jth7pYh6aqOU3IRE0XWQCKaMTBR7u0DhwDsFRDQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f9c190db-a983-443e-b7bb-ee6e8f68d776","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/providing_data/parcels_and_tracking_numbers/"},"hash":"hDpbogWLWixy4GOMgv2KmXulsJKZQ69apzp0KquLBic="}},"text":"POST v1/events_gateway/events.registerTrackingNumber HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer <BASE64-ENCODED-API-TOKEN>{  \"tracking_number\": \"BST000185540\",  \"tos_id\": \"01G51NDWW1NCPNV2MV5WMB0H6A\",  \"carrier_product_ref\": \"postnord-mypack-collect\",  \"direction_type\": \"OUTBOUND\"}\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nPOST v1/events_gateway/events.registerTrackingNumber HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer <BASE64-ENCODED-API-TOKEN>{  \"tracking_number\": \"BST000185540\",  \"external_id\": \"592978\",  \"carrier_product_ref\": \"postnord-mypack-collect\",  \"direction_type\": \"RETURN\"}\n\nCopy\n\n\nOrder identification\nThe external_id or tos_id you provide in the RegisterTrackingNumber request must exactly match the one used in either Ingrid Delivery Checkout or Ingrid Transport Automation. This correspondence allows us to accurately link tracking numbers to orders and provide a seamless Tracking Experience for End Customers. Any discrepancies will result in incomplete information and potentially hinder Consumers' ability to track their parcels effectively.\n\nExternally booked multiparcel orders\nTo track multiparcel orders booked externally, register each tracking number individually using the same order identifier (external_id or tos_id) in each request. This automatically connects them to the same order for a smooth Tracking Experience.\n\nSpecifying a carrier product used for booking can be tricky, since each party or system usually operates based on self-made identifiers. That is why Ingrid has created a mechanism that makes the integration easier by allowing any integrator to reuse its own internal naming while being precise about the carrier product - see carrier product mapping.\ndirection_type is an optional field that holds information about the initial package direction. This information helps us show you the most accurate list in IMP and provide the best Tracking Experience for Customers. Direction type is especially important when you are registering not only outbound parcels but also returns - e.g., when you are booking a return shipment and want to register it with our system.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nDeliveries booked with Ingrid Transport Administration\n\nDeliveries booked with external systems\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":8956,"endCharIdx":11362,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"11s78VCiNOtdeM5XsFW299SSWT3jDGzXqGn45J4Pob8="},"177c17cf-acc9-4e85-b629-9fcd2ad8f128":{"id_":"177c17cf-acc9-4e85-b629-9fcd2ad8f128","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/faq/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"329d81c0-baa3-427b-b9f0-34e5f427cb6e","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/faq/"},"hash":"2motXTtmc3vk4AtgDlf0PvN3+FcASqSkUuho9ghz67c="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"576d31c2-3121-4da4-8b8a-4761f21a5a0a","metadata":{},"hash":"K4ZOeBVNUUNoI1MV6RJJ8F27E57nAKnl729h6qmP26o="}},"text":"Overview | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

This integrated solution empowers Customers with real-time delivery updates, ensuring they stay informed at every step of their order journey. The Ingrid Hosted Solution is built around two key components:\nTracking Portal: A centralised hub for End Customers to effortlessly search for and track their orders.\nTracking Page: A dedicated page where Customers can access detailed information about their parcels - including delivery status, ETA, and any relevant updates - similar to the Tracking Widget. Following a successful search, Tracking Portal redirects Customers to Tracking Page.\nUsing Tracking Portal\nTo direct End Customers to the Ingrid Tracking Portal, simply provide them with the following link:\n\nhttps://tracking.ingrid.com/\n\nCopy\nTo pre-populate the search field on the Tracking Portal with specific contact information and parcel identifier, include two query parameters (prefillContact and prefillIdentifier) in the URL:\n\nhttps://tracking.ingrid.com/?prefillContact=<EMAIL>&prefillIdentifier=<ORDER/TRACKING NUMBER>\n\nCopy\nURL Encoding\nEnsure that the <EMAIL> and <ORDER/TRACKING NUMBER> values in the query parameters are properly URL-encoded to avoid any issues with special characters. For example, an email like user@example.com should be encoded as user%40example.com.\n\nThe URL to Tracking Portal can be localized by adding a locale after .ingrid.com part:\n\nhttps://tracking.ingrid.com/<LOCALE>/\n\nCopy\n\nUsing Tracking Page\nThe Ingrid Tracking Page offers two ways for customers to access their delivery information.\n\nPublic View:\n\n\nEasier to integrate with.\nRequires End Customers to enter an email in the Tracking Widget to access full tracking data.\nHides sensitive information like home delivery address to ensure privacy.\n\n\nPrivate View:","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4984,"endCharIdx":8491,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0TL6655xh+raV1yA+mlp1r96DWBludpgoaZ9zyUnlEQ="},"4519b81f-15c6-4ce9-8ff2-263ab6433528":{"id_":"4519b81f-15c6-4ce9-8ff2-263ab6433528","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/ingrid_hosted_page_and_portal/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5b40d6d2-e92b-47f6-884c-0968badb1044","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/ingrid_hosted_page_and_portal/"},"hash":"o/AVcc5sXrpxke3czs5azBxheI2xsPn/hNlPXftqLRI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"de8fd63a-40c8-4009-96e1-11d182fb7d4a","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/integration/ingrid_hosted_page_and_portal/"},"hash":"94uPhNAP+ujSqNN8VBpx0rcs8+HP9My0RB8l/NJSt8s="}},"text":"Easier to integrate with.\nRequires End Customers to enter an email in the Tracking Widget to access full tracking data.\nHides sensitive information like home delivery address to ensure privacy.\n\n\nPrivate View:\n\n\nRequires integration with Ingrid's Delivery Tracking API.\nOffers seamless access for End Customers to their tracking information, requiring no additional action from them.\n\nPublic View is ideal when you prioritise faster integration and less development effort, with a downside of requiring an extra step from the End Customers.\nPrivate View is ideal when you are seeking a truly frictionless experience for customers, prioritizing their convenience and data privacy.\nPublic View\nA link to the public view can be constructed simply by taking Ingrid Transport Order ID (TOS ID) and adding /order/<TRANSPORT_ORDER_ID> to the base Tracking Portal URL:\n\nhttps://tracking.ingrid.com/order/<TRANSPORT_ORDER_ID>\n\nCopy\nA public URL can be localized by adding locale after .ingrid.com part:\n\nhttps://tracking.ingrid.com/<LOCALE>/order/<TRANSPORT_ORDER_ID>\n\nCopy\nPrivate View\nA direct link to private Tracking Page view can be obtained using GenerateTrackingPageLink endpoint:\n\nPOST v1/delivery_tracking/generate_tracking_page_linkHost: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer <BASE64-ENCODED-API-TOKEN>{    \"locale\": \"en-US\",    \"order_id\": \"592978\",    \"site_id\": \"11756e4a98c64fa9a9c5d627fd88a236\"}\n\nCopy\n\norder_id can be populated with either external_id or TOS_ID.\nlocale adjusts the language of Tracking Page.

feeling\nof the API and the data flows.SIW is responsible for maintaining life cycle of a session that has all the\ndata needed by the shipping selector widget.When a user visits checkout\npage, makes any changes to cart contents, selects shipping options and\ncompletes a purchase, all the relevant data are stored in the session.Every session contains result field which provides information about currently selected delivery option.It contains all important information like:\n\npricing,\ncategory,\nshipping method,\nexternal_method_id,\ndetails of pickup point if applicable.Result field should be used in integration to get final result of session.The example result looks as follows:\n\n{  \"session\": {    \"result\": {      \"shipping\": {        \"shipping_method\": \"pnl-mpc\",        \"delivery_type\": \"pickup\",        \"carrier\": \"PostNord\",        \"product\": \"MyPack Collect\",        \"location\": {          \"external_id\": \"586287\",          \"name\": \"Direkten

simply points us to which area package should be delivered, but it doesn't need to be customer real address.\nThe customer address must be provided by the merchant.\nFor example, if you want to have a package delivered close to your work, you can fill search address with your office address.\nThe customer is a customer home address. It allows performing fraud detection if someone is ordering an expensive item and customer and search addresses are distant to each other.\nThe merchant could compare both addresses and verify if the order is valid by contacting the customer before shipping goods.\n\nComplete Session\nThe session.complete method is used to mark a session as complete. At this\npoint, if the customer haven't made a choice we'll generate one for the\ncustomer based on the information in the Customer property provided in the request.\n::: tip\nSearch address and customer address are two different entities, that serve separate purposes during session lifetime.\nSearch address is provided by the customer and the customer address is always provided by merchant.\nSearch address is used to generate the shipping options that will be presented to the customer. Customer address is the address where the parcel will be sent and should be provided sometime during session lifetime (at the latest during session.complete).\nShipping options may be regenerated under some conditions when the customer address is provided and it differs from the search address.\n:::\nThe sequence diagram below describes the flow between the Customer, Merchant,\nShipping Selector and SIW API when completing a session when the customer checkout.\nSIW APIMerchantCustomerSIW APIMerchantCustomerCompletes the orderCall /session.completeReturn completed session stateRedirects to confirmation page\n\nCustomer completes the transaction\nMerchant completes the session using session.complete method\nSIW API returns session in a completed state. The SelectedShippingOption and tos_id are also returned.\nMerchant redirects the customer to the confirmation page\n\n\nOn session complete call a tos_id will be returned. This id is important if you need to re-open a session as a\ncompleted session is \"frozen\" and cannot be modified. You can use tos_id to clone a completed session.\n\nExample Calls\nRequest Response\n\nRequest\n\nPOST /v1/siw/session.complete HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type:

It covers only details relevant to the users of this feature.\nStep 1: session.create or session.get\nCreate one session per every widget using snippet_configuration top-level field of session.create payload:\n\n  \"snippet_configuration\": {    \"container_id\": \"string\",    \"object_id\": \"string\"  }\n\nCopy\ncontainer_id - HTML element ID assigned to widget's container element. Default value is shipwallet-container . It can be used to add CSS to widget's container.\nobject_id - ID of the widget instance, used to differentiate between widgets simultaneously loaded in the user's browser. If widget's API (i.e. suspend and resume methods) are used, object_id is used to specify target widget. Default value is _sw.\nDuplicate ids\nMake sure to choose unique container_id for each widget, it is required for widgets to work properly. If you are using shipwallet-container id on any element on your page, then pass custom container_id in snippet configuration to prevent id collision.\n\nRequest\n\nRequest\n\nPOST /v1/siw/session.create HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer base64-encoded-api-token{  \"purchase_country\": \"SE\",  \"purchase_currency\": \"SEK\",  \"locales\": [    \"sv-SE\"  ],  \"search_address\": {    \"postal_code\": \"11239\",    \"country\": \"SE\"  },  \"cart\": {    \"total_value\": 129900,    \"currency\": \"SEK\",    \"items\": [      {        \"sku\": \"SKU12345\",        \"name\": \"Saucony Shadow 6000\",        \"quantity\": 1,        \"attributes\": [          \"shoes\",          \"indigo\",          \"class_one\"        ]      }    ]  },  \"snippet_configuration\": {    \"container_id\": \"widget-container-1\",    \"object_id\": \"widget_1\",  }}\n\nCopy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4978,"endCharIdx":8356,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TAfZJKVjx9pJZt44qony+XfXhR8PrJs+n/+3+mp4bMA="},"869281c7-44f8-469c-aeda-809f068af40e":{"id_":"869281c7-44f8-469c-aeda-809f068af40e","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/multiple_widgets"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"15f4a572-579c-4f4e-8aa1-afb1539a8c2a","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/multiple_widgets"},"hash":"03aCUSixLoeIK1jAaHxHSife/Sx21BJlfgHswfxle68="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"83115070-9e59-4443-a197-97b3a69b70fc","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/multiple_widgets"},"hash":"eL/ZndYMPpETJmJPN2BJI0ah1u7ruLsXw/N5kq9IQ5w="}},"text":"Uniqueness of object_id and container_id\nobject_id does not have to be globally unique. object_id must only be unique in browser context of a given user. Example: user A goes to checkout with two orders from different vendors in his cart, so they get to see two widgets, one is widget_1, the other is widget_2 . The second one can have any object_id other than widget_1 . User B (different machine and browser context) goes to checkout and also has two widgets, widget_1 and widget_2.\ncontainer_id is an HTML element ID and therefore there cannot be two same IDs in one HTML page, otherwise it's not valid HTML.\nsession.get\nsession.get does not accept snippet_configuration, instead session remembers the configuration it has been created with and session.get will return html_snippet with previous object_id and container_id.\nHowever, it is not straightforward to extract container_id and object_id from html_snippet. Instead, snippet_configuration should be saved and kept track of, just like session_id. For example, if session_id is kept in cart object, then snippet_configuration can also be kept there.\nStep 2: embed html_snippets to render multiple widgets\nRendering one or more widgets works the same way. Embed html_snippets returned from session.create or session.get in your checkout page.\nThe snippet_configuration is reflected in the html_snippet:\n\n<div id=\"{% container_id %}\">  <script>    (function(window, objectId, containerId, document) {      ...    })(window, {% object_id %}, {% container_id %}, document);  </script></div>\n\nCopy\nStep 3: (optional) suspend/resume\nEach widget instance gets its own global variable in the browser's context named after its object_id . For object_id == \"widget_1\" , the variable will be named widget_1 and thus will be accessible as window.widget_1 or window[\"widget_1\"] . So call to suspend would look like this:\n\nwindow[\"widget_1\"]((api) => api.suspend());\n\nCopy\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nRequest\n\nUniqueness of object_id and container_id\n\nsession.get\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":8359,"endCharIdx":10444,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6qqDb7JlK7nG+5sMKOqa1fgPMPODVGEo8rQtnwUMUvg="},"b3e38325-3b7f-44cd-b93c-995bba984f80":{"id_":"b3e38325-3b7f-44cd-b93c-995bba984f80","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/address_form"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"2d84813e-1907-475c-8f87-08e7378437de","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/address_form"},"hash":"fF5JCtzhIaU6vHe3NNlOMVd6Ln8erxncTkljLDQ+cV4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"673216de-4baf-4543-b7e7-ac982c5d2778","metadata":{},"hash":"lNwg4HDShxdgdiDhro9VZlimhCqrIHYN2K9Cw864om8="}},"text":"Address form | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

Customer input validation takes the regional address formats into the account.\n\nEnabling the address form\nAddress form is disabled by default in the Delivery Checkout API configuration. You can enable the address form by requesting it from Ingrid Support here.\nAddress form support\nIntegration with Delivery Checkout API is needed in order to use the address form solution. If you are planning to upgrade from the SIW API, please see the upgrade checklist.\n\nLayout and validation rules\nWe provide you with the option to customize the layout of the address form, akin to arranging a puzzle. You have the flexibility to select fields, adjust their width, and establish validation rules for precise and accurate data input.\nAdditionally, you can create presets for each country, allowing for distinct layouts and validation criteria. Should you need any assistance or wish to discuss customization, our Ingrid Support team is readily available to assist you.\nWe support form fields as follows:\n\nNAME\nFIRST_NAME\nLAST_NAME\nADDRESS_LINE\nSTREET\nSTREET_NUMBER\nAPARTMENT_NUMBER\nPOSTAL_CODE\nCITY\nREGION\nPHONE_NUMBER\nEMAIL\nVAT\nCOMPANY_NAME\nCARE_OF\nFLOOR\nNATIONAL_IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4974,"endCharIdx":7952,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"M7g3d6hfMUqDKGh8ULnqVtx4/Sz8NKOUcu/HJ5UUabA="},"65115f96-0704-4d22-a306-70775d55c036":{"id_":"65115f96-0704-4d22-a306-70775d55c036","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/address_form"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"2d84813e-1907-475c-8f87-08e7378437de","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/address_form"},"hash":"fF5JCtzhIaU6vHe3NNlOMVd6Ln8erxncTkljLDQ+cV4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"673216de-4baf-4543-b7e7-ac982c5d2778","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/address_form"},"hash":"lNwg4HDShxdgdiDhro9VZlimhCqrIHYN2K9Cw864om8="}},"text":"Regional trends\nIngrid address form is following the regional trends. Set of field inputs and required fields are dependent based on the country of the customer. Inline addresses visualised in the address book are taking the regional trends into account as well.\nIn the picture below you can see the behaviour of the autocomplete solution that is shipped along the address form. Its output is based on the country of the customer too and aids the process of entering the address to a great extent.\n\nValidating the inputs\nAll inputs of the address form are validated. This helps to decrease the number of parcels, which need the correction of the address in the warehouse.\n\nDeliveries are our bread and butter at Ingrid. We observed that certain countries have a lot of regional trends in the way the addresses are provided by customers, such as ordering of address parts and using region-specific abbreviations. Using address form can reduce warehouse unexpected additional operational costs.\n\nWe understand that business needs can sometimes demand unique rules. That's why we offer customizable validation rules, allowing you the flexibility to configure them according to your preferences.\nRequired\nYou can define which inputs are required to proceed with the checkout process. Additionally, you have the option to create input groups, specifying that only one (or more) of them is necessary. Once this condition is met, the remaining inputs in that group will be marked as optional.\nFor instance, consider the address form where the First Name, Last Name, and Email fields are grouped as required inputs, with only one of them needed to fulfill the condition.\n\nLength\nYou have the flexibility to establish length validation for an individual input or a set of inputs. This allows you to define both minimum and maximum character limits for a combined group of inputs. Consequently, within that group, the total character count is restricted to the specified limits.\nFor example, the address form can be configured to ensure that the combined character count of First Name and Last Name inputs does not exceed 10 characters.\n\nAutocomplete validation\nWe continually strive to validate the information provided to minimize the risk of incorrect shipments. Therefore, our autocomplete solution incorporates a fallback scenario. In instances where only a street name is provided without a number, the input will be divided into two separate fields: Street and Street number.\nThe following scenario illustrates how our autocomplete feature will respond if you attempt to proceed with the checkout without providing a street number or without utilizing our autocomplete suggestions from the list.\n\nUpon clicking Continue, we will validate the address you provided. If we are unable to locate it or observe that an address line isn't filled properly , we will separate the Street and Number field and notify customer about the missing or wrong data.\n\nBilling address\nThe address form provides options to enable or disable various features that can contribute to achieving distinct delivery goals.\nCertain situations may necessitate providing distinct address details for billing purposes. In our address form, you can easily enable the visibility and requirement of a billing address in your checkout process.\nBilling address layout\nIn certain cases, the billing address may differ from the delivery address. We offer you the flexibility to configure the billing address separately, allowing you to determine its appearance and required information. As illustrated below, the billing address can significantly vary from the delivery address in the examples above.\n\nBilling address validation rules\nThis also extends to billing address validation rules, allowing you to set them individually for both billing and delivery addresses.\n\nReadonly fields when prefilled\nWe offer support for making input fields readonly when recipient data is sourced from an external system. In such cases, these frozen fields remain unchangeable during the initial visit.\n\nAddress book\nCustomer addresses are persisted for future use in an address book. Address book takes the burden of providing and switching between address off the customer.\nComplying to GDPR\nWe are complying to GDPR regulations when it comes to handling data. All data persisted in the Ingrid platform can be removed on customer's request. In order to remove customer data, please request it via contacting Ingrid Support here.\n\nHide address book\nThe Address Book is a valuable tool designed to conveniently store multiple addresses in one place for future use. However, we understand that there are instances when it may not be needed. That's why we offer you the option to disable the Address Book.\nWhen this feature is disabled, new addresses will continue to be added in the background, ensuring that your Address Book remains up-to-date. So, even if you choose to temporarily hide it, when you decide to re-enable the Address Book, you'll find that it contains all the addresses you've added during that time. While the Address Book is disabled, users will have the ability to add and edit a single delivery address.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nAddress form\n\nEnabling the address form\n\nLayout and validation rules\n\nRegional trends\n\nValidating the inputs\n\nBilling address\n\nReadonly fields when prefilled\n\nAddress book\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":7955,"endCharIdx":13399,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Vc/TfvmsfkXQEinzF3MVWv2di4pkFknWRSRrITecKcQ="},"e6fff0bf-ec40-4294-8717-64e8af1971ab":{"id_":"e6fff0bf-ec40-4294-8717-64e8af1971ab","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/prerequisits/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"21118a94-530f-437b-834b-777006d58a20","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/prerequisits/"},"hash":"5oFOuacsOzaWl29vtn0tlEsIJ/OlrVR9Z+fxDxawa1s="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a15d0384-1049-48d1-b55f-b3c62c04be9a","metadata":{},"hash":"ZAAtPq/Kugee9NjGEqQHs0OB0Slq+eBaOv4gliLKnEU="}},"text":"404 | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

Shipping selector embedded on your checkout page and all frontend-related integration parts remain the same.\nIntegration with Delivery Checkout API requires minor changes for handling the response bodies structure. The response payload resembles the payload from SIW API. Some new fields were introduced though and naming of top-level result field was changed to delivery_groups.\nBenefits of upgrade\nYou should upgrade to new Delivery Checkout API in order to benefit from new features, such as address form, split shipments handling or marketplaces handling.\nUpgrade checklist\nThe following checklist aims to simplify the process of upgrade to our new Delivery Checkout API.\n\nGet familiar with the new API (you will quickly notice that it is not different from the Swagger of SIW API).\nDecide whether you want to handle split shipments, if so - decide the split condition that should be applied to cart items.\nContact Ingrid Support Team here. We will guide you through the process of setting up the split condition logic.\nHandle delivery_groups field from the response payloads in your integration - if you are using single cart setting, your delivery_groups field will contain only one delivery group (a single delivery group is similar to result from SIW API).\nDecide when you want to fetch sessions with fresh shipping options and when session states with possibly stale shipping options (by expiration time slots) are acceptable. Depending on the decision, use session.pull or session.get respectively. To learn more about differences between those two endpoints, consult the session.pull endpoint documentation.\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nBenefits of upgrade\n\nUpgrade checklist\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4988,"endCharIdx":8555,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"p1yjuC1Yxs3fixWCmGO7B4F8yVwKmRNGjqswtQNiABM="},"2b7e61ac-1690-44e5-ab60-72749d83a1ff":{"id_":"2b7e61ac-1690-44e5-ab60-72749d83a1ff","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/split_shipment"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"c59a80c4-2f52-449f-8bc1-b51f78be4cec","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/split_shipment"},"hash":"UJjt29KDU9pAqTCg2ldMi7Yt4YBKAqzUqmM7nIZCgn4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d8e2b55d-1c27-42c7-a40c-8de3b9f51231","metadata":{},"hash":"ZAAtPq/Kugee9NjGEqQHs0OB0Slq+eBaOv4gliLKnEU="}},"text":"404 | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

They link specific tracking numbers to the corresponding carrier services, allowing the Ingrid System to retrieve carrier tracking events.\nSetup for Carrier Product Mappings varies depending on booking source (Ingrid Booked or Externally Booked Carrier Products). Mappings configuration can be accessed in IMP under Delivery Tracking Section > Product mappings.\nAfter Carrier Product Mappings are in place and tracking configuration is set up by the Ingrid Onboarding Team, Ingrid Delivery Tracking will start to retrieve Tracking Events from carriers.\nIngrid Booked Products\nMapping for products booked with Ingrid Transport Administration will automatically appear under Ingrid Booked Products section. If something for your booking setup is missing from that section, please reach out to Ingrid Customer Support.\n\nExternally Booked Products\nCarrier Product Mappings for externally booked product require manual configuration.\ncarrier_product_ref is a unique reference that connects carrier products from your system to Ingrid. It helps to understand which carrier service was used to book a delivery. carrier_product_ref can be any string value, but do keep it consistent for all tracking numbers using the same product. Don't forget to add new products to Ingrid by mapping them first, so that they can be tracked properly.\n\n\nUsage\ncarrier_product_ref are later used in CreateTrackingOrder and RegisterTrackingNumbers requests.\n\nMapping suggestions\nIf CreateTrackingOrder or RegisterTrackingNumber requests were made with an unmapped carrier_product_ref, a mapping suggestion for those will appear on top on the Product mappings page. You will also receive a notification about unmapped references after logging into IMP.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4986,"endCharIdx":8384,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qdCz7Hkr7S3/dopVTV7wAKQx+hwjVOBNJW3tDEYAGqA="},"86d6e521-f01d-44e5-9c6f-c83509dbae36":{"id_":"86d6e521-f01d-44e5-9c6f-c83509dbae36","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/providing_data/carrier_product_mappings/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9f3b896c-8893-4c0e-9bbf-a4428a6976ef","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/providing_data/carrier_product_mappings/"},"hash":"GGKxHZ/hhTWaX+MyQhGz41VEo7sQXgzb6fqHNU1UnPI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e1745abe-b167-4094-990c-cff3ab5e7d88","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/providing_data/carrier_product_mappings/"},"hash":"YEO/t0GzR1/EAQT12DBmIvtTdZkNL5s+bXgb4Kzg1gY="}},"text":"Usage\ncarrier_product_ref are later used in CreateTrackingOrder and RegisterTrackingNumbers requests.\n\nMapping suggestions\nIf CreateTrackingOrder or RegisterTrackingNumber requests were made with an unmapped carrier_product_ref, a mapping suggestion for those will appear on top on the Product mappings page. You will also receive a notification about unmapped references after logging into IMP.\n\n\nThere are two types of suggestions:\n\nGeneral ones, highlighting the reference only\nShowing the exact carrier product used - those will work only if the carrier_product_ref used matches exactly against a carrier_product_id in Ingrid System.\n\nAfter a suggestion is mapped, all tracking numbers with such carrier_product_ref will be updated with the carrier product assigned to that mapping.\nUnmapped suggestions\nUnmapped suggestions will expire after 5 days, as long as there are no new requests made with them. Each carrier_product_ref actively used for tracking numbers registration must be mapped; otherwise you will be stuck with an unmapped product suggestion and Ingrid will be unable to track those parcels.\n\nFallback to carrier tracking links\nIf tracking integration for selected product is not available, but URLs to Carrier's tracking are (referred to as tracking links), a fallback redirecting Customers from Ingrid Delivery Tracking to Carrier's tracking website can be enabled. To this end, select the Always show tracking links option.\nApart from the default carrier tracking links available, you can configure custom URLs. Those are not linked to any particular carrier product and serve as a fallback solution for products not yet integrated with Ingrid. Every custom URL must contain a <TRACKING_NUMBER> placeholder. It will be filled with a parcel's tracking number by Ingrid.\nTracking links fallback can de applied to both Ingrid Booked and externally booked carrier products.\n\nTracking Links impact on the Ingrid Delivery Tracking Experience\nBear in mind that tracking links are meant to be a fallback for carrier products without a tracking integration with Ingrid in place yet. As all URLs require a placeholder for tracking_number, a redirection button will appear only after a tracking number is registered or a shipment gets booked. Until then, Harmonised Progress steps will be shown. Showing the redirection button results in Alerts and ETA tracking features being disabled.\n\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nIngrid Booked Products\n\nExternally Booked Products\n\nMapping suggestions\n\nFallback to carrier tracking links\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":7989,"endCharIdx":10601,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5Xxg8uo+BtNBcR2BLFOuxcpw8z6Jufmo/OIRqwOX7G0="},"4605b37e-c76c-4984-8ea1-7d9493bb3b7c":{"id_":"4605b37e-c76c-4984-8ea1-7d9493bb3b7c","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/tracking_features/harmonised_progress/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"cd746aa7-0387-4606-84fe-c0b69565db8c","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/tracking_features/harmonised_progress/"},"hash":"IF35upxvo9B1akTDynlB9hO8ltgWfL1cyOA/hI/KR1M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0d05b3a1-f6e9-4fc9-95c8-b1d65fc3bb57","metadata":{},"hash":"c4Q3YUyjVDDcOgXlub5xH7ZZmBzJXspRtArEW6NaZfk="}},"text":"Harmonised Progress | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

It is separate from the shipping method, because the merchant can customise the details of the carrier product by setting e.g. price/price rules and when to offer the carrier product.\nNote\nTo use a carrier product, it has to be applied to Ingrid configuration in the Ingrid Merchant Platform for the given site.\n\nShipping method\nIt is the Ingrid internal representation of a delivery method that can be used in an Ingrid context. Shipping methods represents carrier products. Shipping methods are carrier product specific. A Shipping method can be an express home delivery or a pickup point delivery.\nNote\nUser of Ingrid Merchant Platform assigns carrier products while they are operated as Shipping methods in Ingrid.\n\nShipping category\nAlso known as delivery category. The entity that defines a delivery offering that will be selectable in the Delivery Checkout for the consumer. Shipping categories contains carrier products (represented as shipping methods). Merchant can customise the delivery categories by controlling what the Delivery category offerings is in terms of e.g. base Delivery Time, Delivery Time format (weekday vs. date) etc.\nShipping option\nA concrete delivery choice selected by the customer. For example, we have a shipping category to a pickup point, that presents the user a list of 20 pickup points to choose from. A single choice is a shipping option, even though they all belong to the same shipping category.\nOrder\nIt is a representation of a completed session. Order holds all the necessary information about the result of user interaction with the Delivery Checkout needed to fulfill the delivery, such as cart information, delivery address, customer details and others.\nNote\nIngrid order is intended to be related with an order in the merchant's e-commerce system. The linking can be done by using external_id field.\n\nShipment\nIt is an order we began fulfilling. Shipment consists of data required by the carrier to make a delivery i.e. addresses, parcel details and delivery times. It can be created based on data held in order alone, but it can also be customized to represent complex scenarios (return deliveries, duty declarations, consolidated deliveries).\nParcel\nIt represents a physical box with a label that is identified by a tracking number and can be tracked using Ingrid Tracking solution. A single shipment can consist of one or multiple parcels needed to fulfil the delivery of goods to the consumer.\nIngrid Merchant Platform (IMP)\nIt is the administration portal for Ingrid clients. It can be used to manage orders, configure widgets, track shipments and more.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nMerchant\n\nSite\n\nCarrier\n\nConfiguration\n\nSession\n\nCarrier product\n\nShipping method\n\nShipping category\n\nShipping option\n\nOrder\n\nShipment\n\nParcel\n\nIngrid Merchant Platform (IMP)\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":5559,"endCharIdx":10765,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"payFXwsJyIJJb1U8aL4OBWGWf3zQYDFgSOQFVipfUhE="},"198155d8-c8a4-4c0b-be9f-d355b4be4b54":{"id_":"198155d8-c8a4-4c0b-be9f-d355b4be4b54","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/addresses/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f438d1d9-f59c-4b2c-a7a9-8c3bde20556e","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/features/addresses/"},"hash":"7bpAHClL/uurjGX79BgkY5BvsSlbyAL7en0WXlKU5uM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7efbe2b4-149b-41b5-9644-10612fe73041","metadata":{},"hash":"CyXOHbWdB9yRuZeutDDDMNRs9sZj8OkHj1zMPHgENAE="}},"text":"Address types overview | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

how to integrate with prebooking,\nsee how webhooks are leveraged for prebooking mechanism,\ngain knowledge about the prebooking message format.Requirements\nIn order to use the prebooking callbacks to your API, it needs to meet the following requirements:\n\nconsume the message format (can be configured with field exclusion, more information in message format subsection),\nconsume JSON,\nsupport authorization with bearer token,\ncommunicate over HTTPS.The URL of the endpoint to which the prebooking callbacks will be made has to be added to prebooking configuration.Webhooks\nPrebooking mechanism is implemented with webhooks.Webhook is fired every time a customer converts (finalizes the order) to an endpoint provided in the prebooking configuration.Each webhook contains a unique identifier and set of fields related to the finalized order.More about the fields in the message payload can be found in the message format subsection and Reference section.Rate limiting\nPrebooking webhooks are rate limited.Rate limits are set per month and are lifted at the beginning of each month.To learn more about rate limits, contact us here.We provide both paid tier and free tier of this service with generous number of prebooking webhooks to be used per month.🎁\n\nMessage format\nPrebooking webhook messages are sent in the following format as JSON.To learn more about the exact fields and types, please consult the Reference section.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"e9D/ZB16527x0e5z6OPo9XDIjd0PjN+MIRRiLzkRhhE="},"5549970b-bdf8-470a-b36b-70217cfae9f5":{"id_":"5549970b-bdf8-470a-b36b-70217cfae9f5","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/integration"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"29055501-d47e-4af2-8b7b-e8d3746d30a5","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/integration"},"hash":"FHaQxVJ509L5h/9TYA7uUnXbvWaERDVduc6QQrUh8eQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a327c376-bd67-4bbd-8e02-2d3a32dfe89d","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/integration"},"hash":"v2kyQun7DFOHBs5Ii6RdmJZd1mm23Pnzo/0hGNHgtH0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"76fe9ae2-d3cd-493a-bf77-91b57a50c526","metadata":{},"hash":"gxSr1YWXNJuFXPaqcIP2jn6KtatzWyUMokzmpB9jZ5E="}},"text":"The

how to integrate with prebooking,\nsee how webhooks are leveraged for prebooking mechanism,\ngain knowledge about the prebooking message format.Requirements\nIn order to use the prebooking callbacks to your API, it needs to meet the following requirements:\n\nconsume the message format (can be configured with field exclusion, more information in message format subsection),\nconsume JSON,\nsupport authorization with bearer token,\ncommunicate over HTTPS.The URL of the endpoint to which the prebooking callbacks will be made has to be added to prebooking configuration.Webhooks\nPrebooking mechanism is implemented with webhooks.Webhook is fired every time a customer converts (finalizes the order) to an endpoint provided in the prebooking configuration.Each webhook contains a unique identifier and set of fields related to the finalized order.More about the fields in the message payload can be found in the message format subsection and Reference section.Rate limiting\nPrebooking webhooks are rate limited.Rate limits are set per month and are lifted at the beginning of each month.To learn more about rate limits, contact us here.We provide both paid tier and free tier of this service with generous number of prebooking webhooks to be used per month.🎁\n\nMessage format\nPrebooking webhook messages are sent in the following format as JSON.To learn more about the exact fields and types, please consult the Reference section.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+q/d0NFxQGwL1KC4GZXM9GcwHIxH41T2ArszIqGbyZU="},"46f21a19-098a-40a8-9f28-4fee1cf0e947":{"id_":"46f21a19-098a-40a8-9f28-4fee1cf0e947","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bd9b0c41-296f-47e8-a8ec-2798df685bb5","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/integration/"},"hash":"K7oTUyOMeGU5UDviIYhj/C895MsasO4kNpHdbI8KWLs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ce419454-459d-4754-b434-7c1f8761fa47","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/integration/"},"hash":"v2kyQun7DFOHBs5Ii6RdmJZd1mm23Pnzo/0hGNHgtH0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"01f66430-53ad-47b9-8877-c9a41cfc0d1c","metadata":{},"hash":"gxSr1YWXNJuFXPaqcIP2jn6KtatzWyUMokzmpB9jZ5E="}},"text":"The

At this point, if the customer has not made a choice we will generate one for the customer based on the information in the customer field provided in the request. After this action the session will be \"frozen\" and could not be modified.\nIf you are using Address Form the customer field is not required anymore.\nWe will also generate a Transport Order

These methods can be used to display the Product Page Widget and allow back and forth communication between widget's iframe and your website.\nUsing addListener, you can register callbacks that will be fired when Product Page Widget emits events.\nAfter you subscribe to events with your callbacks, you can use render method to render an iframe with the widget in a specified container.\nTo see the example integration, jump to Integration example section.\nIntegration steps:\n\n\nEmbed bootstrap script from our CDN stage production.\n\n\nSubscribe to events by calling window._ingridPDPWidgetApi.addListener with chosen event name and provide a callback function.\n\n\nCall window._ingridPDPWidgetApi.render to initialize and display the Product Page Widget. This method takes two argumets, respectively:\n\nthe id attribute of a container, in which the widget will be located\na config object, required to create delivery offering\n\n\n\nImportant notice\nWhen creating a script tag, it is required to add attribute type=\"module\"\n\nAuthorization\nIt is required to specify the token in the auth_token config field used by render method. The token has a pattern of ingrid-http-auth-token:<your_id>. You can obtain your token by reaching out to Ingrid Customer Success Team.\nConfig object\nConfig object consists of required and optional values that could be used for creation of a delivery offering. If the config is invalid, an error event will be sent via addListener callback.\nNote\nTypeScript type definitions for the config object can be found on the bottom of that page\n\nCollecting data\nProduct Page Widget has the possibility to gather analytics data (such as created delivery offerings and their impact on a user's decision on adding item to cart), which then Ingrid will aggregate for you. If you'd like to analytics on, two following steps are required:\n\n\nEnable analytics in Ingrid's system\n\n\nAdd window._ingridPDPWidgetApi.onItemAdded method call when item has been added to the cart.\n\n\nAPI overview\nwindow._ingridPDPWidgetApi object exposes methods listed below:\n\n\nrender(id, config) - used to initialize Product Page Widget. After calling it, an iframe with the widget will be injected into the element with matching id.\n\n\naddListener(event, listener) - available events: ready, error.\n\n\nonItemAdded(sku) - optional method that should be called when the item is added to cart.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4979,"endCharIdx":9086,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZVMgQIEKAk29AqzcfS47/jKpKpe4IG51JfGDblrLNc0="},"983b98df-6e64-4b5e-8b38-520be9a9d453":{"id_":"983b98df-6e64-4b5e-8b38-520be9a9d453","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/product_page/integration"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"53dacf87-faf4-4e79-b9fe-456ab94d21ae","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/product_page/integration"},"hash":"ToSfwk9fJ2v4gi4vNwXsafwiALu0hLnTjELpx+Gehe8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c55d7862-90f5-4273-ad1b-d2a17999121c","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/product_page/integration"},"hash":"9uQX7CQjaXb2irUNvHcr4kB3xVdhXQ9fPkceyI2yd0Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"106f50df-afea-4ddf-befd-f3988aa9e8b1","metadata":{},"hash":"du5iR4+AL9ApiOTJmYj8mSKRXm/3vPVgYkHso9wwjyg="}},"text":"Enable analytics in Ingrid's system\n\n\nAdd window._ingridPDPWidgetApi.onItemAdded method call when item has been added to the cart.\n\n\nAPI overview\nwindow._ingridPDPWidgetApi object exposes methods listed below:\n\n\nrender(id, config) - used to initialize Product Page Widget.

Accurate and timely delivery information is a crucial part of the Tracking Journey, as it contributes to increased satisfaction and eases anxiety around the delivery process.\nIngrid Delivery Tracking comes with a built-in mechanism that keeps track of the estimates, allowing for updates not only from the carriers end during the delivery stage but also from the merchants during order's preparation stage.\nEstimated Delivery Time\nThe most important promise to the End Customer, the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), indicating when a parcel will be delivered to selected delivery address.\n\n\nETA promise can be provided to the Ingrid System in a few ways:\n\nSourced from the Ingrid Checkout Session (Ingrid Delivery Checkout)\n\nIf you use Ingrid Delivery Checkout together with Ingrid Delivery Tracking, the delivery promise presented to the Customer upon completion of a checkout session will be automatically collected by the ETA tracking mechanism implemented in Delivery Tracking and shown on the Tracking Widget/Page.\n\nSourced from the createTrackingOrder request (Integration Guide)\n\nTo provide comprehensive information on the estimated delivery times for orders originating outside of the Ingrid System, you can include them in the createTrackingOrder request (see promises in the example)\n\nSourced from Order Events (Tracking API)\n\nIn case ETA is not known prior to creating an order, or in case it changed during the preparation stage (e.g. due to a high volume of orders), Tracking API (publishOrderEvent endpoint) allows you to post ETA updates along with an order-level event. Those events are meant to provide more granular updates and enhance the parcel tracking experience even before the parcel is ready to leave the warehouse.\n\nSourced from Carrier Tracking Events\n\nAfter a parcel is in a Carrier's hands, it is their turn to provide the End Customer with tracking updates. This includes information on the Estimated Delivery Time. When the Ingrid System receives a tracking event containing an update on ETA, it is automatically recognised by the ETA tracking mechanism and shown on the Widget/Page to give the End Customer a clear picture of when their delivery will arrive.\nKeeping track of the ETA\nThe importance of ETAs extends beyond timely delivery expectations. Providing real-time updates, including information on when deliveries are running late, is crucial to achieving transparent and meaningful communication with Customers. The ETA tracking mechanism marks ETA as exceeded as soon as the latest ETA date has passed. As a result, Tracking Widget/Page shows an alert to proactively inform the End Customer about the delay.\n\nEstimated Submission Time\nIngrid Delivery Tracking is designed to provide information about the entire Delivery Journey. Since this starts with the End Customer placing an order, we also track another important promise: the Estimated Submission Time Promise.\nEstimated Time of Submission (ETS) indicates the day the parcel will be picked up by the Carrier.\n\nSimilar to the Estimated Delivery Time promise, ETS can be provided to Ingrid System in a few ways:\n\nSourced from the Ingrid Checkout Session (Ingrid Delivery Checkout)\n\nAlong with ETA, the completed checkout session contains information about the estimated carrier pickup time. This value will be collected automatically by the ETA tracking mechanism and presented to the End Customer on the Widget/Page as Estimated Submission Time.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4971,"endCharIdx":10161,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"sc1zg9NaD7f4omMo0I96mfDJBmQudRK9XkF/KxdopLY="},"654caf86-3289-43e0-99b2-35622fac87d6":{"id_":"654caf86-3289-43e0-99b2-35622fac87d6","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/tracking_features/estimates/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"085af1a7-a47c-4b04-a6db-1f3f5424cc1d","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/tracking_features/estimates/"},"hash":"QyFp1n9C3g0bWYKlIiIlUP8WIaRvsVJNhmSENpTL8eM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9c0d96ed-e8f5-4f9a-bfac-fb571f9004b8","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/tracking_features/estimates/"},"hash":"ZtGjxeXWecIl6GNP4FHoKm7PCQQ+pwLlPx6JxO+TO/I="}},"text":"Sourced from the createTrackingOrder request (Integration Guide)\nETS can be also included in the createTrackingOrder request if you use Ingrid Delivery Tracking to track orders created outside the Ingrid System.\n\n\nSourced from Order Events (Order Level Events)\n\n\nMultiple events can impact and extend the preparation time of an order, causing the submission date to be postponed. Order Events are a way to pass such information to the Ingrid System and make it visible on the Tracking Widget/Page for the End Customer to stay updated. Apart from an ETA update, order-level events allow for an ETS promise update.\n\nEstimated Submission Time is also tracked by the ETA tracking feture and can be exceeded. When ETS is marked as exceeded, the exceeded value is no longer shown to the End Customer on the Tracking Widget/Page.\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nOverview\n\nEstimated Delivery Time\n\nKeeping track of the ETA\n\nEstimated Submission Time\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":10164,"endCharIdx":11179,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AIkC7p0DNwZwEmOjDx199E7ugtBdN3V8YFHGYsPt3XQ="},"2c155b7c-ce8c-499d-a312-077edb951604":{"id_":"2c155b7c-ce8c-499d-a312-077edb951604","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/carriers/integrate_with_ingrid/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"d529daa5-c032-47ad-8184-3c5d3262dcd0","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/carriers/integrate_with_ingrid/"},"hash":"8xFXWAcOcV6XPkBaIZHpOZe7g65LKagiWFHneyxm9oA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"10b8ca5b-0c4c-4b74-b557-51c9446f0395","metadata":{},"hash":"Rcy/0AUYTXsDLIyIbt0GnDzdDoyHmFi2seZmv0aH8sc="}},"text":"Integrate with Ingrid | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

A merchant can have one or more sites, which are online shops operated by that merchant.\nSite\nA single shop or website (more precisely a web application) where offerings to customers are made that is operated by the merchant. Each site is uniquely identified for a merchant.\nCarrier\nA party that performs the delivery of the actual parcels and packages sent by the merchant to their customers, e.g. your country's national postal services (if Ingrid integrates with them).\nConfiguration\nThe underlying settings for how Ingrid products will work in the specific site setting. Configuration enables merchants to control and customise how the Ingrid products work such as: adding carrier products to their offering, adjust delivery prices, turn on/off product features etc.\nSession\nMain object of the Delivery Checkout product. It has its own separate section in our development documentation.\nDelivery Group\nRepresents a group of cart items that will be delivered to the customer in separate packages.\nIt has its own separate section in our development documentation.\nCarrier product\nDelivery products that are offered from carriers to merchants. Carriers define their products and Ingrid integrates with them. It is separate from the shipping method, because the merchant can customise the details of the carrier product by setting e.g. price/price rules and when to offer the carrier product.\nNote\nTo use a carrier product, it has to be applied to Ingrid configuration in the Ingrid Merchant Platform for the given site.\n\nShipping method\nIt is the Ingrid internal representation of a delivery method that can be used in an Ingrid context. Shipping methods represents carrier products. Shipping methods are carrier product specific. A Shipping method can be an express home delivery or a pickup point delivery.\nNote\nUser of Ingrid Merchant Platform assigns carrier products while they are operated as Shipping methods in Ingrid.\n\nCategory\nAlso known as delivery category. The entity that defines a delivery offering that will be selectable in the Delivery Checkout for the consumer. Categories contains carrier products (represented as shipping methods). Merchant can customise the delivery categories by controlling what the Delivery category offerings is in terms of e.g. base Delivery Time, Delivery Time format (weekday vs. date) etc.\nCategory option\nA concrete delivery choice selected by the customer. For example, we have a category to a pickup point, that presents the user a list of 20 pickup points to choose from. A single choice is a category option, even though they all belong to the same category.\nOrder\nIt is a representation of a completed session. Order holds all the necessary information about the result of user interaction with the Delivery Checkout needed to fulfill the delivery, such as cart information, delivery address, customer details and others.\nNote\nIngrid order is intended to be related with an order in the merchant's e-commerce system. The linking can be done by using external_id field.\n\nShipment\nIt is an order we began fulfilling. Shipment consists of data required by the carrier to make a delivery i.e. addresses, parcel details and delivery times. It can be created based on data held in order alone, but it can also be customized to represent complex scenarios (return deliveries, duty declarations, consolidated deliveries).\nIngrid Merchant Platform (IMP)\nIt is the administration portal for Ingrid clients. It can be used to manage orders, configure widgets, track shipments and more.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nMerchant\n\nSite\n\nCarrier\n\nConfiguration\n\nSession\n\nDelivery Group\n\nCarrier product\n\nShipping method\n\nCategory\n\nCategory option\n\nOrder\n\nShipment\n\nIngrid Merchant Platform (IMP)\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":5559,"endCharIdx":10650,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"U/4V9jJ+6PMkjTormiEL51kNld8UpJdWBXdJJ3498Ck="},"d35eccfd-5022-4f7f-965c-8dccbe2480dc":{"id_":"d35eccfd-5022-4f7f-965c-8dccbe2480dc","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/reference/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"39b5cc42-363c-47b1-9f0a-83e1e4bc93d4","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/reference/"},"hash":"zvMgV5VXV2yvm4AwT2I9y0zY/waPzbUQfoTs8uVG6EA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e1c8c7e3-6ee9-4b6c-9cba-e3d640f40805","metadata":{},"hash":"O9dsdDbnJa8ussfMmYGZdrbYs9BLE5nnWqZs0i2ZYxE="}},"text":"Reference | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

We'll go through patterns for\nembedding the shipping selector, handle updates to cart or customer information and\nmarking the checkout session as completed in SIW API.\nUsing correct endpoints for integration\nMake sure that you are using correct API endpoint when using different environments for testing and production releases.\n\nNote\nPlease note that we reserve the right to introduce additional fields to our API responses without prior notification. Users are encouraged to regularly check for updates in our documentation for any changes that may impact their integration.\n\nCreating a session\nThe first thing you need to do before you can embed the shipping selector in your\ncheckout page is to create a session. This is done by calling session.create which returns session details and an HTML snippet.\nEach Session has an ID that can be used to later fetch, update or\ncomplete the session. It is recommended that you store the\nsession id together with the customer's order.\nEmbed the Delivery Checkout\nThe responses of session.create and session.get contain the attribute\ncalled html_snippet which includes the html snippet to display the shipping\nselector in your checkout page. Just put it in the part of the page where you\nwant the Delivery Checkout to be displayed.\nThe snippet will then download and execute our bootstrap.js script which spawns the iframes and sets up channels of communication for session management.\nLive React examples\nAll code examples come from our live React code sandbox. You can copy the snippets straight from there 📋","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4979,"endCharIdx":8250,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"j8beaTKgO7zP7m0nVO6Klz4gN3l1HE33Hk8dNgIP+10="},"5aea59a6-7a72-469f-914c-5bad7bc3e197":{"id_":"5aea59a6-7a72-469f-914c-5bad7bc3e197","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"2e4ce8e3-6444-429f-a011-4a4b8a676cb0","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/integration/"},"hash":"ylvcK3zndQqXk+GOdiVgnqtRUBieQFgrYMoY37TASXY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9ea90839-687a-4acc-925e-859cbefbd306","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/integration/"},"hash":"++QeesbHkqywyNb8Kly3XTUmj0QELvdPuya7hkCdxD8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8f85cdcd-fbb0-4d2f-a566-790a080d297d","metadata":{},"hash":"3aKB8dNqkYTZ82lSs3XYb77H+ZzeJzJGPYXU/SXs27A="}},"text":"const handleCreateSession = async () => {  try {    // Call your backend and they call siw/session.create    const sessionResponse = await createSession();    // Embed the widget on the page    widgetWrapperRef.current.innerHTML = HTMLSnippet;    // Trick the browser to run the script, explained below    replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));  } catch {    // We don't believe it's possible but if our service fails, you render the fallback for the widget here  }};\n\nCopy\nWarning\nIf you're dynamically inserting the HTML snippet in the DOM, most browsers won't execute the script embedded in it. If you're lucky enough to have jQuery on your page, you can use its append() function or feel free to copy the snippet below. It removes and inserts back the script nodes to trick the browser to execute them\n\nfunction replaceScriptNode(node) {  if (isScriptNode(node) && !isExternalScript(node)) {    node.parentNode.replaceChild(cloneScriptNode(node), node);  } else {    var i = 0,      children = node.childNodes;    while (i < children.length) {      replaceScriptNode(children[i++]);    }  }  return node;}function isScriptNode(node) {  return node.tagName === \"SCRIPT\";}function isExternalScript(node) {  return !!node.src && node.src !== \"\";}function cloneScriptNode(node) {  var script = document.createElement(\"script\");  script.text = node.innerHTML;  for (var i = node.attributes.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {    script.setAttribute(node.attributes[i].name, node.attributes[i].value);  }  return script;}replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));\n\nCopy\n\nCaveats\nThe HTML snippet is designed to only be added to the page once.\nSo if you are using AJAX to load the snippet you should make sure\nthat this only happens once. Adding or replacing it multiple times\nwill cause errors.\nHowever, there is an exception to that when using Multiple widgets.\nIt allows you to add many checkout widgets to the page, but each has different id and in that case,\nthe above constraint applies to each unique widget.\n\nWarning\nhtml_snippet contains an element with unique id shipwallet-container. Make sure there’s no other element on the page with the same ID, otherwise the widget won't load.\nYou can override the default unique id with your own by requesting a merchant configuration change from our Customer Support.\n\nUpdating the cart and session\nCheckout pages often allow the user to alter the contents of the cart, locale, customer information or anything else that the session is based on. Change in any of those may adjust the available shipping options or the visual apperance of the widget\nIn such case, you will need to update the session to inform Ingrid about the changes.\nHowever, you will also have to suspend the widget, making it non-interactive for the time of the request, and resume it after you get a response from our API.\nThis allows the widget to synchronise it's state with the backend service.\nWarning\nSuspending and resuming the widget too often will cause a poor experience for the user.\nIt is completely unnecessary when reacting to user events.\nYou only want to do this if you made an api call towards update session as a result of a user interaction on your website affecting the session arguments\n\nTwo methods are exposed on the window._sw object.\n\nsuspend - Puts the widget in a freezed state with a spinner covering the whole UI\nresume - Unlocks the widget, triggering an internal BE request for synchronizationconst handleUpdateSession = async () => {  window._sw((api) => api.suspend());  await updateSession(session.id);  window._sw((api) => api.resume());};\n\nCopy\nHandling abandoned carts\nIn some cases customers can drop out of the checkout process early.Either\nbecause they didn't have time to complete the purchase or they went on to\ncontinue shopping on the page or for some other reason.In cases like this,\nwhen the customer returns, we want them to continue where they left off.By storing the session ID, we can fetch an existing session instead of creating a new one.This might be easier to follow in our live demo.Here's how it could be handled:\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {  initDeliveryCheckout();}, []);const initDeliveryCheckout = async () => {  const existingSessionID = window.localStorage.getItem(\"ingrid-session-id\");

 if (existingSessionID) {    const getSessionResponse = await getSession(existingSessionID);    handleIngridInitialize(getSessionResponse.data.session, getSessionResponse.data.html_snippet);  } else {    handleCreateSession();  }};const handleIngridInitialize = (session: SIWSessionDTO, HTMLSnippet: string) => {  // session.get and session.create should be handled the same way.We've created this utility function  // to abstract adding the snippet to the page and setting up event listeners without doubling the code  widgetWrapperRef.current!.innerHTML = HTMLSnippet;  replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));  window._sw!((api) => {    api.on(\"data_changed\", (data, meta) => {      if (meta.price_changed) {        setShippingPrice(data.price);      }    });  });};const handleCreateSession = async () => {  try {    const sessionResponse = await createSession();    handleIngridInitialize(sessionResponse.data.session, sessionResponse.data.html_snippet);    // You want to save the session ID somewhere, so when the user abandons the checkout    // you can later restore the session, instead of creating a new one    window.localStorage.setItem(\"ingrid-session-id\", sessionResponse.data.session.id);  } catch {}};\n\nCopy\nNote\nIf, for some reason, the session cannot be found when you try to call\nsession.update or session.get with a previous session ID we suggest that\nyou handle this error in this case by creating an entirely new session.Subscribing to user events\nUser can perform a number of actions that can affect your checkout, e.g.user changing the shipping option can cause a shipping price change.Luckily, the moment the widget attaches itself to the page, it sets up a Javascript API available via window._sw where you can set up listeners for events.You would usually do this right after session.create or session.get.This is how we handle it in our React example\n\nconst handleCreateSession = async () => {  // ...call session create backend and add the snippet to the page  // Update the shipping price any time option is changed  window._sw(function (api) {    api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {      if (meta.price_changed) {        updateCart(data.price);      }    });  });};\n\nCopy\nAvailable events\ndata_changed\nInstead of exposing multiple 'change' events with multiple properties, Delivery Checkout exposes one 'change' event and allows you to decide what data you care about.The callback receives two arguments\n\ndata: {  delivery_type: 'delivery' | 'mailbox' | 'pickup' | 'instore';  price: number;  search_address: {    country: string;    postal_code: string;    address_lines?: string[];    city?: string;    region?: string;  };  shipping_method: string;  external_method_id?: string;}\n\nCopy\nand\n\nmeta: {  delivery_type_changed: boolean;  external_method_id_changed: boolean;  price_changed: boolean;  search_address_changed: boolean;  shipping_method_changed: boolean;  initial_load: boolean;}\n\nCopy\nmeta.initial_load: true informs you that this is the moment where values are actually set, not updated,\nas this is the first render of the widget.All that looks kind of complicated, how does one use it?Say you want to know when the shipping price changes to update the total price on the cart\n\nwindow._sw(function (api) {  api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {    if (meta.price_changed) {      updateCart(data.price);    }  });});\n\nCopy\nIf you want to also know when the shipping method changes\n\nwindow._sw(function (api) {  api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {    if (meta.shipping_method_changed) {      sendToAnalyticsService(data.shipping_method);    }    if (meta.price_changed) {      updateCart(data.price);    }  });});\n\nCopy\nYou can have more if statements or setup multiple data_changed event listeners if that's your jam.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1n44bMzVGe0xdj3C7g5Rmpl4u/KZPoRWxDXQYNNkhSE="},"08b8e9e9-d31c-4c70-b64e-424a55df499c":{"id_":"08b8e9e9-d31c-4c70-b64e-424a55df499c","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"2e4ce8e3-6444-429f-a011-4a4b8a676cb0","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/integration/"},"hash":"ylvcK3zndQqXk+GOdiVgnqtRUBieQFgrYMoY37TASXY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8f85cdcd-fbb0-4d2f-a566-790a080d297d","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/integration/"},"hash":"3aKB8dNqkYTZ82lSs3XYb77H+ZzeJzJGPYXU/SXs27A="}},"text":"All that looks kind of complicated, how does one use it?Say you want to know when the shipping price changes to update the total price on the cart\n\nwindow._sw(function (api) {  api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {    if (meta.price_changed) {      updateCart(data.price);

 });});\n\nCopy\nno_shipping_options\nEmitted when the address is provided but Ingrid can't find any shipping options for it.Note that this requires additional configuration on Ingrid side to be visible.To do that, you will have to contact our support team\n\nwindow._sw(function (api) {  api.on(\"no_shipping_options\", function () {    console.log(\"no shipping options\");  });});\n\nCopy\nNote\nIf you render multiple widgets simultaneously, then global variable for event subscription is not\ncalled _sw, see Multiple widgets.error\nThe event is emitted when an unexpected error occurs — for example, it could be network or authorisation error.Error object consists of type and severity fields.window._sw((api) =>  api.on(\"error\", (data) => {    console.log(\"error\", data); // { type: 'missing_session_token', severity: 'fatal' }  }));\n\nCopy\ndestroy\nThis method is useful when you want to reinitialize Checkout Widget.This API method accepts a callback which is ran after the Checkout Widget cleanup is complete.window._sw((api) =>  api.destroy(() => {    handleInitializeCheckoutWidget();  }));\n\nCopy\nCompleting session\nYou should complete the session after receiving confirmation from payment system.It marks the session as complete and creates a Transport Order in the Ingrid system.If customer address is provided during session completion and it differs from the search address used during the session lifetime, shipping options might get recalculated.The recalculation may happen when the selected shipping option was a home delivery one or the search address contained neither a country nor a postal code.Search address drives the shipping option generation during the session lifetime, but can be overridden under those conditions during session complete.Tip\nWhen issuing the complete session request, include the external order ID if possible.You can find more information about external order ID in the subsection using external order identifier.Using external order identifier\nIt is highly encouraged to pass external order identifier (external ID for short) in your session create/update/complete requests.Passing it in one of those requests will store the external ID along with the other session data.Note\nBenefits of using external ID are:\n\nbeing able to search by your external order ID in Ingrid Merchant Platform transport orders,\nwhen booking with Ingrid, your external order ID will be propagated to the booking system,\nbeing able to register and load the tracking widget using the external order ID provided by the merchant.\n\n\nYou can pass the external_id field as part of your session create/update/complete request. The following snippet shows how you can pass it in the request via curl.\n\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.ingrid.com/v1/siw/session.create' \\--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\--header 'Authorization: Bearer your-site-token' \\--data-raw '{  \"purchase_country\": \"SE\",  \"purchase_currency\": \"EUR\",  \"locale\": \"en-US\",  \"cart\": {    \"total_value\": 1000,    \"currency\": \"EUR\",    \"items\": [      {        \"sku\": \"a3ec72d0-836f-4668-9c54-5c86d67ca897\",        \"name\": \"Keyboard\",        \"quantity\": 1,        \"price\": 1000      }    ]  },  \"external_id\": \"your-order-id\"}'\n\nCopy\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nCreating a session\n\nEmbed the Delivery Checkout\n\nUpdating the cart and session\n\nHandling abandoned carts\n\nSubscribing to user events\n\nAvailable events\n\n\n\nCompleting session\n\nUsing external order identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0ufawh8A4BxtAAsToCJUukD9+lDdE22sCSkNUpZpLGY="},"009b4399-ffd5-42e9-be9c-39cfa43f93f7":{"id_":"009b4399-ffd5-42e9-be9c-39cfa43f93f7","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"72f0adb2-df31-4a2f-8d8a-bb51b87656d2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"hash":"rvSkqVvW8zkRlVK0gRy/J+7bDmGaMH7u8bASJZlN/uc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a00001e1-d579-4f5d-b3dc-36e08332868e","metadata":{},"hash":"BKitHRo+DDuG3R6LtnlVC12PQuoNzg2B/TuqKQ9K95Q="}},"text":"Frontend Integration | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

steps of\nintegrating your e-commerce site with Delivery Checkout. We'll go through patterns for\nembedding the shipping selector, handling updates to cart or customer information and\nmarking the checkout session as completed in the Delivery Checkout API.\nUsing correct endpoints for integration\nMake sure that you are using correct API endpoint when using different environments for testing and production releases.\n\nCreating a session\nThe first thing you need to do before you can embed the shipping selector in your\ncheckout page is to create a session. This is done by calling session.create which returns session details and an HTML snippet.\nEach Session has an ID that can be used to later fetch, update or\ncomplete the session. It is recommended that you store the\nsession ID together with the customer's order.\nEmbed the Delivery Checkout\nThe responses of session.create and session.pull contain the attribute\ncalled html_snippet which includes the HTML snippet to display the shipping\nselector in your checkout page. Just put it in the part of the page where you\nwant the Delivery Checkout to be displayed.\nThe snippet will then download and execute our bootstrap.js script which spawns the iframes and sets up channels of communication for session management.\n\nconst handleCreateSession = async () => {  try {    // Call your backend and they call siw/session.create    const sessionResponse = await createSession();    // Embed the widget on the page    widgetWrapperRef.current.innerHTML = HTMLSnippet;    // Trick the browser to run the script, explained below    replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));  } catch {    // We don't believe it's possible but if our service fails, you render the fallback for the widget here  }};\n\nCopy\nWarning\nIf you're dynamically inserting the HTML snippet in the DOM, most browsers won't execute the script embedded in it. If you're lucky enough to have jQuery on your page, you can use its append() function or feel free to copy the snippet below. It removes and inserts back the script nodes to trick the browser to execute them\n\nfunction replaceScriptNode(node) {  if (isScriptNode(node) && !isExternalScript(node)) {    node.parentNode.replaceChild(cloneScriptNode(node), node);  } else {    var i = 0,      children = node.childNodes;    while (i < children.length) {      replaceScriptNode(children[i++]);    }  }  return node;}function isScriptNode(node) {  return node.tagName === \"SCRIPT\";}function isExternalScript(node) {  return !!node.src && node.src !== \"\";}function cloneScriptNode(node) {  var script = document.createElement(\"script\");  script.text = node.innerHTML;  for (var i = node.attributes.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {    script.setAttribute(node.attributes[i].name, node.attributes[i].value);  }  return script;}replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));\n\nCopy\n\nCaveats\nThe HTML snippet is designed to only be added to the page once.\nSo if you are using AJAX to load the snippet you should make sure\nthat this only happens once. Adding or replacing it multiple times\nwill cause errors.\n\nWarning\nhtml_snippet contains an element with unique id shipwallet-container. Make sure there’s no other element on the page with the same ID, otherwise the widget won't load.\nYou can override the default unique id with your own by requesting a merchant configuration change from our Customer Support.\n\nUpdating the cart and session\nCheckout pages often allow the user to alter the contents of the cart, locale, customer information or anything else that the session is based on. Change in any of those may adjust the available delivery options or the visual apperance of the widget\nIn such case, you will need to update the session to inform Ingrid about the changes.\nHowever, you will also have to suspend the widget, making it non-interactive for the time of the request, and resume it after you get a response from our API.\nThis allows the widget to synchronise it's state with the backend service.\nWarning\nSuspending and resuming the widget too often will cause a poor experience for the user.\nIt's completely unnecessary when receiving user events.\nYou only want to do this if you made an api call towards update session as a result of a user interaction on your website affecting the session arguments\n\nTwo methods are exposed on the window._sw object.\n\nsuspend - Puts the widget in a freezed state with a spinner covering the whole UI\nresume - Unlocks the widget, triggering an internal BE request for synchronization","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":5571,"endCharIdx":11180,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Jk2k/YJ5Mldth4sLeumZM2VpyN+/WvVzwOuUKdaJUdw="},"a6098be6-f2d5-4c1c-a5f8-c6bcc19545c6":{"id_":"a6098be6-f2d5-4c1c-a5f8-c6bcc19545c6","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"72f0adb2-df31-4a2f-8d8a-bb51b87656d2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"hash":"rvSkqVvW8zkRlVK0gRy/J+7bDmGaMH7u8bASJZlN/uc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"80197dde-c358-4a6d-84f1-8f6424df3c42","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"hash":"vBHuTelpV2Jy93aVejMcyhCZMmBPysq0g7z6vU+19/8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"324ba1a3-9d2d-4160-8473-dc96b4a7a4cc","metadata":{},"hash":"2IIlFTabaYMq6hC/Gahq2Nx0g32QnVjgc6oYhXbIhZM="}},"text":"const handleUpdateSession = async () => {  window._sw((api) => api.suspend());  await updateSession(session.id);  window._sw((api) => api.resume());};\n\nCopy\nHandling abandoned carts\nIn some cases customers can drop out of the checkout process early. Either\nbecause they didn't have time to complete the purchase or they went on to\ncontinue shopping on the page or for some other reason. In cases like this,\nwhen the customer returns, we want them to continue where they left off.\nBy storing the session ID, we can fetch an existing session instead of creating a new one.\nHere's how it could be handled:\n\nReact.useEffect(() => {  initDeliveryCheckout();}, []);const initDeliveryCheckout = async () => {  const existingSessionID = window.localStorage.getItem(\"ingrid-session-id\");  if (existingSessionID) {    const getSessionResponse = await getSession(existingSessionID);    handleIngridInitialize(getSessionResponse.data.session, getSessionResponse.data.html_snippet);  } else {    handleCreateSession();  }};const handleIngridInitialize = (session: SIWSessionDTO, HTMLSnippet: string) => {  // session.pull and session.create should be handled the same way. We've created this utility function  // to abstract adding the snippet to the page and setting up event listeners without doubling the code  widgetWrapperRef.current!.innerHTML = HTMLSnippet;  replaceScriptNode(document.getElementById(\"shipwallet-container\"));  window._sw!((api) => {    api.on(\"data_changed\", (data, meta) => {      if (meta.price_changed) {        setShippingPrice(data.price);      }    });  });};const handleCreateSession = async () => {  try {    const sessionResponse = await createSession();    handleIngridInitialize(sessionResponse.data.session, sessionResponse.data.html_snippet);    // You want to save the session ID somewhere, so when the user abandons the checkout    // you can later restore the session, instead of creating a new one    window.localStorage.setItem(\"ingrid-session-id\", sessionResponse.data.session.id);  } catch {}};\n\nCopy\nNote\nIf, for some reason, the session cannot be found when you try to call\n`session.update` or `session.pull` with a previous session ID we suggest that\nyou handle this error in this case by creating an entirely new session.\n\nSubscribing to user events\nUser can perform a number of actions that can affect your checkout, e.g. user changing the category option can cause a shipping price change.\nLuckily, the moment the widget attaches itself to the page, it sets up a Javascript API available via window._sw where you can set up listeners for events.\nYou would usually do this right after session.create or session.pull.\n\nconst handleCreateSession = async () => {  // ...call session create backend and add the snippet to the page  // Update the shipping price any time option is changed  window._sw(function (api) {    api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {      if (meta.price_changed) {        updateCart(data.price);      }    });  });};\n\nCopy\nAvailable events\nsummary_changed\nUseful when utilising Address Form and Delivery Groups features. If you don't have those enabled, you want to go with the Data Changed event.\nExposes two arguments:\n\ndata: {  // Summarised value of all delivery groups  total_value: number;  // Delivery address provided by the user in the Delivery Checkout  delivery_address: Recipient | undefined;  // Billing address provided by the user in the Delivery Checkout  billing_address: Recipient | undefined;}\n\nCopy\n\n\nmeta: {  total_value_changed: boolean;  delivery_address_changed: boolean;  billing_address_changed: boolean;}\n\nCopy\nYou can see detailed breakdown of the Recipient here\ndata_changed\nInstead of exposing multiple 'change' events with multiple properties, Delivery Checkout exposes one 'change' event and allows you to decide what data you care about.\nThe callback receives two arguments\n\ndata: {  delivery_type: 'delivery' | 'mailbox' | 'pickup' | 'instore';  price: number;  search_address: {    country: string;    postal_code: string;    address_lines?: string[];    city?: string;    region?: string;  };  shipping_method: string;  external_method_id?: string;  category_name: string;  pickup_location?: {    address: {          country: string;          postal_code: string;          address_lines: string[];          city: string;          coordinates: Coordinates;        };        name: string;  }}\n\nCopy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":11183,"endCharIdx":15581,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+qeECTrXjD3meeqZJvC63NpIdBa02X/zjQrHeuvuXuE="},"324ba1a3-9d2d-4160-8473-dc96b4a7a4cc":{"id_":"324ba1a3-9d2d-4160-8473-dc96b4a7a4cc","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"72f0adb2-df31-4a2f-8d8a-bb51b87656d2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"hash":"rvSkqVvW8zkRlVK0gRy/J+7bDmGaMH7u8bASJZlN/uc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a6098be6-f2d5-4c1c-a5f8-c6bcc19545c6","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"hash":"zN9BY7GE+XS5lOmSpZdrJdfCgnjsfJKBpRvGd682QpE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6d311d01-e821-4210-8eb0-30ea4f874f64","metadata":{},"hash":"mCDSy8P9dtWqdp25f8S++gq0Jpu46ZAGXzMtlLowKLU="}},"text":"meta: {  delivery_type_changed: boolean;  external_method_id_changed: boolean;  price_changed: boolean;  search_address_changed: boolean;  shipping_method_changed: boolean;  initial_load: boolean;  category_name_changed: boolean;  pickup_location_changed: boolean;}\n\nCopy\nmeta.initial_load: true informs you that this is the moment where values are actually set, not updated,\nas this is the first render of the widget.\nAll that looks kind of complicated, how does one use it?\nSay you want to know when the shipping price changes to update the total price on the cart\n\nwindow._sw(function (api) {  api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {    if (meta.price_changed) {      updateCart(data.price);    }  });});\n\nCopy\nIf you want to also know when the shipping method changes\n\nwindow._sw(function (api) {  api.on(\"data_changed\", function (data, meta) {    if (meta.shipping_method_changed) {      sendToAnalyticsService(data.shipping_method);    }    if (meta.price_changed) {      updateCart(data.price);    }  });});\n\nCopy\nYou can have more if statements or setup multiple data_changed event listeners if that's your jam.\nloaded\nEmitted when the widget is fully loaded and interactive.

This API method accepts a callback that runs after the Checkout Widget cleanup is complete.\n\nwindow._sw((api) =>  api.destroy(() => {    handleInitializeCheckoutWidget();  }));\n\nCopy\nCompleting session\nYou should complete the session after receiving confirmation from payment system. It marks the session as complete and creates a Transport Order in the Ingrid system.\nTip\nWhen issuing the complete session request, include the external order ID if possible. You can find more information about external order ID in the subsection using external order identifier.\n\nUsing external order identifier\nIt is highly encouraged to pass external order identifier (external ID for short) in your session create/update/complete requests.\nPassing it in one of those requests will store the external ID along with the other session data.\nNote\nBenefits of using external ID are:\n\nbeing able to search by your external order ID in Ingrid Merchant Platform transport orders,\nwhen booking with Ingrid, your external order ID will be propagated to the booking system,\nbeing able to register and load the tracking widget using the external order ID provided by the merchant.\n\n\nYou can pass the external_id field as part of your session create/update/complete request. The following snippet shows how you can pass it in the request via curl.\n\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://api.ingrid.com/v1/delivery_checkout/session.create' \\--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\--header 'Authorization: Bearer your-site-token' \\--data-raw '{  \"purchase_country\": \"SE\",  \"purchase_currency\": \"SEK\",  \"locales\": [    \"sv-SE\"  ],  \"search_address\": {    \"postal_code\": \"11239\",    \"country\": \"SE\"  },  \"cart\": {      \"cart_id\": \"unique_id\",      \"total_value\": 129900,      \"currency\": \"SEK\",      \"items\": [        {          \"sku\": \"SKU12345\",          \"name\": \"Saucony Shadow 6000\",          \"quantity\": 1,          \"price\": 1000        }      ]   },  \"external_id\": \"your-order-id\"}'\n\nCopy\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":15584,"endCharIdx":19891,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"APqfFn+hZDoDedLiH6iddTk5gp3IDY5Pchp3K3pDnWg="},"6d311d01-e821-4210-8eb0-30ea4f874f64":{"id_":"6d311d01-e821-4210-8eb0-30ea4f874f64","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"72f0adb2-df31-4a2f-8d8a-bb51b87656d2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"hash":"rvSkqVvW8zkRlVK0gRy/J+7bDmGaMH7u8bASJZlN/uc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"324ba1a3-9d2d-4160-8473-dc96b4a7a4cc","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/frontend_integration"},"hash":"2IIlFTabaYMq6hC/Gahq2Nx0g32QnVjgc6oYhXbIhZM="}},"text":"On page\n\n\nCreating a session\n\nEmbed the Delivery Checkout\n\nUpdating the cart and session\n\nHandling abandoned carts\n\nSubscribing to user events\n\nAvailable events\n\n\n\nCompleting session\n\nUsing external order identifier\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":19884,"endCharIdx":20155,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ERfCdd3X1cHWNLOhxWOjzMfbUB3/PfAisx31+6gK50c="},"e84684cb-b254-4540-83c3-640277dee1dd":{"id_":"e84684cb-b254-4540-83c3-640277dee1dd","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/api/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"09c57f88-1551-45b1-b4c3-cb4bb23ad712","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/api/"},"hash":"GrX4YyH7PIs4M255bhWVBy1iFPtvnHhiZ9xlrpdl+D8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7635a18d-c2b0-431d-81d6-49a0b578eaed","metadata":{},"hash":"Pm+0BubAsjr5P7R3EwxYyNT+HzBH8Sq7BpTkoUQHsSU="}},"text":"SIW API | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

feeling\nof the API and the data flows.SIW is responsible for maintaining life cycle of a session that has all the\ndata needed by the shipping selector widget.When a user visits checkout\npage, makes any changes to cart contents, selects shipping options and\ncompletes a purchase, all the relevant data are stored in the session.Every session contains result field which provides information about currently selected delivery option.It contains all important information like:\n\npricing,\ncategory,\nshipping method,\nexternal_method_id,\ndetails of pickup point if applicable.Result field should be used in integration to get final result of session.The example result looks as follows:\n\n{  \"session\": {    \"result\": {      \"shipping\": {        \"shipping_method\": \"pnl-mpc\",        \"delivery_type\": \"pickup\",        \"carrier\": \"PostNord\",        \"product\": \"MyPack Collect\",        \"location\": {          \"external_id\": \"586287\",          \"name\": \"Direkten

simply points us to which area package should be delivered, but it doesn't need to be customer real address.\nThe customer address must be provided by the merchant.\nFor example, if you want to have a package delivered close to your work, you can fill search address with your office address.\nThe customer is a customer home address. It allows performing fraud detection if someone is ordering an expensive item and customer and search addresses are distant to each other.\nThe merchant could compare both addresses and verify if the order is valid by contacting the customer before shipping goods.\n\nComplete Session\nThe session.complete method is used to mark a session as complete. At this\npoint, if the customer haven't made a choice we'll generate one for the\ncustomer based on the information in the Customer property provided in the request.\n::: tip\nSearch address and customer address are two different entities, that serve separate purposes during session lifetime.\nSearch address is provided by the customer and the customer address is always provided by merchant.\nSearch address is used to generate the shipping options that will be presented to the customer. Customer address is the address where the parcel will be sent and should be provided sometime during session lifetime (at the latest during session.complete).\nShipping options may be regenerated under some conditions when the customer address is provided and it differs from the search address.\n:::\nThe sequence diagram below describes the flow between the Customer, Merchant,\nShipping Selector and SIW API when completing a session when the customer checkout.\nSIW APIMerchantCustomerSIW APIMerchantCustomerCompletes the orderCall /session.completeReturn completed session stateRedirects to confirmation page\n\nCustomer completes the transaction\nMerchant completes the session using session.complete method\nSIW API returns session in a completed state. The SelectedShippingOption and tos_id are also returned.\nMerchant redirects the customer to the confirmation page\n\n\nOn session complete call a tos_id will be returned. This id is important if you need to re-open a session as a\ncompleted session is \"frozen\" and cannot be modified. You can use tos_id to clone a completed session.\n\nExample Calls\nRequest Response\n\nRequest\n\nPOST /v1/siw/session.complete HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type:

Notification triggers are specific conditions or events that will automatically initiate the sending of notifications to customers. A trigger can be configured for multiple channels and is compatible with external integrations as well as Ingrid Default notifications.\nProgress based Notifications Triggers\nProgress-based triggers are designed to inform the End Customer about the status of their parcels as they move through the delivery process. Those triggers are invoked by the change of step in the Harmonised Progress and each of those can be configured using any of the available channels.\nThere are two ways a change in the progress steps can activate a tigger:\n\nProgress moves directly to a step with a dedidated Progress Notification. A trigger specific to that step will be invoked automatically.\nProgress skips the step with a dedicated trigger and moves directly to the next step that does not have its own trigger. In this scenario, a trigger specific to the lastest step supporting a dedicated trigger will be invoked automatically.\n\nThe actual delivery process can be unpredictable, and some steps might be skipped. No worries, though, Notifications Triggers will be fired and the End Customers updated as long as the delivery keeps moving forward.\nSmart sending\nTo avoid overwhelming End Customers with messages, we implemented a mechanism filtering out redundant Progress Triggers. This ensures system won't activate multiple progress based triggers for the same delivery step or outdated information if a newer update is available.\n\nLogic and event based Notifications Triggers\nLogic- and event-based Notifications Triggers foster a proactive communication approach by leveraging rule-based logic. This enables Triggers to activate in response to non-progress events or other predefined conditions. Similar to Progress Triggers, these Triggers can be configured for each of the available channels.\nNon-progress events refer to all of the other events Ingrid Tracking system receives that do not have a dedicated step in the Harmonised Progress. Some examples include:\n\ncarrier events such as a delayed delivery or failed delivery attempt,\ninformation from an exteral system that an order receipt document is available,\ninformation from a WMS about an order cancellation.\n\nRule-based logic allows to define a set of conditions that must be met in order to activate a trigger.\nIngrid Notifications Triggers\nThe list of currently available Ingrid Notifications Triggers:\n\n\n\n\nTrigger Name\nDescription","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4984,"endCharIdx":9168,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"KrFK1u2UTV6jpBtsKqsCN10UieK1DiNskVcdK+jFeg8="},"29a72208-93ea-4b2f-9b69-87c4bdcc2cd7":{"id_":"29a72208-93ea-4b2f-9b69-87c4bdcc2cd7","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/notifications/triggers/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"49d76bf0-8979-4c7d-864d-5246fc60e142","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/notifications/triggers/"},"hash":"t9YuR7ai9/Ra1vUs6JAAbF7mmN/gEDGVl+bAjQs4jZw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"811f1005-7f85-417f-a45d-2a03244e0216","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/notifications/triggers/"},"hash":"yhwNJgWz2hSBZHwmxRWRapGEkCA48kE/Ge1vKIIDAtQ="}},"text":"Trigger Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nIngrid - Order Confirmed\nOrder succesfully created from checkout session or registered from an external system\n\nIngrid - Order Confirmed Centra\nOrder confirmed by Centra by an authorized payment\n\nIngrid - Order Prepared\nOrder prepared by Warehouse and ready for shipping\n\nIngrid - Cancelled\nOrder cancelled by Merchant as all ordered items are not available (zero pick)\n\nIngrid - Cancelled by Customer\nOrder cancelled on Customer's request, before fulfilment is done (grace period)\n\nIngrid - Short Pick Items\nSome of the ordered items are not avaiable and order will be partially fulfilled (short pick)\n\nIngrid - Submitted To Carrier\nParcel handed over to carrier\n\nIngrid - Submission Delayed\nSubmission to carrier will take longer that initially estimated\n\nIngrid - En Route\nParcel in transit\n\nIngrid - Delivery Delayed\nCarrier informed Ingrid about the delay in delivery\n\nIngrid - Out For Delivery\nParcel handed out for final mile delivery\n\nIngrid - Delivery Failed\nA failed delivery attempt happened\n\nIngrid - Delivered to Pickup Point\nParcel arrived to pick-up location and is waiting for End Customer collection\n\nIngrid - Delivered To Consumer\nParcel delivered to Customer's home delivery destination / parcel collected by Customer from pick-up location\n\nIngrid - Pickup Point Reminder\nParcel not yet collected by Customer from a pick-up location\n\nIngrid - Sent Back\nParcel not picked up in time by Customer and sent back to Merchant\n\nIngrid - Return Confirmation\nReturn shipment received at Warehouse\n\nIngrid - Order Receipt\nPDF receipt for order available\n\nIngrid - Return Receipt\nPDF receipt for a full order refund available\n\nIngrid - Price Adjustment Receipt\nPDF for price corrections available\n\nIngrid - Returned to Store\nOrder returned by Customer to Store\n\nIngrid - Returned to Warehouse\nOrder returned by Customer to Warehouse\n\nIngrid - Parcel Refused No Reason\nParcel refused by customer without specifying a reason\n\nIngrid - Parcel Refused Not Wanted\nParcel refused by customer because it was either ordered by mistake or is not needed anymore\n\nIngrid - Parcel Refused Goods Damaged\nParcel refused by customer due to contents being damaged\n\nIngrid - Parcel Refused Packaging Damaged\nParcel refused by customer due to packaging being damaged\n\nIngrid - Parcel Not Collected\nCustomer did not pickup the parcel within the deadline\n\n\n\nIngrid Notifications Triggers are based on use cases gathered from our Merchants.

The set consists of 6 progress notifications and one logic-based text notification. These notifications function as a means of one-way communication with the End Customers.\n\nIf you are interested in using and customizing Default Ingrid Notifications, please reach out to Ingrid Customer Success for details on the required assets.\n\nIngrid Default Progress Notifications\nBoth, email and SMS templates, can be configured for the following Harmonised Progress steps:\n\nConfirmed by merchant,\nSubmitted to carrier,\nDelivered to pickup point,\nDelivered to consumer,\nTerminated (a delivery that couldn't be completed),\nSent back (parcels being passively returned to the sender, e.g. parcel not picked up in time from the pickup location).\n\n\n\nIngrid Default Logic and Event based Notifications\nComplementary to the progress notifications templates, Ingrid Default Notifications come with a Pickup Reminder logic-based notification. This serves as an SMS reminder, triggered after a configurable amount of time (expressed in hours) if the parcel was not collected from a pickup location by the End Customer.\nBranding and Customization\nThe content of Ingrid's Default Notifications is non-customizable, with the exception of two elements: brand logo included in email templates and a tracking URL which is included in both email and text templates.\nFor Default Emails, the logo you choose must be in .png format and will be positioned prominently in the top left corner of the notification templates. It's important to note that these notifications offer both Light and Dark Mode display options. The chosen display mode (Light or Dark) may affect how the logo itself is presented within the notification.\n\nBy default, all of the Ingrid Default Notifications contain a tracking URL, pointing to the Ingrid Tracking Page in it's tokenized version. This URL can be changed to point to a different tracking page, e.g. to the Merchant's subdomain where the Ingrid Delivery Tracking Widget is embedded.\n\nApart from the notifications content, Ingrid's email and SMS channels allow for the Sender Name configuration, the value appearing as the \"From\" field of the email or the sender information on the SMS message. When the Sender Name is not defined, the field's value will default to the site name.\nSender Name limitations\nWhen choosing a Sender Name for SMS notifications keep the length between 3 to 15 characters and use only A-Z, a-z and 0-9 characters. Sender Name cannot start with a number.\n\nNotifications Locale\nIngrid Delivery Notifications system employs a straightforward logic to determine the language for a default notification.\nThe approach leverages the checkout session locale, which corresponds to the language chosen by the customer during the checkout process. However, if the checkout session information is unavailable (for instance, when an order originated outside the Ingrid system and is registered using the createTrackingOrder endpoint), Ingrid switches to a secondary method. In this case, the notification language is determined based on the destination country specified for the order. This ensures clear and relevant communication regardless of the order placement method.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nIngrid Default Progress Notifications\n\nIngrid Default Logic and Event based Notifications\n\nBranding and Customization\n\nNotifications Locale\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4990,"endCharIdx":10170,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZZLtcZEN8w06H6ljvoM1QDdgmpnsKw5sylDNMb6WYTs="},"3742f15e-586e-4753-80a2-5124356bf80c":{"id_":"3742f15e-586e-4753-80a2-5124356bf80c","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/flow"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ae02f276-8aba-401b-9d83-0b5912bec093","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/flow"},"hash":"Gs4ksxzkLJWwg7t6W5b7UdumQ1b6lkbG84ooXRgHA9Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d9e54408-b4e6-443c-8ffb-7b403d14ea53","metadata":{},"hash":"BKitHRo+DDuG3R6LtnlVC12PQuoNzg2B/TuqKQ9K95Q="}},"text":"Prebooking flow | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

prebooking mechanism flow.\nAfter getting familiar with this section, you will:\n\ngain an understanding of what the prebooking is,\nlearn which problems it solves and when it can be applied,\nfamiliarize yourself with general prebooking mechanism and how it works.\n\nThe big picture\nPicture yourself as a customer of an online shop operated by your favourite merchant. You decide to buy the offered goods and click the payment button to finalize your order - you pay for your order and find yourself on the order summary page soon after. But the journey of your ordered goods has just begun.\nDisclaimer\nThe following story does not reflect the true complexity of fulfilment process. It was simplified to instill an understanding of the problem space and introduce the concept of prebooking without the unnecessary cognitive load. ✨\n\nThis journey may span over couple of complex business processes, one of which is booking the delivery with the carrier of your choice. Booking indicates the readiness of shop to pass your package over to carrier, so that it gets delivered to your address. But how much time has passed between you converting (e-commerce nomenclature for finalizing your order) and the shop doing the actual booking of your package with a carrier?\nAs a customer, you probably want the answer to this question to be \"hopefully not much time\". Your carrier of choice won't know it as well, because it will get the information about the delivery the moment the shop books a delivery. However, the answer to this question can be vital from carrier standpoint, which in turn will make the delivery time as short as possible for you, the customer.\nThe carrier would be able to optimize its resources and prepare, knowing that the order has been made, but the package is not ready to be picked up yet. Uncertainty about packages can lead to longer delivery times when the carrier's resources are overloaded, be it parcel lockers or trucks. The answer to this problem is the prebooking.\nPrebooking mechanism\nPrebooking is the Ingrid service for informing the carrier about all the e-commerce carts that should be booked with the carrier (while it is not a promise). As a carrier if you want to optimize your resources planning, Ingrid prebooking gives great insights based on all merchants orders going through Ingrid Checkout.\nFrom the technical standpoint, the prebooking action is a callback to carrier API endpoint, emitted the moment that customer converts and finalizes the order. It shortens the information feedback loop about incoming packages that will be booked later by the merchant. Detailed description of webhook mechanism used for prebooking and exact message format can be found in the integration guide.\nLive React examples\nWe provide free tier of prebooking service with generous number of prebooking callbacks to carrier API per month.

Request that completes the checkout session is sent to Ingrid Delivery Checkout API with additional order information (like e-mail address and phone number) and then a webhook towards carrier API is fired.\nThe webhook carries over the information about the order, such as customer information, delivery promises and addresses taking part in the delivery process (like warehouse address and delivery address).\nRight now you should be familiar with prebooking concept. If you want to learn more about integrating prebooking into your system, go to the integration guide.\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":5566,"endCharIdx":10849,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"n/SXa2PNZlMFfvuKXbSVSmu6QP3w5jNXYeYrYUZvK1E="},"46e571d6-006e-4af2-b099-a815afe0be5e":{"id_":"46e571d6-006e-4af2-b099-a815afe0be5e","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/flow"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ae02f276-8aba-401b-9d83-0b5912bec093","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/flow"},"hash":"Gs4ksxzkLJWwg7t6W5b7UdumQ1b6lkbG84ooXRgHA9Q="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5ee858f5-cbe0-4d14-a7c3-c0537b95d897","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/prebooking/flow"},"hash":"8rBp+4eI5YvytEwgx20utI3hetuhyEyjGyxf9tD5U7g="}},"text":"On page\n\n\nThe big picture\n\nPrebooking mechanism\n\nUse cases\n\nFlow\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":10842,"endCharIdx":10962,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"JolDkSrg4pcMLy23oFzoBW8wGeUmA3M0Y9YY5D9OWJM="},"db097c89-aa5d-4100-b3b3-3d822476b2da":{"id_":"db097c89-aa5d-4100-b3b3-3d822476b2da","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/react_example"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"4c66ce2c-0ee4-4805-8aee-09859842565d","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/react_example"},"hash":"ZSlJ6Q7Tt20vhV+7BPcv+Yi9BwTT1W2qNqbLZJTt3EA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"37b83f91-bf57-4daf-8066-b5b9027ca67b","metadata":{},"hash":"QMuFReRKjniFn7CmpVAqwt9q950yzLxGpWWXm83nxsc="}},"text":"React Example | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

It can be displayed in two modes:\n\nSearch mode allows all customers to search tracking details for each of their orders\nPrivate mode allows the customer to view the tracking details of a particular order\n\nTracking details and history are presented in a clear and consistent manner. Preview for all deliveries is standardized into harmonised progress.\n\nIngrid Delivery Tracking Page\nIngrid offers also an alternative solution for displaying tracking information to the Customers. Instead of a Tracking Widget embedded on the Merchant’s site, tracking details are accessible on a Tracking Page on Ingrid Tracking Portal.\nIngrid Delivery Tracking API\nDelivery Tracking API together with Events Gateway API are a set of API endpoints developed to enhance and supplement the Tracking Experience.\nCreateTrackingOrder allows for provision of information about orders which originated solely in an external system and tracking such orders using Ingrid Delivery Tracking.\nPublishOrderEvent allows for sending of order-level updates, before parcel leaves Merchant's warehouse.\nRegisterTrackingNumber allows for provision of Tracking Numbers booked outside Ingrid System.\nGetTrackingParcels returns the current tracking status of parcels that can be used for custom integrations.\nGetTrackingOrders returns a list of orders placed by a particular Customer.\nGenerateTrackingPageLink returns a direct url to Ingrid Delivery Tracking Page.\nIngrid Delivery Tracking Notifications\nTracking Notifications are a service that builds on Ingrid Delivery Tracking.\nThe service offers channels to proactively communicate with Customers about the updates and the progress of their delivery, and can also be used with external emailing services and customer data platforms.\nTo enable Tracking Notifications and decide which channels and scenarios to use, please contact the Ingrid Support Team.\nSounds good, where to go next?\n\nTracking Features will provide you with an in-depth summary of the features characterising Ingrid Delivery Tracking,\nProviding Tracking Data will guide you through what needs to be secured before the best Delivery Experience is served to the End Customers\nIntegration Guide will help you navigate the technical part of the selected Ingrid Delivery Tracking integration\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nIngrid Delivery Tracking Widget\n\nIngrid Delivery Tracking Page\n\nIngrid Delivery Tracking API\n\nIngrid Delivery Tracking Notifications\n\nSounds good, where to go next?\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4970,"endCharIdx":9680,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"a7ZgJxfaQETNyMvceVcP1SDc/yLiuvf7Db3EBat+B20="},"b962e768-2e6d-4a5a-b891-f52d95241cd6":{"id_":"b962e768-2e6d-4a5a-b891-f52d95241cd6","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/supports/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e4bda42c-9fa4-4fef-b262-660ee0834a22","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/supports/"},"hash":"3uC40voqHsm3HE/tOwvcPDG4kjINqiuxMjBGC6+zs3s="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ba24ed57-ab76-4c94-9d31-231e4898e633","metadata":{},"hash":"jFL8BRq2DPehovh+eFQ0+yI8Xo5ssFrvvdW62ddRfgg="}},"text":"Supported browsers and languages | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

We provide you with two environments:\n\nStage - is our staging and testing environment where you do all the testing and developing against\n\nhttps://api-stage.ingrid.com\nSwagger UI\nJSON API\n\n\nProduction - is the production environment that you switch to when it’s time to go live\n\nhttps://api.ingrid.com\nSwagger UI\nJSON API\n\n\n\nNote\nPlease note that we reserve the right to introduce additional fields to our API responses without prior notification. Users are encouraged to regularly check for updates in our documentation for any changes that may impact their integration.\n\nAuthorization\nWhen you register with Ingrid you will receive an API token. This token must be send with every request in the Authorization HTTP header with the Bearer prefix followed by base64 encoded token. Each request to our server will look more or less like:\nRequest\n\n\nPOST /v1/delivery_checkout/session.create HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comContent-Type: application/jsonAccept: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer XXE5ODA0NTU0Y2JmNDRkYjhiYTdhM2NhX2EyZjFiNGE={    }\n\nCopy\n\n\nObservability\nAll Ingrid responses will containt a X-Trace-Id header. In case of any problems or question, providing this value to us will allow us to go back to you with more accurate feedback.\nResponse\n\n\nPOST /v1/delivery_checkout/session.create HTTP/1.1Status-Code: 200 Host: api.ingrid.comContent-Type: application/jsonX-Trace-Id: P20220926140104MYAKATVMYPZT3S9Q{}\n\nCopy\n\n\nClient Generation\nSince Ingrid's API is built on top of OpenAPI specification you can use different tools to auto-generate API clients. Two that we recommend are Autorest that works great if you are on the Dotnet stack and OpenAPI Generator that works great for the rest of the programming languages.\nBelow are two simple examples that you can use as base to generate API clients.\n.NET PHP\n\nUsing Autorest generator to generate a C# client.\n\n$ npm install -g autorest$ curl -o swagger.json https://api.ingrid.com/v1/delivery_checkout/_/swagger.json$ autorest --csharp \\--clear-output-folder \\--input-file=swagger.json \\--override-client-name=SiwClient \\--namespace=Ingrid--add-credentials \\--output-folder=siw\n\nCopy\n\n\nUsing OpenAPI Generator to generate a PHP client.\n\n$ openapi-generator generate \\-i https://api.ingrid.com/v1/delivery_checkout/_/swagger.json \\-g php \\-o siw\n\nCopy\n\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nAuthorization\n\nObservability\n\nClient Generation\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4975,"endCharIdx":9101,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"49lmRqz1GBzm9iOKrBcAcY/qhKmZO71xcskia/hcCBA="},"2f296950-b1f2-4304-a439-899a8ac0c39f":{"id_":"2f296950-b1f2-4304-a439-899a8ac0c39f","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/supports"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"07e0adaa-56b4-4314-b558-b70797ccf51a","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_checkout/supports"},"hash":"YMkBaAtwoBcEa5LuEHt+evyKhdShAsgmBwchWf0M45Y="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2c030dc3-801f-4b6f-b21d-ccf0a0227a50","metadata":{},"hash":"jFL8BRq2DPehovh+eFQ0+yI8Xo5ssFrvvdW62ddRfgg="}},"text":"Supported browsers and languages | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

The Tracking Page URL can be found under the Tracking Widget preview modal.\n\n\nTracking Preview\nTo ensure Delivery Tracking presents proper order details to the End Customer, we recommend trying preview the Tracking Widget/Page with a few test orders before launch day, focusing on the path your data flow follows.\nApart from the Tracking Widget preview available directly from the Tracking Numbers Page, you can use the Tracking Playground in IMP to achieve it. In IMP go to the Tracking Playground page located under the Delivery Tracking section, select the Find tab. Then, using the search form by providing external_id/tracking_number and customer_email, render the Delivery Tracking Widget. Next, confirm that all information (delivery type, delivery address etc.) is in place. At this point, below the Tracking Widget you will additionally find the direct link to Tracking Page rendered in private mode.\n\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nTracking Numbers Page\n\nTracking Preview\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":5004,"endCharIdx":8044,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"meDlBGQtQbxYPMRAMFiMXngz57vEik3E8gtKG7+/6+Q="},"a2891a13-ae99-4b3e-8d07-5a3e5d3ae2aa":{"id_":"a2891a13-ae99-4b3e-8d07-5a3e5d3ae2aa","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/tracking_features/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"fc07ba9d-f438-4e90-a3e4-ec4952ed54f3","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/delivery_tracking/tracking_features/"},"hash":"bhkPBwOUiz4/en/gvd+joDLUdr3V1lxt8//h2Aude0o="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"715519da-24d1-4fd6-87a9-0e14d2e05613","metadata":{},"hash":"hyEO5laXGfEjP4cfsC0eGRENadbJS1r1ZC78RoboBq8="}},"text":"Tracking Features | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

These methods can be used to display the Product Page Widget and allow back and forth communication between widget's iframe and your website.\nUsing addListener, you can register callbacks that will be fired when Product Page Widget emits events.\nAfter you subscribe to events with your callbacks, you can use render method to render an iframe with the widget in a specified container.\nTo see the example integration, jump to Integration example section.\nIntegration steps:\n\n\nEmbed bootstrap script from our CDN stage production.\n\n\nSubscribe to events by calling window._ingridPDPWidgetApi.addListener with chosen event name and provide a callback function.\n\n\nCall window._ingridPDPWidgetApi.render to initialize and display the Product Page Widget. This method takes two argumets, respectively:\n\nthe id attribute of a container, in which the widget will be located\na config object, required to create delivery offering\n\n\n\nImportant notice\nWhen creating a script tag, it is required to add attribute type=\"module\"\n\nAuthorization\nIt is required to specify the token in the auth_token config field used by render method. The token has a pattern of ingrid-http-auth-token:<your_id>. You can obtain your token by reaching out to Ingrid Customer Success Team.\nConfig object\nConfig object consists of required and optional values that could be used for creation of a delivery offering. If the config is invalid, an error event will be sent via addListener callback.\nNote\nTypeScript type definitions for the config object can be found on the bottom of that page\n\nCollecting data\nProduct Page Widget has the possibility to gather analytics data (such as created delivery offerings and their impact on a user's decision on adding item to cart), which then Ingrid will aggregate for you. If you'd like to analytics on, two following steps are required:\n\n\nEnable analytics in Ingrid's system\n\n\nAdd window._ingridPDPWidgetApi.onItemAdded method call when item has been added to the cart.\n\n\nAPI overview\nwindow._ingridPDPWidgetApi object exposes methods listed below:\n\n\nrender(id, config) - used to initialize Product Page Widget. After calling it, an iframe with the widget will be injected into the element with matching id.\n\n\naddListener(event, listener) - available events: ready, error.\n\n\nonItemAdded(sku) - optional method that should be called when the item is added to cart.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4979,"endCharIdx":9086,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"h/jmqM77iaw7YN+02riwmyX77B8RSUslu/yMjyW+cuA="},"a67f5f7d-6a5c-4004-8703-a2ddb2cc1fb2":{"id_":"a67f5f7d-6a5c-4004-8703-a2ddb2cc1fb2","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/product_page/integration/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0b5b98c0-58ca-4645-b977-f783c8d0057d","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/product_page/integration/"},"hash":"AyspIO5IXtqbb3PLokKPr09rgSoCzgwYY+eIucvk6jw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1805e1c0-0502-438c-9358-2e5c53cd6fa7","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/product_page/integration/"},"hash":"9uQX7CQjaXb2irUNvHcr4kB3xVdhXQ9fPkceyI2yd0Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"58c03804-080a-4689-ad53-136ecffb1c04","metadata":{},"hash":"du5iR4+AL9ApiOTJmYj8mSKRXm/3vPVgYkHso9wwjyg="}},"text":"Enable analytics in Ingrid's system\n\n\nAdd window._ingridPDPWidgetApi.onItemAdded method call when item has been added to the cart.\n\n\nAPI overview\nwindow._ingridPDPWidgetApi object exposes methods listed below:\n\n\nrender(id, config) - used to initialize Product Page Widget.

As an integrator you will provide information shipment data to the platform. You will also receive information back to your systems when different events occur, i.e. a parcel has been delivered. Ingrid will provide you with the necessary credentials to connect to the platform.\nThese are the steps involved in a typical delivery journey\nWhen the carrier receives a shipment booking, the carrier pre-advice the platform with shipment data.\nThe parcel is arrival scanned at the store and the platform notifies the carrier that a parcel has been received and is ready to be picked up by consumer\nThe carrier notifies the consumer that the parcel is ready to be picked up\nThe consumer identifies themselves with a pre-authenticated QR code or an identity document. The platform requests validation from the carrier. If everything is ok, the parcel is handed out to the consumer.\nThe platform notifies the carrier that the parcel has been delivered.\nSequence diagrams\nPre Advise\nService Point / LockerIngrid PCPCarrierService Point / LockerIngrid PCPCarrierUpsertParcelUpsertParcel\nIngestion\nCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / LockerCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / Lockeralt[Pre advised parcelnot found]Scan codeQuery(code)Search pre-advised parcelQuery(code)Parcel dataParcel dataAccept parcelIngested(parcel)Ingested(parcel)Notify recipient\nDelivery\nCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / LockerCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / Lockeralt[Parcel accpeted byrecipient][Parcle refused bycustomer]Scan receive codeQuery(receive code)Query(receive code)OKOKHand out parcelDeliveredDeliveredRefused reasonRefused reason\n1st mile (Send / Customer return)\nCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / LockerCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / LockerScan drop off codeQuery(code)Query(code)Parcel dataParcel dataAccept parcelAccepted(parcel)Accepted(parcel)\nOverdue returns\nCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / LockerCarrierIngrid PCPService Point / Lockerloop[Loop over returns]List pending returnsHandleReturns(tracking numbers)/parcel/returnedParcel dataParcel data\nAPI\nIn-Store side endpoints\nUpsert parcel 🔗\nPre-advise parcel or to update already stored parcel/ For Ingrid to work as efficiently as possible it is required by the carrier to keep the In-Store system up-to-date with current parcel information. This includes pre-advicing parcel, that is, provide information about parcels which has been booked for a certain location. It also includes updating parcels already at location, i.e. if a parcel should be recalled to the merchant ahead of time.\nCarrier side endpoints\nQuery a parcel\nQuery parcel by a given code.

The time data provided is indicative and should not be used as a basis but as a reference for time estimation. It should be remembered that the execution time of individual steps depends individually on the carrier and the complexity of its system as well as the possibility of adapting it to the needs of the Public Carrier Protocol.\n\nProcess\n\n1. Implementation of the PCP server and client on the carrier's side.\nThis step involves the carrier performing the pre-advise flow for the client and the server for handling events such as Ingestion, delivery or return of the parcel. Implementation must be performed in accordance with the provided interface documentation. To facilitate the implementation, the carrier receives access to the stage environment and the ability to test individual flows in cooperation with QA Ingrid.\n\n2. First tests after implementation\nIn this step, the In-Store team, in close cooperation with the carrier, thoroughly tests the integration. It is tested (depends on carrier):\n\nParcel ingestion to the rack and delivery without ID check\nParcel ingestion to the rack and delivery with ID check\nParcel ingestion to the rack and overdue (passive return)\nCustomer return to the service desk\nParcel ingestion to the locker and delivery without ID check\nParcel ingestion to the locker and delivery with ID check\nParcel ingestion to the locker and overdue (passive return)\nCustomer return to the locker\n\n\n3. Implementation of corrections of inconsistencies detected during testing.\nIn this step, the carrier makes corrections to its integration in order to eliminate issues detected during the tests.\n\n4. Regression tests\nThis is the decisive step to complete the integration with the new carrier. The same tests are performed as in the case of step 2. If errors are detected, step 3 is repeated and step 4 is repeated until all errors encountered are eliminated.\nTimeline\n\n1. Implementation made by the carrier\nBased on previous experience the carrier needs a minimum of 30 business days to complete the first integration. This can however vary greatly depending on previously existing system support on the carrier side.\n\n2. Tests after implementation\nTesting the full flow and reporting issues for the first time takes about 7 business days\n\n3. Implementation of fixes for detected problems\nThe carrier can make the necessary corrections within 10 working days. This time may be extended depending on the complexity of the carrier's manufacturing processes\n\n4. Regression tests\nRegression tests take about 5 working days.\n30   business   daysImplementationmade   by   the   carrier7   business   daysTests   afterimplementation10   business   daysImplementation   offixes   for   detectedproblems5   business   daysRegression   tests\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nProcess\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4979,"endCharIdx":9595,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZUc3ffsqv3ZUh5TiX6IGbyD7cr7xsUlLWKd+YpPnUz8="},"d6fb8e53-5cd9-4aab-9662-75aed039060a":{"id_":"d6fb8e53-5cd9-4aab-9662-75aed039060a","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/som"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"e1da03ee-f0b0-4637-bebc-fa0dd78d466b","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/som"},"hash":"3gJzPmXaWwxDWT8FtX1baT4/hwMV8A8rMaMMOjcz5UM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d9ccbaee-fae9-4dca-a704-17d60f143543","metadata":{},"hash":"3vjjvvL/LgRxxiaDkSoQOt4S8IkeLpPwoPaOIgwahh4="}},"text":"Overview | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.

It covers only details relevant to the users of this feature.\nStep 1: session.create or session.get\nCreate one session per every widget using snippet_configuration top-level field of session.create payload:\n\n  \"snippet_configuration\": {    \"container_id\": \"string\",    \"object_id\": \"string\"  }\n\nCopy\ncontainer_id - HTML element ID assigned to widget's container element. Default value is shipwallet-container . It can be used to add CSS to widget's container.\nobject_id - ID of the widget instance, used to differentiate between widgets simultaneously loaded in the user's browser. If widget's API (i.e. suspend and resume methods) are used, object_id is used to specify target widget. Default value is _sw.\nDuplicate ids\nMake sure to choose unique container_id for each widget, it is required for widgets to work properly. If you are using shipwallet-container id on any element on your page, then pass custom container_id in snippet configuration to prevent id collision.\n\nRequest\n\nRequest\n\nPOST /v1/siw/session.create HTTP/1.1Host: api.ingrid.comAccept: application/jsonContent-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer base64-encoded-api-token{  \"purchase_country\": \"SE\",  \"purchase_currency\": \"SEK\",  \"locales\": [    \"sv-SE\"  ],  \"search_address\": {    \"postal_code\": \"11239\",    \"country\": \"SE\"  },  \"cart\": {    \"total_value\": 129900,    \"currency\": \"SEK\",    \"items\": [      {        \"sku\": \"SKU12345\",        \"name\": \"Saucony Shadow 6000\",        \"quantity\": 1,        \"attributes\": [          \"shoes\",          \"indigo\",          \"class_one\"        ]      }    ]  },  \"snippet_configuration\": {    \"container_id\": \"widget-container-1\",    \"object_id\": \"widget_1\",  }}\n\nCopy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4978,"endCharIdx":8356,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IX29aO4RxjtRYF2qUXh4bLKY0X4I5gvs2On2vcxNEt8="},"7a8bc9f5-c94a-49be-b473-e36e1bdf06c5":{"id_":"7a8bc9f5-c94a-49be-b473-e36e1bdf06c5","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/multiple_widgets/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5ed473fe-c59d-4edc-ae90-564d2c5991a9","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/multiple_widgets/"},"hash":"+ah9Xmi/T/W4UbIV5M4v5gZjFW0om4naFVnx8Ip1JQQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"578dd0a6-474d-4b15-8c2f-1b784eb10101","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/siw/multiple_widgets/"},"hash":"eL/ZndYMPpETJmJPN2BJI0ah1u7ruLsXw/N5kq9IQ5w="}},"text":"Uniqueness of object_id and container_id\nobject_id does not have to be globally unique. object_id must only be unique in browser context of a given user. Example: user A goes to checkout with two orders from different vendors in his cart, so they get to see two widgets, one is widget_1, the other is widget_2 . The second one can have any object_id other than widget_1 . User B (different machine and browser context) goes to checkout and also has two widgets, widget_1 and widget_2.\ncontainer_id is an HTML element ID and therefore there cannot be two same IDs in one HTML page, otherwise it's not valid HTML.\nsession.get\nsession.get does not accept snippet_configuration, instead session remembers the configuration it has been created with and session.get will return html_snippet with previous object_id and container_id.\nHowever, it is not straightforward to extract container_id and object_id from html_snippet. Instead, snippet_configuration should be saved and kept track of, just like session_id. For example, if session_id is kept in cart object, then snippet_configuration can also be kept there.\nStep 2: embed html_snippets to render multiple widgets\nRendering one or more widgets works the same way. Embed html_snippets returned from session.create or session.get in your checkout page.\nThe snippet_configuration is reflected in the html_snippet:\n\n<div id=\"{% container_id %}\">  <script>    (function(window, objectId, containerId, document) {      ...    })(window, {% object_id %}, {% container_id %}, document);  </script></div>\n\nCopy\nStep 3: (optional) suspend/resume\nEach widget instance gets its own global variable in the browser's context named after its object_id . For object_id == \"widget_1\" , the variable will be named widget_1 and thus will be accessible as window.widget_1 or window[\"widget_1\"] . So call to suspend would look like this:\n\nwindow[\"widget_1\"]((api) => api.suspend());\n\nCopy\n\nLast updated: Tue, Nov 19, 06:15 AM\n\n\nOn page\n\n\nRequest\n\nUniqueness of object_id and container_id\n\nsession.get\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ingrid, All rights reserved\n\nPrivacy Policy","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":8359,"endCharIdx":10444,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"f/ZaOEag2TewXkjVrxpWk0n2ggWAb7NzV33xqOWMFEk="},"0daabc6d-250c-495b-9170-e2cb77a8e7bd":{"id_":"0daabc6d-250c-495b-9170-e2cb77a8e7bd","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/introduction/supported_carrier_products.html"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"57086260-a447-4968-980d-c9bf0a003b41","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.ingrid.com/introduction/supported_carrier_products.html"},"hash":"4CMuj/Ij8qvfIdJiGca7er0L4eQaZNxUT7xyV8VZajU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4fd95c3e-5358-42b3-8001-cd82c94796ac","metadata":{},"hash":"ZAAtPq/Kugee9NjGEqQHs0OB0Slq+eBaOv4gliLKnEU="}},"text":"404 | Ingrid Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou control your data\nWe and our business partners use technologies, including cookies, to collect information about you for various purposes, including:\n\nFunctional\n\nBy clicking ‘Accept’, you give your consent for all these purposes.
