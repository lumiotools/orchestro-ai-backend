Route WEBHOOKsBack to bettermile.com Nothing Found Back to bettermile.comBettermileBetter PlacesData GatewayBetter RouteIntroductionBetter Route Driver AppBetter Route APIBetter Route WebhooksBetter TrackingLast updated 7 months agoBetter Route WEBHOOKs\nUsing Bettermile Webhooks for real-time updates\nListen for events on your Bettermile tours, so your integration can automatically trigger reactions in your system. \nThe Bettermile Webhook API provides a way for Bettermile tenants to interact programmatically with Bettermile by subscribing to important events of your tours. Bettermile will notify your application whenever an important event happens.\nNote: For tour set up and tour interaction processes via your backend, we recommend an integration of the Better Route API or the use of the Bettermile Driver App.\nHow does it work?\nWhen your application endpoint is enabled on Bettermile to receive events, Bettermile will push real-time notifications to it. These notifications contain the type of event, such as updates to sequences on tours. On your side, you can then use that to integrate Bettermile with existing or new software.\nGetting started with the Bettermile Webhook API\nPreparing to receive a Webhook Notifications\nAs prerequisite of Bettermile enabling to send you Webhook notifications, you must make sure you are prepared to receive them:\n\n\nYou will need to implement an HTTPS endpoint to receive POST requests as a JSON payload that include the event objects. (please share the endpoint URL with the Bettermile team)\n\n\nFor each request received from Bettermile, your endpoint needs to answer with a 2xx status code.\n\n\nBettermile will not transfer any data on unsafe connections. So please, ensure your created endpoint is both public, and can handle HTTPS connections. We accept endpoints with self-signed keys. (To be provided by you.)\n\n\nEvent types\nYou should only get from the events you receive the important fields for your logic to work. You also should ignore any events not important for your use case. Parsing or checking the data on fields and events you don't need may put undue stress on your side.\nDelivery attempts\nIf your endpoint is down or not responding with a 2xx code, Bettermile will keep retrying the delivery of the messages by around an hour. The retries have an exponential backoff independent for each message.\nAfter the 1-hour period is over, Bettermile will stop trying to deliver the message and discard it. Due to the fast nature of delivery events we consider 1 hour to be enough time for the message to still be relevant and be retried.\nHandling the Events\nDue to the distributed nature of our internal systems, there may be some edge cases happening.\nOut Of Order Delivery\nThe delivery of the messages to your endpoint may come out of order from the actual order the events themselves occurred. If ordering is important for your internal systems, you should set up a system to handle this case. We strongly recommend you don't do that though. It may put undue strain on your systems to order the messages you receive. We recommend you project a system as stateless as possible to prevent unforeseen edge-cases.\nDuplicate Delivery\nSome messages may be delivered more than once, though rare, this can happen. Thus, we recommend your systems are able to handle the received messages in an idempotent manner. One way to do this is storing the events you received and if you receive one that is already stored, you may discard it and answer with a 2xx code.\nSecure connections\nBettermile will outright refuse any non-encrypted connection. So be sure that HTTPS is enabled on your endpoint, even if with a self-signed key.\nRedirects and other HTTP statuses\nBettermile will consider any status different from 2xx statutes an error. This also means Bettermile will not follow any redirects, considering a redirect status an error, and will keep retrying until the status is 2xx or the retry window expires. \nWebhook Events\nThis document describes the common message structure all the Bettermile's webhook events share. \nThe message body\nAny messages sent by Bettermile will have the following structure:\nƬ EventSchema: Object\nExample\n\n\nCopy\nCopied\n\n{\n    \"version\":\"0\",\n    \"id\":\"2a4650b3-e231-dc1b-2046-c7beb1ada720\",\n    \"time\":\"2023-10-05T09:47:07Z\",\n    \"source\":\"better_route\",\n    \"detail-type\":\"SEQUENCE_CHANGED\",\n    \"detail\":   {\n                \"data based on the event type\"\n                }\n}\n\nType declaration\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nversion\nThe version for this event.

connector\" component,\nthat gathers all relevant information from the tenant's system landscape and sends it to the Bettermile system:\n\n\n\n\nIn \"Connector Design\", the whole process of data transmission from tenant to Bettermile is\nexplained at high level.\nBetter Route accepts input files to import address data (also referred to as \"master data\"), assignments\n(data assigned to users, vehicles, etc.) and status updates (changes in the status, e.g. a parcel was delivered to the\ncustomer).\nIn \"Upload to AWS S3\" you can find the technical details of the file upload process.\nIn Data & Delivery Format, the details of these import files are explained, as they must be\nin a specified JSON format.CompanyAboutCareersLegalPrivacy PolicyLegal Notice© Bettermile 2024

TrackingLast updated 3 weeks agoWelcome to Better RouteCouriers and express parcel experts require a state-of-the-art route optimization to compete in a disruptive field. Better Route helps them stay ahead of the pack, and unexpected changes on the tour, thanks to multi-constraint route optimization and dynamic updates all put together in a powerful stateful tour backend.At Bettermile we understand our customers have different abilities and needs, hence we offer most of our product in a modular approach. This can range from you onboarding on all of our products (We offer packages with hardware includes, as well as you deciding on the device the driverapp needs to run on) to you integrating the parts (e.g. the Better Route API to power you own driver app or just the delivery optimized Navigation SDK integration), that you need to allow your drivers to make the most out of their delivery job while you keeping full control on the way.The Better Route optimization engine solves the classical travelling salesman problem dynamically - in specific with the objective to minimize time spent on the route. The tour set up and ETAs will furthermore take into consideration limitations such as timeframes or customizable delivery zones on jobs - and this not only once a day, but as many times as needed for driver and consignee.Better Route is designed to answer quite a diverse variation of last-mile complexities - next to 150+ stops per tour it factors in basic (e.g. avoiding left turns) and advance (e.g. delivery windows) obstacles to generate the very best sequence from/to any point within the tour. In interaction with delivery (or pickup) updates this makes a full stateful tour backend, that additionally allows frequent updates on ETAs.The Better Route API accelerates tours right from the start in sorting and loading. In the warehouse, drivers can simply scan parcels to get sorting and loading tips that translate to maximum delivery efficiency along every route.We - as Bettermile - use our stateful tour backend too for our Bettermile driver App, giving us not only very useful insights on driver's, but also being able to cater to developer needs. As data ingestion hub underneath, we make use of the Bettermile DataGateway, allowing a streamlined data, but also custom adjustments towards tenant's operational needs.CompanyAboutCareersLegalPrivacy PolicyLegal Notice© Bettermile 2024 Empowering last mile delivery","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":2650,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mxPsMIlKtEj3J5287LsQF74xkebjd+3uKrU7FZF1f3I="},"f85dd11e-6d01-40ce-a351-4191ee4c6679":{"id_":"f85dd11e-6d01-40ce-a351-4191ee4c6679","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/rtt/rttintroduction"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"b944809c-86e6-47aa-97e4-e9369f40e0a7","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/rtt/rttintroduction"},"hash":"S7HHlbkYlbHStIgLHKBFQBkBJtWYEMs43Mqf0pZZd9E="}},"text":"Bettermile Developer PortalBack to bettermile.com Nothing Found Back to bettermile.comBettermileBetter PlacesData GatewayBetter RouteBetter TrackingIntroductionBetter Tracking APIRealtime Tracking APIBetter Tracking WidgetLast updated 2 years agoBetter Tracking APIThe Better Tracking API enables you to create your individual tracking experiences for tours driven with Better Route.The Better Tracking Stack uses the same proven and established rule sets to prevent users from being informed wrongly about the Estimated arrival of parcels or any other goods.

This page discusses when the tenant's\nconnector logic should transmit which fragment of a job to the Bettermile Data Gateway (DGW).\nTypical phases of data transmission\n\n\n“Master Data” for a delivery or pickup becomes available in the tenant's core system, typically when a label is digitally generated and a unique identifier is assigned. This is the earliest possible point in time to send initial job data as pre-advice information. Crucial properties like contact.address should be defined, but also other information like services or contact.timeFrames can be sent with the pre-advice data. Bettermile stores pre-advice/master data for up to 30 days, to be combined with assignment data sent on the actual day of delivery or pickup.\n\n\nAssignments of jobs to a specific driver or route become final. This typically happens in the destination depot while the driver is loading and scans the parcels for manifest or verification purpose. We recommend to send the assignment data with low latency to the Bettermile DGW, because the driver is about to start his tour and wants to log on to Bettermile App and requests an initial sequence calculation. At this point in time these aspects are crucial:\n\n\nEnsure master data has been provided for each assigned job id. If the master data has changed since the (optional) pre-advice transmission, an update must be sent together with the assignment. If there was no pre-advice transmission of this job beforehand, it must be sent now together with the assignment data.\n\n\nThe delivery assignments the tenant connector transmits should reflect exactly what the driver has loaded into his delivery vehicle. Otherwise the drivers' waypoint sequence will be inconsistent with the jobs/tasks to perform. If drivers of different routes exchanges parcels last minute, the tenant system and connector must transmit an update of the assignment immediately. The delivery will be assigned to the driver/route with the latest “created” timestamp. It is also possible to simply revoke an assignment by sending an unassignment.\n\n\nPickup assignments should be transmitted as well, before the driver loads the initial Better Route sequence for his tour/route in order to consider those jobs in the initial sequence optimization.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the driver left the depot and started driving according to the optimised sequence of Better Route waypoints, the connector will typically send this information:\n\n\nStatusChanges: confirmation from the tenant's core system that a job/task has been completed. For the best user experience, the status change data should be transmitted with the shortest possible latency.\n\n\nAdditional pickup assignments (with job master data included). These new pickup locations will be added at an appropriate position to the existing drivers sequence.\n\n\n\n\nThe details of the connector processes need to be considered for each tenant individually, since the IT core system or even the operational processes are different in each country.\nTypical Connector Process Setups\nSimple setup\nThis is the minimum required setup in order to be able to use Bettermile products with a tenant's core system. It is suitable as a first step in an integration pilot. The concept of the simple setup is to deliver the minimal required parcel data in one phase, shortly before the data is required by Better Route, when a driver requests the initial sequence for his route. This ensures that data is transferred by the connector as “up to date” as it can be. The data is typically taken from a drivers manifest, when the manifest is being closed or from a loading/verification scan by the driver, before she starts the delivery tour.\nFull dynamic setup\nThis setup is required for tenants with high parcel volumes and advanced feature support. The job data needs to be processed and transferred in three phases / processes as outlined above:\n\n\nThe pre-advice process needs to send all the master data as in the simple setup (without the assignment information). This can be as early as the parcels label or ID is created (e.g. for a pickup) or when the parcels are physically scanned for the first time by the tenant's system. The latest point in time is about 2 hours before the assignment process typically starts. The connector needs to track the last modification timestamp of a jobs source data record and transmit an update job object to DGW, whenever the source data changes. This is true until a job is flagged as done in the tenant's system (see phase 3).","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4928,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"3Mxk4LVz9z/QzZw4d5KHN1/ua9syaRX2yniYt1Pm/YI="},"097a8077-ee08-4f92-a778-4ea4ab8bc49c":{"id_":"097a8077-ee08-4f92-a778-4ea4ab8bc49c","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/dgw/connectordesign"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"61c8f98a-a491-453d-9b95-39399a5eae65","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/dgw/connectordesign"},"hash":"gmkSuTPLOIZdK21WMeLd+Ypv54mTRNAKwI07ArwUxcU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6dfd7ceb-c820-4afd-a03f-38b0a871ab07","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/dgw/connectordesign"},"hash":"eNDAl52XwSdnKj4h5WnJb8mbv5kZFhVTNAA2SYVcz8E="}},"text":"The pre-advice process needs to send all the master data as in the simple setup (without the assignment information).

The connector needs to track the last modification timestamp of a jobs source data record and transmit an update job object to DGW, whenever the source data changes. This is true until a job is flagged as done in the tenant's system (see phase 3).\n\n\nThe actual assignment of a job to a driver/route/vehicle is typically happening after a parcel has been scanned in the destination depot for manifest or “out for delivery” status. When transmitting an assignment to DGW, this connector process must ensure that the master data (phase 1) has been transmitted before. Also, if there was an update of a jobs master data (specifically address data) in the tenant's core system, the connector process has to make sure the latest version is transmitted to DGW. In case the master data is up to date the assignment job fragment looks like this:\n\n\nCopy\nCopied\n\n{\n    \"id\" : \"54365964-xyz\",      // job.id references the jobs  master data\n    \"date\" : \"2021-12-07\",      // actual delivery/pickup date. \"Overwrites\" estimated date send in the master data earlier\n    \"source\" : \"assignment\",    // see D&D description\n    \"depot\" : \"ORC\",            // same depot id as in master data\n    \"assignment\" : {            // the assignment to a specific driver/route/etc\n      \"scantime\" : \"2021-12-06T17:25:51.443-08:00\",\n      \"properties\" : {\n      \"route\" : \"4711\"          // the actual assignment key value pair\n    }\n }\n\n\n\nTransferring status changes for all assigned jobs until a job is done. Bettermile does not require job status changes before a job has an assignment for the current date. This connector process should aim for very low latency.\n\n\nCopy\nCopied\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"54365964-xyz\",\n  \"date\": \"2022-01-08\",\n  \"source\": \"scan\",\n  \"depot\": \"ORC\",\n  \"created\": \"2022-01-08T10:24:40+01:00\",\n  \"statusChanges\": [\n    {\n      \"state\": \"processed\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2022-01-08T10:23:09-08:00\",\n      \"outcome\": \"success\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\nQuestions to be considered in connector process design\nWhile basic mapping of master data might seem trivial, there are a number of more complex aspects to be discussed and decided in the conceptualisation phase:\n\n\nWhat is a suitable ID from the tenant's system to be used as unique job ID?\n\n\nWhich job types are required? (E.g. one or multiple types of pickup/collection).\n\n\nWhat are the appropriate triggers for the connector to send master and assignment data?\n\n\nWhat changes typically occur while the driver is on the delivery tour?\n\n\nWhat might be different for international / import parcels?\n\n\nWhat other tenant-specific edge cases need to be covered by the connector logic?\n\n\nHow to ensure monitoring

Route APIAuthenticationData flows & basic use casesBettermile Tour Commander APIBetter Route WebhooksBetter TrackingLast updated 3 weeks agoBetter Route API - Data Flow & Basic Use CasesData FlowThe Better Route API requires you to set up a basic connector set up upfront - allowing job information to reach Bettermile, so it can be used in then the route optimizations over the day.The Basics - Setting up a tour and generating sequencesOnce the job data for a tour has reached Bettermile in the connector, you can go ahead and create a tour.With this being done you can go ahead and a sequence generation.The sequence generation is recommend for any mode to be requested in at least 10 min intervals - if you have updates in the meanwhile (e.g.a job status update), of course more often is beneficial.The modes allow you to define if the route is follow a custom order of waypoints or if to optimize freely based on current location, the defined destination and start time on the sequence request or if to keep a previously defined order mainly intact.The most used optimization mode is FIXED_OPTIMIZATION as it instructs that ETAs of waypoints to be re-calculated, while the order of the waypoints is mostly kept intact (waypoint may only be moved in certain special cases, like when the timeframe changes for a waypoint).Talk to us if you want to learn more on the basics.Happy to have a chat!Cater to specific drivers needs (and habits)We are aware every delivery tour is a bit different while still following basic delivery standards.Drivers have habits (and this is totally ok).Bettermile is there to support these needs.Selecting the first waypointThe driver preferring to start their daily tour either in one particular street or in a specific area is something completely normal.This can be reflected with allowing to select the first waypoint when doing the sequence request - you can do this of course also throughout the day if needed.Setting a custom timeframe on a waypointWhile you can also are able to transfer timeframe information on jobs via the connector - there are cases where it may make sense to allow the driver to also set on the waypoint a specific timeframe (e.g.them knowning that this road being not accessible for vehicles after 10:30 am)Adding (& removing) custom jobsWhile we expect most jobs (aka tasks) for the drivers' tour are transmitted via the connector, there may be situations - such as the driver needing to charge vehicle - where he wants this reflected as separate custom jobs.This means the charging spot is reflected and placed in sequences as well as allowing the surrounding waypoints to update accordingly in ETAs.(for the use case of vehicle charging: best to be combined with custom timeframes on waypoints as well as custom stop time)Defining a custom destinationThe common use case is, the driver in the end of the day returning back to the depot.As this is not the case for all drivers on all days, we allow to also define a custom destination, that we then take into account when calculating the Defining custom waypointsIn cases where your driver is in need for a mega stop - so a stop where he then delivers to multiple addresses by foot from one parking spot - define a custom waypoint.It is up to your driver then to define the jobs to do here as well as the address where this should happen.Setting custom stop timesAll waypoints get calculated stop times - reflecting the waypoint itself as well as the jobs to be done here.Some waypoints with e.g.security checks to handle, we can not reflect unless the driver let's us know.For this we allow custom stop time to be set (recommended are 15 min intervals to not overwelm the driver in decision)Checking for recalculation gainWhile on the road the day happens, and once in a while there may be faster options to reach destination.Especially if your driver choose to drive in a fully custom order sequence - in order to make a possible ETA gain visible to him, you can request in intervals recalculation gain potential - so a time the driver could save to destination, if he would request a FULL_OPTIMIZATION mode sequence (later please ofc change then to a FIXED_OPTIMZATION mode one , in order to keep the rest of sequence for the driver intakt).More ideas or questions?We are aware the last mile delivery topic being quite complex, in case of any questions please reach out anytime.We are happy to chat and give more recommendations.Same for any use cases you do not have reflected yet.Please reach out.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"eriDuxWzZuZtH5NeMH4wcj94D/RPeclzxOLsaLWdBzg="},"301ef848-18c2-48d6-8520-ab965af01121":{"id_":"301ef848-18c2-48d6-8520-ab965af01121","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/tcg/basicflowsusecases"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9f3dce83-d962-430b-a313-8e6c80aa5824","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/tcg/basicflowsusecases"},"hash":"Rdg517AhZzGiK+KlRCcnN9m3ikwVK53NgCd2IsAsXH0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0a2341ad-d844-44be-a259-0a8569c31c3a","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/tcg/basicflowsusecases"},"hash":"eriDuxWzZuZtH5NeMH4wcj94D/RPeclzxOLsaLWdBzg="}},"text":"For

Therefore, it is recommended that files adhere to the following naming scheme:\n\n\n<tenant-id>-<data-type>-<depot-id>-<YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS>-<random-alphabetic-letters>.json|gz|zip|tar.gz\n\n\n<tenant-id>\n: a short agreed upon name for the customer/tenant.\n\n\n<data-type>\n: this may be \"master-data\", \"assignment-data\" or \"status-updates\", but this is entirely descriptive and can also be more closely reflecting the actual tenant specific structuring of the data.\n\n\n<depot-id>\n: optional identifier for the depot if something like this exists. This is also only descriptive.\n\n\n<YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS>\n: date and time when this file was generated.\n\n\n<random-alphabetic-letters>\n: to disambiguate files created in the same second.\n\n\n<json|gz|zip|tar.gz>\n: multiple compression options are available. We strongly recommend to compress files, see below. Any file ending other than gz, zip or tar.gz will be treated as plain JSON in UTF-8 encoding.\n\n\n\n\nFile sizes, packaging and compression\nFiles can have any size up to 10 MB. This limit is large enough for all foreseeable needs. Files bigger than the upper limit will be ignored instead of being imported.\nFiles should ideally be not too small. E.g. they should not just contain data from one driver or vehicle but from as many as possible of them.\nA file may contain address, assignment and status update data all in one, or the different data types can be split into different kinds of file.\nThe content must be valid JSON conforming to the Data & Delivery schema and encoded in UTF-8.\nEach object can be inside a top level array or concatenated next to each other.\nWe strongly recommend to compress the files either as:\n\n\ngz: Gzip compressed files (the preferred choice)\n\n\ntar.gz: compressed tar archive with just a single file entry (only the first one will be processed)\n\n\nzip: compressed file in zip format with just a single file entry (only the first one will be processed)\n\n\nStatus update files can be sent in regular intervals (for instance one per minute). Ideally only one file at a time, but may also be split into multiple files for each depot or depot group.\nUploading files to AWS S3\nBettermile will provide the following to the tenant:\n\n\nAWS S3 bucket\n: an S3 bucket identified by a unique URL for the respective tenant.\n\n\nAWS Console Login URL\n: a URL for logging into the AWS console, to generate access key ID and secret access key.\n\n\nAWS username\n: username for AWS console log in.\n\n\nTemporary Password\n: a one-time password for logging into the AWS console, that the tenant will be requested to change after the first login.\n\n\nThe tenant will be able to put, list and read files in its bucket. Only the tenant and the Bettermile division will be\nable to access the S3 bucket. The tenant will not be able to navigate to this bucket from the AWS console, due to strict\npermission, they can however access the AWS console bucket page from its URL.\nThere are multiple ways to upload files to AWS S3. It can be done on the command line, with a REST API or using\nthe various AWS SDKs targeting different programming environments:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html\nUpload via AWS Console:\n\n\nSign in to AWS console\n\n\nAccess the bucket by URL: \nhttps://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/<bm-route-dgw-sample-bucket-name>\n\n\nUpload files manually with the \"Upload\" button.\n\n\nUpload via CLI / Terminal:\n\n\nInstall AWS CLI\n.\n\n\nSet up your AWS credentials\n with \naws configure\n.\n\n\nUpload files to S3: \naws s3 cp <PATH_TO_FILES> s3://<BUCKET_NAME>\n.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4341,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"s+7iPaNA328iwVSqpplMxlR7vjb7RTprNwymyp6uzo8="},"803b67b8-bd15-4607-827d-2a881858ea32":{"id_":"803b67b8-bd15-4607-827d-2a881858ea32","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/dgw/uploadtoawss3"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0a814a77-ebad-4ecf-9b7b-4183cd60c2f9","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/dgw/uploadtoawss3"},"hash":"HzKF8W8J5TopUKoDllj11WF3Pb61u720+9TD9A5BfCA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c78341b6-a6eb-4b3b-8e53-7e797a6d78f3","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.bettermile.com/static/pages/dgw/uploadtoawss3"},"hash":"MFZqiLabqd8rsmPbFHLMxaWGJXljd+vx35GHS8I9ykk="}},"text":"Sign in to AWS console\n\n\nAccess the bucket by URL: \nhttps://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/<bm-route-dgw-sample-bucket-name>\n\n\nUpload files manually with the \"Upload\" button.\n\n\nUpload via CLI / Terminal:\n\n\nInstall AWS CLI\n.\n\n\nSet up your AWS credentials\n with \naws configure\n.\n\n\nUpload files to S3: \naws s3 cp <PATH_TO_FILES> s3://<BUCKET_NAME>\n.\n\n\nHow to create AWS access key ID and secret access key\nTenants will receive the following from Bettermile:\n\n\nAWS Console Login URL\n\n\nAWS username\n\n\nTemporary password\n\n\nStep 1: Login to AWS Console Login URL with provided username and temporary password\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Change Password (only 1st time)\nOnce you log in for the first time, you will be asked to change console password:\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Go to “My Security Credentials”\nAfter logging into the AWS console:\n\n\n\n\nthen:\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create access key\n\n\n\n\nNote: Once the access key is generated, make a note of it or download it as it can not be viewed again.

Drivers using Bettermile App will get an optimized route sequence, routing support (turn by turn navigation), consignee addresses, timeframes and other helpful information. Furthermore, it is a prerequisite for route optimization analysis and monitoring within the Bettermile Backoffice.\nThe top level object in the data format is job, which is an abstraction of a single task a delivery driver has to perform. Currently there are three different types of jobs:\n\n\ndelivery\n - job type for which the consignee-contact will be considered for tour calculation.\n\n\npickup\n - pickup of a specific parcel with an already known parcel id. Shipper-contact will be considered for tour-calculation.\n\n\ncollection\n - collecting an unknown number of parcels at the shipper-contact location (e.g. parcel shop, drop box).\n\n\nAlthough all required information could technically be combined in one single job object, the different aspects typically become available at different points in time in the lifecycle of a parcel. Bettermile considers three phases of data transmission:\n\n\nmaster data\n - job properties that do not change (id, type, depot) or that are unlikely to change (shipper & consignee information) until the job is done. This information can be transmitted to Bettermile as soon as it is available in the tenants IT system. The actual \ndate\n of delivery does not need to be final at this time.\n\n\nassignment data\n - contains assignment information for one \njob\n to a specific driver (or route, vehicle, etc) on a specific \ndate.\n This is required for all jobs designated for a specific driver/route before Better Route is able to calculate optimized sequences and navigation routes for the driver.\n\nThe ultimate goal is that assignments reflect 100% of the parcels physically present in a driver's vehicle when he/she leaves the depot in the morning and logs into Bettermile App.\n\nPlease note that it is quite common that there will be multiple assignments for one job:\n\n\nDrivers trade/swap parcels after the initial assignment was transmitted: in that case the tenant's connector should send a new assignment for the same job id with the new assignment value and a later scan date.\n\n\nA parcel was not delivered today and it will be assigned to the same (or another) driver/route tomorrow: in this case the connector needs to transmit a new assignment for the next day, so that Better Route can include it on a new delivery sequence for the next day.\n\n\n\n\nstatus updates\n - are typically sent after the driver left the depot and a parcel gets a new status (e.g. “delivered”) in the tenants IT systems. Main purpose is to know which jobs need to be considered for tour (re-)calculation and which can be ignored because they are done.\n\n\n General remarks on the format\nBettermile expects that all the data that is required for a certain date is exported daily before any driver activity takes place. The standard delivery mechanism is a periodic upload to an AWS S3 bucket.\nThe data is sent in JSON format as a top level array of elements (preferred) or as concatenated JSON.\nArray example:\n\n\nCopy\nCopied\n\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"dc5a6618-66ac-4128-b198-fabcfca45423\",\n    \"date\": \"2020-01-02\",\n    \"...\": \"...\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"f30f3f1c-2115-4f36-8be3-c0fda62a78aa\",\n    \"date\": \"2020-01-02\",\n    \"...\": \"...\"\n  }\n]\n\nConcatenated JSON (Wikipedia):\n\n\nCopy\nCopied\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"dc5a6618-66ac-4128-b198-fabcfca45423\",\n  \"date\": \"2020-01-02\",\n  \"...\": \"...\"\n}\n{\n  \"id\": \"f30f3f1c-2115-4f36-8be3-c0fda62a78aa\",\n  \"date\": \"2020-01-02\",\n  \"...\": \"...\"\n}\n\nThe encoding of the data must be in UTF-8.\nAdditionally, the data has to be compliant with the JSON schema (see https://json-schema.org/).

A priority group number is used to prestructure the Better Route optimized sequence. First all jobs assigned with the lowest group number will be considered for the Better Route sequence, then all jobs with the next higher group number. Jobs with different priorityGroup will not be combined in one waypoint.If the job also has timeFrames, they can be in conflict with the priorityGroup and might be ignored.\n\n\nassignmentTags\nno\nObject with key-value pairs for optional information on the current assignment properties. These tags are intended solely for informational purposes and do not define or affect the mandatory assignment properties object.\n\n\n\n Assignment Tags\nAssignment tags allow Bettermile to receive custom tenant-specific fields to enrich the required assignment property values. Assignment tags are enabled on a tenant-by-tenant basis and serve complimentary details to various Bettermile platform components such as Route, RTT, and Backoffice on tenant-specific operational contexts surrounding the submitted assignment values.\nAssignment tags have the same lifespan as the parent assignment object: they expire when a new assignment for the Job is received or at midnight local time.\n\n\n\nName\nMandatory\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndriverName\nno\nA string field with the driver's name.
