Below, you will find resource addresses, explanations, and examples showcasing how to use our API to access and manage Jobs, related Actions, and information regarding Itineraries created via Cigo Tracker.\\nOn the right hand side, you can navigate all available resources along with the responses each API endpoint produces.\\nWhat can you do with our API?The Cigo Tracker API enables you to:\\n\\nCreate, retrieve, update and delete Jobs\\nCreate, retrieve, update and delete Actions related to Jobs\\nCreate, retrieve, update and delete Itineraries\\nThis also allows you to dynamically preview potential Itinerary routes, assign operators, vehicles, and change stop positions\\n\\n\\nRetrieve Locations, Vehicles and Operators created within the platform\\n\\nAPI ConnectionsProduction\\nFor API connections in the production environment, specify the URL: https://app.cigotracker.com\\nSandbox (Demo)\\nFor API connections in the sandbox environment, specify the URL: https://app-demo.cigotracker.com\\n Important: Jobs created with a valid email and/or a mobile_number may be notified via Email and SMS to follow their order even in the sandbox environment. In your testing, we recommend only sending notifications to internal recipients.\\nWebhooksAfter enabling the API, you can manage webhooks from the web portal to monitor the following system actions:\\n\\nAll Job status changes\\nIndependent Job status changes: In Progress, Completed, Incomplete, Partially Completed, Damaged, Resolved\\nJob creation, information updates, and assignation to itinerary\\nJob Action creation, information updates (excluding status changes) or deletion via the Operator mobile app\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nAt this time, you cannot manage your webhooks via the API\\nYou must login as the Administrator of the account to enable the API and manage webhooks\\n\\nKey Concepts & FAQThere are some key Cigo concepts to understand in order to easily navigate documentation and use our API.\\nWhat is a Job?\\nA Job is a general term used in Cigo to describe a destination, such as a Customer, where your Operator(s) may do a\\ndelivery, a service call, an installation, or various Job Actions (see explanation on 'Job Action' below).\\nWhen a job is created via the API, its initial status value is staging. If you log in to Cigo, you can find this Job by opening the sidebar menu and navigating the Import Tool page.\\nOnce you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created API records under the 'Review records from API Integration' tab.\\nDispatcher will typically use the Import Tool to validate and review upcoming Jobs prior to dispatching them to vehicles. At a glance, they can validate if the address of each Job will be properly geo-coded and if the address string is valid.\\nHowever, if this step is not needed for your integration, you can skip the Import Tool when the Job is created via the API by setting skip_staging to true (for details, refer to the POST Create a new Job).\\nJob statuses range from:\\n\\nstaging: Jobs created with skip_staging: false (default) will return this status. Jobs in this state cannot be routed and have to be reviewed in the Import Tool.\\nnew: Jobs post-import (or if created via the API with skip_staging: true). This is the base state of a job that can be or has been added to an Itinerary's route.\\nin progress: Once an operator selects 'On Route' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state. If this isn't the first Job in the itinerary, the Job prior must have been started and finished before this status can be set.\\ncompleted: Once an operator selects 'Completed' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state. A job must have been in progress to be transitioned in this state.\\nincomplete: Once an operator selects 'Incomplete' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state. From the Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection. Furthermore, your organization can choose to enforce a report with either images and/or text explanations required for said report. This is managed from the Company Settings page, under the Fulfillment Options section.\\npartially completed: This state is special in the sense that an operator does not directly select it. Instead, a job is transitioned to this state only when an operator has one or many actions marked as either 'Damaged' or 'Incomplete' and chooses the 'Completed' state on the overall job. This results in a job being partially completed.\\ndamaged: Once an operator selects 'Damaged' in the mobile app, and fills out a report, the job will transition to this state. From the Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection.\\nresolved: This status is special. It cannot be set by the operators. Instead it is managed from the web after a job has been transitioned from either incomplete, damaged or partially completed, the status of the job can be transitioned to 'Resolved' by a web user. This can be useful to indicate that a prior mishap has been resolved and that this job no longer requires attention.\\n\\nWhat is a Job Action?\\nA Job can be assigned any number of Actions. These Actions serve as a to-do list for the Operator arriving on site\\n(i.e. a customer's location). Actions have types (i.e. delivery, installation, service, etc.) and other attributes,\\nsuch as handle time (the amount of time the action is estimated to take).\\nJob Action statuses range from:\\n\\nundetermined: No status has been set for this Job Action yet. This is the default state.\\ncompleted: This Job Action has been fulfilled without any issues.\\nincomplete: This Job Action could not be fulfilled.\\ndamaged: An incident is related to this Job Action.\\n\\nHow are Customer profiles created and updated?\\nWhen you create a new Job, an existing Customer profile is either linked or created. Customer profiles are created or updated\\nbased on a Job's first name, last name, phone number, and address fields.\\nWhen you first create a Job, you can assign a Customer Reference ID. When you create new Jobs assigned to the same\\nCustomer Reference ID, it'll keep all of them associated with the same Customer.\\nCan I create or update a Customer profile without creating or updating a Job?\\nNo, you cannot. Within the web interface, there are a few things you can update on an existing Customer profile, but\\nthis is not currently available via the API.\\nSometimes when I create a new Job, I get a 409 Conflict. What does it mean?\\nIn order to prevent duplicate orders from being entered into Cigo Tracker, we prevent orders with the same core\\ninformation from being re-entered. For example, if you have an order with the same first name, last name, address, and\\ndelivery date, we detect it as a duplicate job and prevent its creation.\\nThis default behaviour may not be suitable for your business if you can receive multiples orders per day by the same customer.\\nIn that case, setting a unique reference_id during the Job creation process will allow you to workaround this restriction.\\nIf you have a unique Order ID from an external system (e.g. Shopify), you can use that in your reference_id field and\\nCigo Tracker will ignore the duplicate check.\\nJobs were created via the API, but I can't find them anywhere.\\nIf you did not specify skip_staging: true in your POST call to create a Job, it'll be created in the staging status.\\nYou'll only be able to find this Job by logging into the Cigo Tracker web portal, opening the sidebar menu and navigating\\nthe Import Tool page. Once you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created Job records under the\\n'Review records from API Integration' tab.\\nWhat are Pickups and Drop-offs? How are they created?\\nPickups and Drop-offs are automatically generated by Cigo. Every Pickup and Drop-off is directly corelated to a Job Action\\nvia its stop_location_id. For instance, if a Job has an Action of type 'pickup' with a valid stop_location_id,\\nonce an Itinerary is created by your Dispatcher, a Pickup will automatically be created to indicate that it must be\\ndone prior to the related Job.\\nWhat is an Itinerary?\\nAn Itinerary is a detailed list of ordered Route Stops; including it's initial start and final return location,\\nestimated time of departure, as well as the assigned Operator(s) and Vehicle.\\nWhat is a Stop?\\nA Stop, or Route Stop, is simply a geographical location on an Itinerary and it can either a Job, a Pickup, or a Drop-off.\\nWhat is an Operator?\\nAn Operator is an individual assigned to an Itinerary. For instance, if your company handles the delivery of goods, you\\nmay already internally refer to your Operators as Drivers, as opposed to Technicians in other industries.\\nOperators interact with Cigo via our mobile application.\\nWhat is a Dispatcher?\\nA Dispatcher is a web platform user that is able to create Itineraries, create Jobs, Actions, and has direct access to the\\nStaging Area (inside of Cigo, the Staging Area is referred to as the 'Import Tool').\\nGeneral Notes\\n\\nUnless specified otherwise, time and datetime values returned by the API are in GMT (UTC+00:00).\\n\\nDiagram\\nHere's a Key Concepts Diagram to help you visualize how some of the concepts explained above correlate to one another.\\n\\nI still have questions!\\nIf you still have questions, feel free to shoot us an email: api.support@cigotracker.com\\nCredentials ValidationValidate Credentials Check that your authentication credentials are valid.\\nAuthorizations:BasicAuthResponses200 A sample response validating your authentication credentials.\\n401 Authentication information is missing or invalid.\\n409 API Access is disabled.\\ndefault An unexpected error occurred.\\nget/pingProduction Environment\\nhttps://app.cigotracker.com/api/v1/pingSandbox (Demo) Environment\\nhttps://app-demo.cigotracker.com/api/v1/ping Response samples 200401409Content typeapplication/jsonCopy Expand all  Collapse all {\\\"statusCode\\\": 200,\\\"status\\\": \\\"OK\\\",\\\"message\\\": \\\"Welcome to the Cigo Tracker API!\\\",\\\"details\\\": {\\\"client_ip\\\": \\\"<CLIENT_IP>\\\",\\\"company_name\\\": \\\"<COMPANY_NAME>\\\",\\\"tenant_name\\\": \\\"<COMPANY_NAME>\\\",\\\"docs\\\": \\\"<DOCS_URL>\\\"}}JobCreate a new Job Create a new Job in the staging area (also known as the Import Tool) to be reviewed by your Dispatcher(s).

Check API docs for details. Updated over 10 months agoTable of contentsUsing the Import Tool (CSV)Creating a Job via the web formCreating a Job via APIIf you intend on using a signature agreement, we recommend that your account administrator configures a default Signature Agreement. For instructions, read this article.There are three ways to configure Signature Agreements for jobs in Cigo Tracker. Using the Import Tool (CSV)When using the Import Tool, there is no direct way to define a Signature Agreement in your CSV file during the import process. Cigo Tracker will use the default Signature Agreement if one was set up by your administrator. Creating a Job via the web formWhile creating a job via the web form and entering customer information, you will find the \\\"Signature Agreement\\\" text field. By default, this field should appear in your form's \\\"Secondary\\\" section. If your administrator has set up a default Signature Agreement, it will automatically be applied to the job, but you can modify it if needed before creating the Job. It can also be edited as long as the status of the Job is still \\\"New\\\". Creating a Job via APITo configure a Signature Agreement when creating a job via the API, you need to set it up within your integration.  Detailed information about Signature Agreements can be found in the API documentation under the \\\"Job\\\" section, specifically \\\"Create a New Job\\\" and \\\"Signature Agreement.\\\"Related ArticlesGetting Started: The Settings PageCompany SettingsHow can I create a Signature Agreement in Cigo Tracker?Mastering the Cigo Tracker API: Key Concepts and FAQsGetting Started: Setting up my NotificationsDid this answer your question?😞😐😃HomeAPIStatus\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"qKzoRoAHMjUxNNX+6xTNM4jfxmm952vPJFfguyWym9w=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"3e75eff7-9498-4cc1-b6eb-b1fbb3d29a57":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3e75eff7-9498-4cc1-b6eb-b1fbb3d29a57\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cigotracker.com/industries/3pl-last-mile-delivery/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"3PL Last Mile Delivery Tracking with Optimized Routing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrack    Sign In\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nOptimized Routing\\nLogistics Optimization\\nLast Mile Management\\nCustomer Engagement\\nDelivery Tracking\\nIntegrations\\n\\n\\nCigo Pay\\nIndustries\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\nMedical\\nRetail Stores\\nHardware & Construction\\nAutomotive Industry\\nMeal Prep\\n3PL\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\nKnowledge Center\\nREST API Documentation\\nStatus\\n\\n\\nBlog\\nAbout\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nOptimized Routing\\nLogistics Optimization\\nLast Mile Management\\nCustomer Engagement\\nDelivery Tracking\\nIntegrations\\n\\n\\nCigo Pay\\nIndustries\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\nMedical\\nRetail Stores\\nHardware & Construction\\nAutomotive Industry\\nMeal Prep\\n3PL\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\nKnowledge Center\\nREST API Documentation\\nStatus\\n\\n\\nBlog\\nAbout\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrab Your Free Trial\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nOptimized Routing\\nLogistics Optimization\\nLast Mile Management\\nCustomer Engagement\\nDelivery Tracking\\nIntegrations\\n\\n\\nCigo Pay\\nIndustries\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\nMedical\\nRetail Stores\\nHardware & Construction\\nAutomotive Industry\\nMeal Prep\\n3PL\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\nKnowledge Center\\nREST API Documentation\\nStatus\\n\\n\\nBlog\\nAbout\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nOptimized Routing\\nLogistics Optimization\\nLast Mile Management\\nCustomer Engagement\\nDelivery Tracking\\nIntegrations\\n\\n\\nCigo Pay\\nIndustries\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\nMedical\\nRetail Stores\\nHardware & Construction\\nAutomotive Industry\\nMeal Prep\\n3PL\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\nKnowledge Center\\nREST API Documentation\\nStatus\\n\\n\\nBlog\\nAbout\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrack\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSign In\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFree Trial\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowFollowFollowFollow\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3PL Last Mile Delivery\\n\\nBy integrating our comprehensive tracking, routing, and communication tools, 3PL providers can offer unmatched service quality to their clients, ensuring efficient, transparent, and reliable delivery services.\\n\\n\\n\\nStart Your Free TrialHow Can Cigo Help?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClient Boost \\n\\nElevate Client Experiences with Cigo Tracker\\n\\nTransform your 3PL service offering with Cigo Tracker.\\nOur platform not only optimizes logistics operations but also significantly enhances the client experience through efficiency and reliability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimonials\\n\\nReviews From Our Customers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEasy Integration\\n\\nSeamless Integration and Scalability\\n\\nEffortlessly integrate Cigo Tracker into your existing systems, enjoying seamless scalability.

Below, you will find resource addresses, explanations, and examples showcasing how to use our API to access and manage Jobs, related Actions, and information regarding Itineraries created via Cigo Tracker.\\nOn the right hand side, you can navigate all available resources along with the responses each API endpoint produces.\\nWhat can you do with our API?The Cigo Tracker API enables you to:\\n\\nCreate, retrieve, update and delete Jobs\\nCreate, retrieve, update and delete Actions related to Jobs\\nCreate, retrieve, update and delete Itineraries\\nThis also allows you to dynamically preview potential Itinerary routes, assign operators, vehicles, and change stop positions\\n\\n\\nRetrieve Locations, Vehicles and Operators created within the platform\\n\\nAPI ConnectionsProduction\\nFor API connections in the production environment, specify the URL: https://app.cigotracker.com\\nSandbox (Demo)\\nFor API connections in the sandbox environment, specify the URL: https://app-demo.cigotracker.com\\n Important: Jobs created with a valid email and/or a mobile_number may be notified via Email and SMS to follow their order even in the sandbox environment. In your testing, we recommend only sending notifications to internal recipients.\\nWebhooksAfter enabling the API, you can manage webhooks from the web portal to monitor the following system actions:\\n\\nAll Job status changes\\nIndependent Job status changes: In Progress, Completed, Incomplete, Partially Completed, Damaged, Resolved\\nJob creation, information updates, and assignation to itinerary\\nJob Action creation, information updates (excluding status changes) or deletion via the Operator mobile app\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nAt this time, you cannot manage your webhooks via the API\\nYou must login as the Administrator of the account to enable the API and manage webhooks\\n\\nKey Concepts & FAQThere are some key Cigo concepts to understand in order to easily navigate documentation and use our API.\\nWhat is a Job?\\nA Job is a general term used in Cigo to describe a destination, such as a Customer, where your Operator(s) may do a\\ndelivery, a service call, an installation, or various Job Actions (see explanation on 'Job Action' below).\\nWhen a job is created via the API, its initial status value is staging. If you log in to Cigo, you can find this Job by opening the sidebar menu and navigating the Import Tool page.\\nOnce you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created API records under the 'Review records from API Integration' tab.\\nDispatcher will typically use the Import Tool to validate and review upcoming Jobs prior to dispatching them to vehicles. At a glance, they can validate if the address of each Job will be properly geo-coded and if the address string is valid.\\nHowever, if this step is not needed for your integration, you can skip the Import Tool when the Job is created via the API by setting skip_staging to true (for details, refer to the POST Create a new Job).\\nJob statuses range from:\\n\\nstaging: Jobs created with skip_staging: false (default) will return this status. Jobs in this state cannot be routed and have to be reviewed in the Import Tool.\\nnew: Jobs post-import (or if created via the API with skip_staging: true). This is the base state of a job that can be or has been added to an Itinerary's route.\\nin progress: Once an operator selects 'On Route' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state. If this isn't the first Job in the itinerary, the Job prior must have been started and finished before this status can be set.\\ncompleted: Once an operator selects 'Completed' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state. A job must have been in progress to be transitioned in this state.\\nincomplete: Once an operator selects 'Incomplete' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state. From the Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection. Furthermore, your organization can choose to enforce a report with either images and/or text explanations required for said report. This is managed from the Company Settings page, under the Fulfillment Options section.\\npartially completed: This state is special in the sense that an operator does not directly select it. Instead, a job is transitioned to this state only when an operator has one or many actions marked as either 'Damaged' or 'Incomplete' and chooses the 'Completed' state on the overall job. This results in a job being partially completed.\\ndamaged: Once an operator selects 'Damaged' in the mobile app, and fills out a report, the job will transition to this state. From the Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection.\\nresolved: This status is special. It cannot be set by the operators. Instead it is managed from the web after a job has been transitioned from either incomplete, damaged or partially completed, the status of the job can be transitioned to 'Resolved' by a web user. This can be useful to indicate that a prior mishap has been resolved and that this job no longer requires attention.\\n\\nWhat is a Job Action?\\nA Job can be assigned any number of Actions. These Actions serve as a to-do list for the Operator arriving on site\\n(i.e. a customer's location). Actions have types (i.e. delivery, installation, service, etc.) and other attributes,\\nsuch as handle time (the amount of time the action is estimated to take).\\nJob Action statuses range from:\\n\\nundetermined: No status has been set for this Job Action yet. This is the default state.\\ncompleted: This Job Action has been fulfilled without any issues.\\nincomplete: This Job Action could not be fulfilled.\\ndamaged: An incident is related to this Job Action.\\n\\nHow are Customer profiles created and updated?\\nWhen you create a new Job, an existing Customer profile is either linked or created. Customer profiles are created or updated\\nbased on a Job's first name, last name, phone number, and address fields.\\nWhen you first create a Job, you can assign a Customer Reference ID. When you create new Jobs assigned to the same\\nCustomer Reference ID, it'll keep all of them associated with the same Customer.\\nCan I create or update a Customer profile without creating or updating a Job?\\nNo, you cannot. Within the web interface, there are a few things you can update on an existing Customer profile, but\\nthis is not currently available via the API.\\nSometimes when I create a new Job, I get a 409 Conflict. What does it mean?\\nIn order to prevent duplicate orders from being entered into Cigo Tracker, we prevent orders with the same core\\ninformation from being re-entered. For example, if you have an order with the same first name, last name, address, and\\ndelivery date, we detect it as a duplicate job and prevent its creation.\\nThis default behaviour may not be suitable for your business if you can receive multiples orders per day by the same customer.\\nIn that case, setting a unique reference_id during the Job creation process will allow you to workaround this restriction.\\nIf you have a unique Order ID from an external system (e.g. Shopify), you can use that in your reference_id field and\\nCigo Tracker will ignore the duplicate check.\\nJobs were created via the API, but I can't find them anywhere.\\nIf you did not specify skip_staging: true in your POST call to create a Job, it'll be created in the staging status.\\nYou'll only be able to find this Job by logging into the Cigo Tracker web portal, opening the sidebar menu and navigating\\nthe Import Tool page. Once you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created Job records under the\\n'Review records from API Integration' tab.\\nWhat are Pickups and Drop-offs? How are they created?\\nPickups and Drop-offs are automatically generated by Cigo. Every Pickup and Drop-off is directly corelated to a Job Action\\nvia its stop_location_id. For instance, if a Job has an Action of type 'pickup' with a valid stop_location_id,\\nonce an Itinerary is created by your Dispatcher, a Pickup will automatically be created to indicate that it must be\\ndone prior to the related Job.\\nWhat is an Itinerary?\\nAn Itinerary is a detailed list of ordered Route Stops; including it's initial start and final return location,\\nestimated time of departure, as well as the assigned Operator(s) and Vehicle.\\nWhat is a Stop?\\nA Stop, or Route Stop, is simply a geographical location on an Itinerary and it can either a Job, a Pickup, or a Drop-off.\\nWhat is an Operator?\\nAn Operator is an individual assigned to an Itinerary. For instance, if your company handles the delivery of goods, you\\nmay already internally refer to your Operators as Drivers, as opposed to Technicians in other industries.\\nOperators interact with Cigo via our mobile application.\\nWhat is a Dispatcher?\\nA Dispatcher is a web platform user that is able to create Itineraries, create Jobs, Actions, and has direct access to the\\nStaging Area (inside of Cigo, the Staging Area is referred to as the 'Import Tool').\\nGeneral Notes\\n\\nUnless specified otherwise, time and datetime values returned by the API are in GMT (UTC+00:00).\\n\\nDiagram\\nHere's a Key Concepts Diagram to help you visualize how some of the concepts explained above correlate to one another.\\n\\nI still have questions!\\nIf you still have questions, feel free to shoot us an email: api.support@cigotracker.com\\nCredentials ValidationValidate Credentials Check that your authentication credentials are valid.\\nAuthorizations:BasicAuthResponses200 A sample response validating your authentication credentials.\\n401 Authentication information is missing or invalid.\\n409 API Access is disabled.\\ndefault An unexpected error occurred.\\nget/pingProduction Environment\\nhttps://app.cigotracker.com/api/v1/pingSandbox (Demo) Environment\\nhttps://app-demo.cigotracker.com/api/v1/ping Response samples 200401409Content typeapplication/jsonCopy Expand all  Collapse all {\\\"statusCode\\\": 200,\\\"status\\\": \\\"OK\\\",\\\"message\\\": \\\"Welcome to the Cigo Tracker API!\\\",\\\"details\\\": {\\\"client_ip\\\": \\\"<CLIENT_IP>\\\",\\\"company_name\\\": \\\"<COMPANY_NAME>\\\",\\\"tenant_name\\\": \\\"<COMPANY_NAME>\\\",\\\"docs\\\": \\\"<DOCS_URL>\\\"}}JobCreate a new Job Create a new Job in the staging area (also known as the Import Tool) to be reviewed by your Dispatcher(s).

It should be separated from the address itself to prevent geocoding errors when determining the location's geographical coordinates.\\npostal_codestring  [ 5 .. 7 ] characters  Postal Code or ZIP code associated with the address.\\ntime_preferencestring Enum: \\\"AM\\\" \\\"PM\\\" \\\"morning\\\" \\\"midday\\\" \\\"afternoon\\\" \\\"evening\\\" \\\"night\\\" null  Defines the Customer's time preference for the Job's arrival at their door.\\n Note: There are two Time Preference modes available in the Company Settings within the platform:\\n\\nBasic: Used for simple time preferences; AM and PM.\\nAdvanced: Used for more granular time preferences; morning, midday, afternoon, evening, night.\\n\\nIf the Time Preference mode is set to Advanced, and the AM value is submitted, it will be set to morning. Similarly, if PM is submitted, it will be converted to afternoon.\\nConversely, if the Time Preference mode is set to Basic, and either morning or midday are submitted, they will be converted to AM, and afternoon, evening and night will be converted to PM.\\nbalance_owednumber <float>   >= 0  Balance owed associated with the Job (positive number with up to 2 decimal points).\\ncommentstring  <= 2500 characters  Any comment or note associated with the Job. Line-breaks are supported via the newline (\\\\n) character.\\nsignature_agreementstring  <= 2500 characters  The signature agreement is used when the recipient of a Job is prompted to provide their signature as confirmation. This only applies if skip_staging is set to true. \\nbranch_idstring  <= 30 characters  Branch or Store ID associated with this Job. Ensure this ID is associated to an existing Branch in our platform.\\ndistribution_center_idstring  <= 30 characters  Distribution Center or Warehouse ID associated with this Job. Ensure this ID is associated to an existing Distribution Center in our platform.\\ntime_frameobject Set the approximate Time Frame within which the Job should be started and operators should be on Customer site.\\n Note: Do not set these values if you want the platform to automatically calculate accurate time frame start and end values based on the Itinerary route and traffic data.\\ninvoicesArray of strings  unique [ items  <= 60 characters  ] List of Invoice numbers associated with this Job\\nbarcodesArray of strings[ items  <= 60 characters  ] List of barcodes associated with this Job\\nlabel_countinteger  >= 1  The number of labels associated with this Job.\\nNote: This variable is used exclusively with our label printing integration. Do not set this if it is not enabled.\\nreference_idstring  <= 25 characters  External system reference ID associated with this Job for your convenience. This ID should be unique for every new Job. If you do not provide one, we will automatically generate a unique Job ID.\\ncustomer_reference_idstring  <= 25 characters  External system for Customer reference ID associated with this Job. This only applies if skip_staging is set to true. If you do not provide one, we will automatically generate one (this only applies if the Job is matched to a Customer that does not already exist in our system).\\nskip_stagingboolean If true, the Job created will skip the staging area (Import Tool). If you did not specify the geo-coordinates of this Job, we will automatically geocode the address you've provided. For invalid addresses that fail geocoding, the Job creation will be rejected and you will receive a 400 error response code.\\nactionsArray of objects (Job Action model)  Actions to create in association with this Job. You can create a maximum of 200 actions via this POST request. Additional actions should be created via POST Create a new Job Action. For actions that are the same, we recommend grouping them together under one action and setting its quantity accordingly.\\nResponses201 Created Job resource for specified jobID successfully.\\n400 Missing Required Fields in Create a new Job\\n401 Authentication information is missing or invalid.\\n409 API Access is disabled.\\ndefault An unexpected error occurred.\\npost/jobsProduction Environment\\nhttps://app.cigotracker.com/api/v1/jobsSandbox (Demo) Environment\\nhttps://app-demo.cigotracker.com/api/v1/jobs Request samples PayloadContent typeapplication/jsonCopy Expand all  Collapse all {\\\"type\\\": \\\"delivery\\\",\\\"quick_desc\\\": \\\"SAMPLE\\\",\\\"date\\\": \\\"2024-08-01\\\",\\\"original_date\\\": \\\"2019-03-29\\\",\\\"confirmation_status\\\": \\\"confirmed\\\",\\\"first_name\\\": \\\"John\\\",\\\"last_name\\\": \\\"Doe\\\",\\\"phone_number\\\": \\\"+15062345678\\\",\\\"mobile_number\\\": \\\"+15062345678\\\",\\\"email\\\": \\\"john.doe@example.com\\\",\\\"address\\\": \\\"275 Notre-Dame St. East, Montreal, QC, H2Y 1C6\\\",\\\"coordinates\\\": [46.7727384,-71.3180309],\\\"apartment\\\": \\\"Suite 101\\\",\\\"postal_code\\\": \\\"H2Y 1C6\\\",\\\"time_preference\\\": \\\"AM\\\",\\\"balance_owed\\\": 265.89,\\\"comment\\\": \\\"A sample comment regarding the Job for John Doe!\\\",\\\"signature_agreement\\\": \\\"Sample signature agreement shared with customer.\\\",\\\"branch_id\\\": \\\"S10\\\",\\\"distribution_center_id\\\": \\\"DC12\\\",\\\"time_frame\\\": {\\\"start\\\": \\\"9:00 AM\\\",\\\"end\\\": \\\"11:00 AM\\\"},\\\"invoices\\\": [\\\"17823657812563\\\"],\\\"barcodes\\\": [\\\"17823657812563\\\"],\\\"label_count\\\": 3,\\\"reference_id\\\": \\\"J-WJG318322\\\",\\\"customer_reference_id\\\": \\\"C-WJG178262\\\",\\\"skip_staging\\\": false,\\\"actions\\\": [{\\\"id\\\": \\\"73165560\\\",\\\"type\\\": \\\"delivery\\\",\\\"description\\\": \\\"Astin Sofa - Grey\\\",\\\"value\\\": 1149.96,\\\"unit_weight\\\": 120.5,\\\"unit_volume\\\": 2.75,\\\"piece_count\\\": 1,\\\"piece_count_unit\\\": \\\"boxes\\\",\\\"quantity\\\": 2,\\\"quantity_unit\\\": \\\"bundles\\\",\\\"handle_time\\\": 10,\\\"stop_location_id\\\": \\\"B12\\\",\\\"stop_location\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"Stop Location A\\\",\\\"geolocation\\\": {\\\"coordinates\\\": [46.7727384,-71.3180309]},\\\"time_frame\\\": {\\\"start\\\": \\\"9:00 AM\\\",\\\"end\\\": \\\"11:00 AM\\\"}},\\\"invoice_number\\\": \\\"9871236WE127836\\\",\\\"shipping_barcode\\\": \\\"1234567890\\\",\\\"external_reference_id\\\": \\\"CJA20121105TBA69420\\\"}]} Response samples 201400401409Content typeapplication/jsonCopy{\\\"statusCode\\\": 201,\\\"status\\\": \\\"Created\\\",\\\"message\\\": \\\"Successfully created a job for staging.

Acting as a pivotal bridge, Cigo Tracker ensures that communication flows effortlessly and operational workflows are streamlined to meet the specific demands of logistics and delivery services.  By exploring the features and capabilities of Cigo Tracker, businesses can revolutionize their operational strategies and elevate their engagement with customers, marking a significant shift in their delivery and service processes. What Is a Job in Cigo Tracker?A Job is a general term used in Cigo Tracker  to describe a destination, such as a Customer, where your Operator(s) may do a delivery, a service call, an installation, or various Job Actions (see explanation on 'Job Action' below).When a job is created via the API, its initial status value is staging. If you log in to Cigo, you can find this Job by opening the sidebar menu and navigating the Import Tool page. Once you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created API records under the 'Review records from API Integration' tab.Dispatcher will typically use the Import Tool to validate and review upcoming Jobs prior to dispatching them to vehicles. At a glance, they can validate if the address of each Job will be properly geo-coded and if the address string is valid.However, if this step is not needed for your integration, you can skip the Import Tool when the Job is created via the API by setting skip_staging to true (for details, refer to the POST Create a new Job). Navigating Job StatusesManaging job processes effectively is vital to ensure smooth operations within any logistics or delivery company. Cigo Tracker offers a comprehensive system to monitor and manage the status of jobs, catering to the nuanced needs of such businesses. The job statuses in Cigo Tracker reflect the lifecycle of a job from creation to completion, portraying transparency and control at each step.staging: Jobs created with skip_staging: false (default) will return this status. Jobs in this state cannot be routed and have to be reviewed in the Import Tool.new: Jobs post-import (or if created via the API with skip_staging: true). This is the base state of a job that can be or has been added to an Itinerary's route.in progress: Once an operator selects 'On Route' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state. If this isn't the first Job in the itinerary, the Job prior must have been started and finished before this status can be set.completed: Once an operator selects 'Completed' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state. A job must have been in progress to be transitioned in this state.incomplete: Once an operator selects 'Incomplete' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state. From the Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection. Furthermore, your organization can choose to enforce a report with either images and/or text explanations required for said report. This is managed from the Company Settings page, under the Fulfillment Options section.partially completed: This state is special in the sense that an operator does not directly select it. Instead, a job is transitioned to this state only when an operator has one or many actions marked as either 'Damaged' or 'Incomplete' and chooses the 'Completed' state on the overall job. This results in a job being partially completed.damaged: Once an operator selects 'Damaged' in the mobile app, and fills out a report, the job will transition to this state. From the Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection.resolved: This status is special. It cannot be set by the operators. Instead it is managed from the web after a job has been transitioned from either incomplete, damaged or partially completed, the status of the job can be transitioned to 'Resolved' by a web user. This can be useful to indicate that a prior mishap has been resolved and that this job no longer requires attention. Job Actions ExplainedA Job can be assigned any number of Actions. These Actions serve as a to-do list for the Operator arriving on site (i.e. a customer’s location). Actions have types (i.e. delivery, installation, service, etc.) and other attributes, such as handle time (the amount of time the action is estimated to take).Job Action statuses range from:undetermined: No status has been set for this Job Action yet. This is the default state.completed: This Job Action has been fulfilled without any issues.incomplete: This Job Action could not be fulfilled.damaged: An incident is related to this Job Action. Customer Profile IntegrationNavigating through Cigo Tracker’s logistics management system, one finds the sophisticated Customer Profile Integration at its core. Each time a new Job is initiated, Cigo  Tracker intuitively connects to an existing Customer profile or establishes a new one, anchored by a unique Customer Reference ID. This seamless integration is pivotal to maintaining organized, up-to-date customer records and facilitating quick, reliable access to customer details across the platform. How are Customer profiles created and updated?When you create a new Job, an existing Customer profile is either linked or created. Customer profiles are created or updated based on a Job's first name, last name, phone number, and address fields. When you first create a Job, you can assign a Customer Reference ID. When you create new Jobs assigned to the same Customer Reference ID, it'll keep all of them associated with the same Customer. Can I create or update a Customer profile without creating or updating a Job?No, you cannot. Within the web interface, there are a few things you can update on an existing Customer profile, but this is not currently available via the API. Overcoming Data Conflicts and Enhancing Job Management in Cigo TrackerOur focused insights help you address the common challenge of 409 Conflict Errors, ensuring smooth data processing and integration. Additionally, we provide guidance on efficiently locating jobs and mastering the Import Tool, which is crucial for maintaining the flow of operations within Cigo Tracker’s dynamic environment. This foundation sets the stage for flawless logistical coordination and enhanced service delivery. Handling 409 Conflict ErrorsIn order to prevent duplicate orders from being entered into Cigo Tracker, we prevent orders with the same core information from being re-entered. For example, if you have an order with the same first name, last name, address, and delivery date, we detect it as a duplicate job and prevent its creation. This default behaviour may not be suitable for your business if you can receive multiple orders per day from the same customer. In that case, setting a unique reference_id during the Job creation process will allow you to work around this restriction. If you have a unique Order ID from an external system (e.g. Shopify), you can use that in your reference_id field, and Cigo Tracker will ignore the duplicate check. Locating Jobs and Navigating the Import ToolIf you did not specify skip_staging: true in your POST call to create a Job, it'll be created in the staging status. You'll only be able to find this Job by logging into the Cigo Tracker web portal, opening the sidebar menu and navigating the Import Tool page. Once you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created Job records under the 'Review records from API Integration' tab. Streamlining Delivery Management: Pickups, Drop-offs, and Itineraries in Cigo TrackerEfficiency in delivery management is crucial for any logistics operation. Cigo Tracker provides a solution that seamlessly integrates pickups, drop-offs, and itineraries to simplify these processes for dispatchers and delivery personnel. What are Pickups and Drop-offs? How are they created?Pickups and Drop-offs are automatically generated by Cigo Tracker. Every Pickup and Drop-off is directly correlated to a Job Action via its stop_location_id.  For instance, if a Job has an Action of type 'pickup' with a valid stop_location_id, once an Itinerary is created by your Dispatcher, a Pickup will automatically be created to indicate that it must be done prior to the related Job. What is an Itinerary?An Itinerary is a detailed list of ordered Route Stops, including its initial start and final return location, estimated time of departure, as well as the assigned Operator(s) and Vehicle. What is a Stop?A Stop, or Route Stop, is simply a geographical location on an Itinerary and it can either a Job, a Pickup, or a Drop-off. The Roles Within the Cigo PlatformThe Cigo Tracker platform is designed to streamline logistics and delivery services by defining clear roles and functions for its users. These roles, which include Operators and Dispatchers, work in tandem to ensure a seamless delivery process from start to finish. The Role of an OperatorAn Operator is an individual assigned to an Itinerary. For instance, if your company handles the delivery of goods, you may already internally refer to your Operators as Drivers, as opposed to Technicians in other industries. Operators interact with Cigo Tracker via our mobile application. The Dispatcher’s FunctionalityA Dispatcher is a web platform user who is able to create Itineraries, Jobs, and Actions and has direct access to the Staging Area (inside of Cigo Tracker, the Staging Area is referred to as the \\\"Import Tool\\\").

Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection.resolved: This status is special.It cannot be set by the operators.Instead it is managed from the web after a job has been transitioned from either incomplete, damaged or partially completed, the status of the job can be transitioned to 'Resolved' by a web user.This can be useful to indicate that a prior mishap has been resolved and that this job no longer requires attention.What is a Job Action?A Job can be assigned any number of Actions.These Actions serve as a to-do list for the Operator arriving on site\\n(i.e. a customer's location).Actions have types (i.e. delivery, installation, service, etc.) and other attributes,\\nsuch as handle time (the amount of time the action is estimated to take).Job Action statuses range from:\\n\\nundetermined: No status has been set for this Job Action yet.This is the default state.completed: This Job Action has been fulfilled without any issues.incomplete: This Job Action could not be fulfilled.damaged: An incident is related to this Job Action.How are Customer profiles created and updated?When you create a new Job, an existing Customer profile is either linked or created.Customer profiles are created or updated\\nbased on a Job's first name, last name, phone number, and address fields.When you first create a Job, you can assign a Customer Reference ID.When you create new Jobs assigned to the same\\nCustomer Reference ID, it'll keep all of them associated with the same Customer.Can I create or update a Customer profile without creating or updating a Job?No, you cannot.Within the web interface, there are a few things you can update on an existing Customer profile, but\\nthis is not currently available via the API.Sometimes when I create a new Job, I get a 409 Conflict.What does it mean?In order to prevent duplicate orders from being entered into Cigo Tracker, we prevent orders with the same core\\ninformation from being re-entered.For example, if you have an order with the same first name, last name, address, and\\ndelivery date, we detect it as a duplicate job and prevent its creation.This default behaviour may not be suitable for your business if you can receive multiples orders per day by the same customer.In that case, setting a unique reference_id during the Job creation process will allow you to workaround this restriction.If you have a unique Order ID from an external system (e.g.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"QgRlj/IDby//XyFA2eQXjv8oJJ6V5NMx9G9o2yyPN9w=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"460fdb05-85e9-4591-8952-cd11563db97b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"460fdb05-85e9-4591-8952-cd11563db97b\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://app.cigotracker.com/api\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"1dfa4340-bdff-413c-a336-45c8dfac5c66\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://app.cigotracker.com/api\"},\"hash\":\"3GgpzfezHO7W2KenTZ2JDK0lLR3rviZow/RllVtD+mo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"c2214e06-89f5-4362-b1b6-8af9b817b6c3\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://app.cigotracker.com/api\"},\"hash\":\"ekhOajxFX2Hw2lCmUNMBykqvOmCaw5NoH2cWEhw+Dj4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ac618247-2d27-4db4-b3db-20d801707b13\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"dzdeo7RvamPKFUqaWWYIdqrVMNYjSjrE9BExkyLKBzk=\"}},\"text\":\"Can

Tracker will ignore the duplicate check.Jobs were created via the API, but I can't find them anywhere.If you did not specify skip_staging: true in your POST call to create a Job, it'll be created in the staging status.You'll only be able to find this Job by logging into the Cigo Tracker web portal, opening the sidebar menu and navigating\\nthe Import Tool page.Once you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created Job records under the\\n'Review records from API Integration' tab.What are Pickups and Drop-offs?How are they created?Pickups and Drop-offs are automatically generated by Cigo.Every Pickup and Drop-off is directly corelated to a Job Action\\nvia its stop_location_id.For instance, if a Job has an Action of type 'pickup' with a valid stop_location_id,\\nonce an Itinerary is created by your Dispatcher, a Pickup will automatically be created to indicate that it must be\\ndone prior to the related Job.What is an Itinerary?An Itinerary is a detailed list of ordered Route Stops; including it's initial start and final return location,\\nestimated time of departure, as well as the assigned Operator(s) and Vehicle.What is a Stop?A Stop, or Route Stop, is simply a geographical location on an Itinerary and it can either a Job, a Pickup, or a Drop-off.What is an Operator?An Operator is an individual assigned to an Itinerary.For instance, if your company handles the delivery of goods, you\\nmay already internally refer to your Operators as Drivers, as opposed to Technicians in other industries.Operators interact with Cigo via our mobile application.What is a Dispatcher?A Dispatcher is a web platform user that is able to create Itineraries, create Jobs, Actions, and has direct access to the\\nStaging Area (inside of Cigo, the Staging Area is referred to as the 'Import Tool').General Notes\\n\\nUnless specified otherwise, time and datetime values returned by the API are in GMT (UTC+00:00).Diagram\\nHere's a Key Concepts Diagram to

Creating a Job via the web formWhile creating a job via the web form and entering customer information, you will find the \\\"Signature Agreement\\\" text field. By default, this field should appear in your form's \\\"Secondary\\\" section. If your administrator has set up a default Signature Agreement, it will automatically be applied to the job, but you can modify it if needed before creating the Job. It can also be edited as long as the status of the Job is still \\\"New\\\". Creating a Job via APITo configure a Signature Agreement when creating a job via the API, you need to set it up within your integration.  Detailed information about Signature Agreements can be found in the API documentation under the \\\"Job\\\" section, specifically \\\"Create a New Job\\\" and \\\"Signature Agreement.\\\"Related ArticlesGetting Started: The Settings PageCompany SettingsHow can I create a Signature Agreement in Cigo Tracker?Mastering the Cigo Tracker API: Key Concepts and FAQsGetting Started: Setting up my NotificationsDid this answer your question?😞😐😃HomeAPIStatus\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2556,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"88c6l0phdXBdMvZ/VlRXEm32LLcQA1bHhQcQdggcsS4=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c8087fbf-feaf-4934-a4b1-3ea45b689deb":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c8087fbf-feaf-4934-a4b1-3ea45b689deb\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cigotracker.com/industries/3pl-last-mile-delivery/\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"3e75eff7-9498-4cc1-b6eb-b1fbb3d29a57\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cigotracker.com/industries/3pl-last-mile-delivery/\"},\"hash\":\"TeUp7jGxDJnjAbwR0+I9Sye3JZm3d7wj2zNMF39eQRo=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ff6e00f5-db91-4e85-8ae5-ca46e8bdb839\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"SLgvzQSD/Sgk5bvb62yNZne9kG+oxW9HL+IOzGrBUVo=\"}},\"text\":\"3PL Last Mile Delivery Tracking with Optimized Routing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrack    Sign In\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nOptimized Routing\\nLogistics Optimization\\nLast Mile Management\\nCustomer Engagement\\nDelivery Tracking\\nIntegrations\\n\\n\\nCigo Pay\\nIndustries\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\nMedical\\nRetail Stores\\nHardware & Construction\\nAutomotive Industry\\nMeal Prep\\n3PL\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\nKnowledge Center\\nREST API Documentation\\nStatus\\n\\n\\nBlog\\nAbout\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nOptimized Routing\\nLogistics Optimization\\nLast Mile Management\\nCustomer Engagement\\nDelivery Tracking\\nIntegrations\\n\\n\\nCigo Pay\\nIndustries\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\nMedical\\nRetail Stores\\nHardware & Construction\\nAutomotive Industry\\nMeal Prep\\n3PL\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\nKnowledge Center\\nREST API Documentation\\nStatus\\n\\n\\nBlog\\nAbout\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrab Your Free Trial\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nOptimized Routing\\nLogistics Optimization\\nLast Mile Management\\nCustomer Engagement\\nDelivery Tracking\\nIntegrations\\n\\n\\nCigo Pay\\nIndustries\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\nMedical\\nRetail Stores\\nHardware & Construction\\nAutomotive Industry\\nMeal Prep\\n3PL\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\nKnowledge Center\\nREST API Documentation\\nStatus\\n\\n\\nBlog\\nAbout\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nOptimized Routing\\nLogistics Optimization\\nLast Mile Management\\nCustomer Engagement\\nDelivery Tracking\\nIntegrations\\n\\n\\nCigo Pay\\nIndustries\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\nMedical\\nRetail Stores\\nHardware & Construction\\nAutomotive Industry\\nMeal Prep\\n3PL\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\nKnowledge Center\\nREST API Documentation\\nStatus\\n\\n\\nBlog\\nAbout\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrack\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSign In\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFree Trial\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowFollowFollowFollow\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3PL Last Mile Delivery\\n\\nBy integrating our comprehensive tracking, routing, and communication tools, 3PL providers can offer unmatched service quality to their clients, ensuring efficient, transparent, and reliable delivery services.\\n\\n\\n\\nStart Your Free TrialHow Can Cigo Help?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClient Boost \\n\\nElevate Client Experiences with Cigo Tracker\\n\\nTransform your 3PL service offering with Cigo Tracker.\\nOur platform not only optimizes logistics operations but also significantly enhances the client experience through efficiency and reliability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTestimonials\\n\\nReviews From Our Customers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEasy Integration\\n\\nSeamless Integration and Scalability\\n\\nEffortlessly integrate Cigo Tracker into your existing systems, enjoying seamless scalability.

the Administrator of the account to enable the API and manage webhooks\\n\\nKey Concepts & FAQThere are some key Cigo concepts to understand in order to easily navigate documentation and use our API.What is a Job?A Job is a general term used in Cigo to describe a destination, such as a Customer, where your Operator(s) may do a\\ndelivery, a service call, an installation, or various Job Actions (see explanation on 'Job Action' below).When a job is created via the API, its initial status value is staging.If you log in to Cigo, you can find this Job by opening the sidebar menu and navigating the Import Tool page.Once you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created API records under the 'Review records from API Integration' tab.Dispatcher will typically use the Import Tool to validate and review upcoming Jobs prior to dispatching them to vehicles.At a glance, they can validate if the address of each Job will be properly geo-coded and if the address string is valid.However, if this step is not needed for your integration, you can skip the Import Tool when the Job is created via the API by setting skip_staging to true (for details, refer to the POST Create a new Job).Job statuses range from:\\n\\nstaging: Jobs created with skip_staging: false (default) will return this status.Jobs in this state cannot be routed and have to be reviewed in the Import Tool.new: Jobs post-import (or if created via the API with skip_staging: true).This is the base state of a job that can be or has been added to an Itinerary's route.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"BKvaTTkgV9CpyKElUhuAwDTym5/RJy7F/Jt+VQ+1Qhw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"fd9dcaf3-c616-432d-b77d-38ff68a38865":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"fd9dcaf3-c616-432d-b77d-38ff68a38865\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cigotracker.com/api\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"16fee7a6-85ed-4bb7-8df1-d267477a8638\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cigotracker.com/api\"},\"hash\":\"dHOJcyyxVPVJnK3wUIXgTU5LsQD1KzvmctZZ6ey+9Ak=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5826366e-962b-43f9-800f-1775b003eb9f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cigotracker.com/api\"},\"hash\":\"BKvaTTkgV9CpyKElUhuAwDTym5/RJy7F/Jt+VQ+1Qhw=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"d5c6327e-9398-4a87-962a-99ba263e4f15\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"W5yM2P7FLXU1eggdF6JVk9l0sjutpXW/dBBQhh4Uj1I=\"}},\"text\":\"Dispatcher

reviewed in the Import Tool.new: Jobs post-import (or if created via the API with skip_staging: true).This is the base state of a job that can be or has been added to an Itinerary's route.in progress: Once an operator selects 'On Route' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state.If this isn't the first Job in the itinerary, the Job prior must have been started and finished before this status can be set.completed: Once an operator selects 'Completed' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state.A job must have been in progress to be transitioned in this state.incomplete: Once an operator selects 'Incomplete' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state.From the Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection.Furthermore, your organization can choose to enforce a report with either images and/or text explanations required for said report.This is managed from the Company Settings page, under the Fulfillment Options section.partially completed: This state is special in the sense that an operator does not directly select it.Instead, a job is transitioned to this state only when an operator has one or many actions marked as either 'Damaged' or 'Incomplete' and chooses the 'Completed' state on the overall job.This results in a job being partially completed.damaged: Once an operator selects 'Damaged' in the mobile app, and fills out a report, the job will transition to this state.From the Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection.resolved: This status is special.It cannot be set by the operators.Instead it is managed from the web after a job has been transitioned from either incomplete, damaged or partially completed, the status of the job can be transitioned to 'Resolved' by a web user.This can be useful to indicate that a prior mishap has been resolved and that this job no longer requires attention.What is a Job Action?A Job can be assigned any number of Actions.These Actions serve as a to-do list for the Operator arriving on site\\n(i.e. a customer's location).Actions have types (i.e. delivery, installation, service, etc.) and other attributes,\\nsuch as handle time (the amount of time the action is estimated to take).Job Action statuses range from:\\n\\nundetermined: No status has been set for this Job Action yet.This is the default state.completed: This Job Action has been fulfilled without any issues.incomplete: This Job Action could not be fulfilled.damaged: An incident is related to this Job Action.How are Customer profiles created and updated?When you create a new Job, an existing Customer profile is either linked or created.Customer profiles are created or updated\\nbased on a Job's first name, last name, phone number, and address fields.When you first create a Job, you can assign a Customer Reference ID.When you create new Jobs assigned to the same\\nCustomer Reference ID, it'll keep all of them associated with the same Customer.Can I create or update a Customer profile without creating or updating a Job?No, you cannot.Within the web interface, there are a few things you can update on an existing Customer profile, but\\nthis is not currently available via the API.Sometimes when I create a new Job, I get a 409 Conflict.What does it mean?In order to prevent duplicate orders from being entered into Cigo Tracker, we prevent orders with the same core\\ninformation from being re-entered.For example, if you have an order with the same first name, last name, address, and\\ndelivery date, we detect it as a duplicate job and prevent its creation.This default behaviour may not be suitable for your business if you can receive multiples orders per day by the same customer.In that case, setting a unique reference_id during the Job creation process will allow you to workaround this restriction.If you have a unique Order ID from an external system (e.g.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"HUlb95jAh7pq6pqUMDAK67kStta8+iQmExnLx8ifa0Q=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d5c6327e-9398-4a87-962a-99ba263e4f15":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d5c6327e-9398-4a87-962a-99ba263e4f15\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cigotracker.com/api\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"16fee7a6-85ed-4bb7-8df1-d267477a8638\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cigotracker.com/api\"},\"hash\":\"dHOJcyyxVPVJnK3wUIXgTU5LsQD1KzvmctZZ6ey+9Ak=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"fd9dcaf3-c616-432d-b77d-38ff68a38865\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://cigotracker.com/api\"},\"hash\":\"ekhOajxFX2Hw2lCmUNMBykqvOmCaw5NoH2cWEhw+Dj4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c6f055cf-776c-4fc4-a3a4-c835f43a1da1\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"dzdeo7RvamPKFUqaWWYIdqrVMNYjSjrE9BExkyLKBzk=\"}},\"text\":\"Can

Tracker will ignore the duplicate check.Jobs were created via the API, but I can't find them anywhere.If you did not specify skip_staging: true in your POST call to create a Job, it'll be created in the staging status.You'll only be able to find this Job by logging into the Cigo Tracker web portal, opening the sidebar menu and navigating\\nthe Import Tool page.Once you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created Job records under the\\n'Review records from API Integration' tab.What are Pickups and Drop-offs?How are they created?Pickups and Drop-offs are automatically generated by Cigo.Every Pickup and Drop-off is directly corelated to a Job Action\\nvia its stop_location_id.For instance, if a Job has an Action of type 'pickup' with a valid stop_location_id,\\nonce an Itinerary is created by your Dispatcher, a Pickup will automatically be created to indicate that it must be\\ndone prior to the related Job.What is an Itinerary?An Itinerary is a detailed list of ordered Route Stops; including it's initial start and final return location,\\nestimated time of departure, as well as the assigned Operator(s) and Vehicle.What is a Stop?A Stop, or Route Stop, is simply a geographical location on an Itinerary and it can either a Job, a Pickup, or a Drop-off.What is an Operator?An Operator is an individual assigned to an Itinerary.For instance, if your company handles the delivery of goods, you\\nmay already internally refer to your Operators as Drivers, as opposed to Technicians in other industries.Operators interact with Cigo via our mobile application.What is a Dispatcher?A Dispatcher is a web platform user that is able to create Itineraries, create Jobs, Actions, and has direct access to the\\nStaging Area (inside of Cigo, the Staging Area is referred to as the 'Import Tool').General Notes\\n\\nUnless specified otherwise, time and datetime values returned by the API are in GMT (UTC+00:00).Diagram\\nHere's a Key Concepts Diagram to

Drop-offs, and Itineraries in Cigo TrackerThe Roles Within the Cigo PlatformSupplementary Information and ResourcesUnderstanding the Cigo Tracker API: An Essential Guide Connecting Operations and CustomersCigo Tracker serves as a transformative platform that effectively merges daily logistics operations with superior customer experience.Acting as a pivotal bridge, Cigo Tracker ensures that communication flows effortlessly and operational workflows are streamlined to meet the specific demands of logistics and delivery services.By exploring the features and capabilities of Cigo Tracker, businesses can revolutionize their operational strategies and elevate their engagement with customers, marking a significant shift in their delivery and service processes.What Is a Job in Cigo Tracker?A Job is a general term used in Cigo Tracker  to describe a destination, such as a Customer, where your Operator(s) may do a delivery, a service call, an installation, or various Job Actions (see explanation on 'Job Action' below).When a job is created via the API, its initial status value is staging.If you log in to Cigo, you can find this Job by opening the sidebar menu and navigating the Import Tool page.Once you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created API records under the 'Review records from API Integration' tab.Dispatcher will typically use the Import Tool to validate and review upcoming Jobs prior to dispatching them to vehicles.At a glance, they can validate if the address of each Job will be properly geo-coded and if the address string is valid.However, if this step is not needed for your integration, you can skip the Import Tool when the Job is created via the API by setting skip_staging to true (for details, refer to the POST Create a new Job).Navigating Job StatusesManaging job processes effectively is vital to ensure smooth operations within any logistics or delivery company.Cigo Tracker offers a comprehensive system to monitor and manage the status of jobs, catering to the nuanced needs of such businesses.The job statuses in Cigo Tracker reflect the lifecycle of a job from creation to completion, portraying transparency and control at each step.staging: Jobs created with skip_staging: false (default) will return this status.Jobs in this state cannot be routed and have to be reviewed in the Import Tool.new: Jobs post-import (or if created via the API with skip_staging: true).This is the base state of a job that can be or has been added to an Itinerary's route.in progress: Once an operator selects 'On Route' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state.If this isn't the first Job in the itinerary, the Job prior must have been started and finished before this status can be set.completed: Once an operator selects 'Completed' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state.A job must have been in progress to be transitioned in this state.incomplete: Once an operator selects 'Incomplete' in the mobile app, the job will transition to this state.From the Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection.Furthermore, your organization can choose to enforce a report with either images and/or text explanations required for said report.This is managed from the Company Settings page, under the Fulfillment Options section.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"/XT2Boxf54NO3w9LOYITXN+nQAT6wb1U2jeCTYjIWcA=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0f40f952-fad5-41a7-999e-d450931fac50":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0f40f952-fad5-41a7-999e-d450931fac50\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://help.cigotracker.com/en/articles/8807564-mastering-the-cigo-tracker-api-key-concepts-and-faqs\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"0fc08265-375d-4f29-8b97-d2fa3cfa0f27\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://help.cigotracker.com/en/articles/8807564-mastering-the-cigo-tracker-api-key-concepts-and-faqs\"},\"hash\":\"Nw7UpWOZdL4LDpffLK/sBdxQTPHqW1zzfJpF1LDLSOI=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"edcf94d8-f878-40a6-8a55-a16f303da2ae\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://help.cigotracker.com/en/articles/8807564-mastering-the-cigo-tracker-api-key-concepts-and-faqs\"},\"hash\":\"/XT2Boxf54NO3w9LOYITXN+nQAT6wb1U2jeCTYjIWcA=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"bccd56e1-4cd4-4e2c-a5a8-d8e24a88f7cf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"tAFnPvzSqG4S/UxeCF3FVjVafwUEKUa8txgHR9JNNp4=\"}},\"text\":\"in

that an operator does not directly select it.Instead, a job is transitioned to this state only when an operator has one or many actions marked as either 'Damaged' or 'Incomplete' and chooses the 'Completed' state on the overall job.This results in a job being partially completed.damaged: Once an operator selects 'Damaged' in the mobile app, and fills out a report, the job will transition to this state.From the Company Settings page, under the Operator App Options section, your organization can choose to disable this status option entirely, and it will not be available to the operator as a selection.resolved: This status is special.It cannot be set by the operators.Instead it is managed from the web after a job has been transitioned from either incomplete, damaged or partially completed, the status of the job can be transitioned to 'Resolved' by a web user.This can be useful to indicate that a prior mishap has been resolved and that this job no longer requires attention.Job Actions ExplainedA Job can be assigned any number of Actions.These Actions serve as a to-do list for the Operator arriving on site (i.e. a customer’s location).Actions have types (i.e. delivery, installation, service, etc.) and other attributes, such as handle time (the amount of time the action is estimated to take).Job Action statuses range from:undetermined: No status has been set for this Job Action yet.This is the default state.completed: This Job Action has been fulfilled without any issues.incomplete: This Job Action could not be fulfilled.damaged: An incident is related to this Job Action.Customer Profile IntegrationNavigating through Cigo Tracker’s logistics management system, one finds the sophisticated Customer Profile Integration at its core.Each time a new Job is initiated, Cigo  Tracker intuitively connects to an existing Customer profile or establishes a new one, anchored by a unique Customer Reference ID.This seamless integration is pivotal to maintaining organized, up-to-date customer records and facilitating quick, reliable access to customer details across the platform.How are Customer profiles created and updated?When you create a new Job, an existing Customer profile is either linked or created.Customer profiles are created or updated based on a Job's first name, last name, phone number, and address fields.When you first create a Job, you can assign a Customer Reference ID.When you create new Jobs assigned to the same Customer Reference ID, it'll keep all of them associated with the same Customer.Can I create or update a Customer profile without creating or updating a Job?No, you cannot.Within the web interface, there are a few things you can update on an existing Customer profile, but this is not currently available via the API.Overcoming Data Conflicts and Enhancing Job Management in Cigo TrackerOur focused insights help you address the common challenge of 409 Conflict Errors, ensuring smooth data processing and integration.Additionally, we provide guidance on efficiently locating jobs and mastering the Import Tool, which is crucial for maintaining the flow of operations within Cigo Tracker’s dynamic environment.This foundation sets the stage for flawless logistical coordination and enhanced service delivery.Handling 409 Conflict ErrorsIn order to prevent duplicate orders from being entered into Cigo Tracker, we prevent orders with the same core information from being re-entered.For example, if you have an order with the same first name, last name, address, and delivery date, we detect it as a duplicate job and prevent its creation.This default behaviour may not be suitable for your business if you can receive multiple orders per day from the same customer.In that case, setting a unique reference_id during the Job creation process will allow you to work around this restriction.If you have a unique Order ID from an external system (e.g.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"yrozWjzf8HRS2dqdHU/HONWHU33z+HVfawi+tiqZ6Nw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"bccd56e1-4cd4-4e2c-a5a8-d8e24a88f7cf":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"bccd56e1-4cd4-4e2c-a5a8-d8e24a88f7cf\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://help.cigotracker.com/en/articles/8807564-mastering-the-cigo-tracker-api-key-concepts-and-faqs\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"0fc08265-375d-4f29-8b97-d2fa3cfa0f27\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://help.cigotracker.com/en/articles/8807564-mastering-the-cigo-tracker-api-key-concepts-and-faqs\"},\"hash\":\"Nw7UpWOZdL4LDpffLK/sBdxQTPHqW1zzfJpF1LDLSOI=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"0f40f952-fad5-41a7-999e-d450931fac50\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://help.cigotracker.com/en/articles/8807564-mastering-the-cigo-tracker-api-key-concepts-and-faqs\"},\"hash\":\"yTneIpX9B/QcT+7yv6j7c/Pba0B7gNOK0cwQ88RYwF4=\"}},\"text\":\"Additionally,

be able to find this Job by logging into the Cigo Tracker web portal, opening the sidebar menu and navigating the Import Tool page.Once you've landed on the Import Tool page, you'll find your created Job records under the 'Review records from API Integration' tab.Streamlining Delivery Management: Pickups, Drop-offs, and Itineraries in Cigo TrackerEfficiency in delivery management is crucial for any logistics operation.Cigo Tracker provides a solution that seamlessly integrates pickups, drop-offs, and itineraries to simplify these processes for dispatchers and delivery personnel.What are Pickups and Drop-offs?How are they created?Pickups and Drop-offs are automatically generated by Cigo Tracker.Every Pickup and Drop-off is directly correlated to a Job Action via its stop_location_id.For instance, if a Job has an Action of type 'pickup' with a valid stop_location_id, once an Itinerary is created by your Dispatcher, a Pickup will automatically be created to indicate that it must be done prior to the related Job.What is an Itinerary?An Itinerary is a detailed list of ordered Route Stops, including its initial start and final return location, estimated time of departure, as well as the assigned Operator(s) and Vehicle.What is a Stop?A Stop, or Route Stop, is simply a geographical location on an Itinerary and it can either a Job, a Pickup, or a Drop-off.The Roles Within the Cigo PlatformThe Cigo Tracker platform is designed to streamline logistics and delivery services by defining clear roles and functions for its users.These roles, which include Operators and Dispatchers, work in tandem to ensure a seamless delivery process from start to finish.The Role of an OperatorAn Operator is an individual assigned to an Itinerary.For instance, if your company handles the delivery of goods, you may already internally refer to your Operators as Drivers, as opposed to Technicians in other industries.Operators interact with Cigo Tracker via our mobile application.The Dispatcher’s FunctionalityA Dispatcher is a web platform user who is able to create Itineraries, Jobs, and Actions and has direct access to the Staging Area (inside of Cigo Tracker, the Staging Area is referred to as the \\\"Import Tool\\\").Supplementary Information and ResourcesTime StandardsFor clarification, the majority of API time and date-time values are presented

You can also deactivate their API access from here or from the Merchants management page. What capabilities do Merchants have with the API?Merchants can retrieve their API credentials (API Account ID and API Auth Key) from the API Settings page. With these credentials, they can perform actions such as creating, updating, deleting, and searching Jobs and Actions they've created. Access to other API endpoints will be rejected. Can Merchants manage their own webhooks?No, Merchants cannot manage their own webhooks. Webhook notifications need to be set up by the Administrator. Configure webhooks through the Administrator account at Manage Webhooks or via Integrations > API. Ensure the appropriate Location is selected for the webhook URL. How do I manage Merchant accounts and API access?Manage Merchant accounts and API access through the provided link: Manage Merchants, or navigate to Organization > Merchants in the main menu. From there, you can grant API access, view API Account IDs, and manage other settings related to Merchants and their API access. ConclusionIn conclusion, effectively managing Merchant accounts and API access is essential for ensuring seamless integration and optimal functionality of your platform. By following the guidelines outlined in this FAQ, you can empower your Merchant Level 2 users to leverage the REST API efficiently.  From granting API access to managing webhooks, these steps are fundamental in facilitating smooth operations and enhancing productivity for both administrators and merchants.
