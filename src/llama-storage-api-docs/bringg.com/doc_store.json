site or Order Management System (OMS) to Delivery Hub.\\nIf you work with fulfillments, we recommend including them as an object in the Orders endpoint. Alternatively, you can send the Order payload and Fulfillment payload separately.\\nAn order is a request to fulfill goods and services at a specific address and is the customer's view of what needs to be shipped. It includes the customer's address, links to the order's fulfillments, a list of inventory included in the order, and the delivery time window.Updated 10 months ago ChangelogCreate OrderDid this page

https://us2-api.bringg.com/v2/orders/quotesSend order details to your connected carriers and receive quotes including carrier availability, timing, and cost for each delivery.When you send the Get Quotes API request to display shipping rates on your e-commerce checkout page, Delivery Hub receives all of the information necessary to create an order, holding on to the data for when the order is actually created. Delivery Hub then sends individual rate requests to each carrier, translates all responses, and returns a single payload to your system. This payload includes an array (list) of quotes, each with a Quote ID, for you to display at checkout. Once your customer chooses a delivery option, your system should confirm the order and the selected quote by sending the Fulfill Order by Quote IDrequest. Delivery Hub then confirms the shipment with the carrier.\\nBody ParamscurrencystringrequiredThe currency used for transactions in this order.AEDAFNALLAMDANGAOAARSAUDAWGAZNBAMBBDBDTBGNBHDBIFBMDBNDBOBBOVBRLBSDBTNBWPBYNBZDCADCDFCHECHFCHWCLFCLPCNYCOPCOUCRCCUCCUPCVECZKDJFDKKDOPDZDEGPERNETBEURFJDFKPGBPGELGHSGIPGMDGNFGTQGYDHKDHNLHRKHTGHUFIDRILSINRIQDIRRISKJMDJODJPYKESKGSKHRKMFKPWKRWKWDKYDKZTLAKLBPLKRLRDLSLLYDMADMDLMGAMKDMMKMNTMOPMRUMURMVRMWKMXNMXVMYRMZNNADNGNNIONOKNPRNZDOMRPABPENPGKPHPPKRPLNPYGQARRONRSDRUBRWFSARSBDSCRSDGSEKSGDSHPSLLSOSSRDSSPSTNSVCSYPSZLTHBTJSTMTTNDTOPTRYTTDTWDTZSUAHUGXUSDUSNUYIUYUUYWUZSVESVNDVUVWSTXAFXAGXAUXBAXBBXBCXBDXCDXDRXOFXPDXPFXPTXSUXTSXUAYERZARZMWZWLbilling_addressobjectrequiredbilling_address objecttotal_priceint32requiredThe total price of this order, used for shipping rules and display in customer-facing documentation.

Note that this option is only available to Admin users.\\nApril 10, 2024\\nThe default label format for custom shipments is now ZPL instead of PDF.\\nMarch 5, 2024\\nWebhooks now include statuses on the package level. Note that package-level tracking is available when this level of detail is provided by the carrier.\\nJanuary 30, 2024\\n\\nYou can now send shipping manifests with the Manifest Shipments endpoint. The manifest includes a list of all shipments the carrier collected and the corresponding truck number.\\nNote that after creating a manifest, the shipments included are no longer editable. Creating a manifest may also finalize shipping labels and add them to your invoice from the carrier.\\nWhen a new shipment is created using the Create Shipment form with a location ID, location_id is sent in webhooks in place of the complete address object.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2024\\n\\nYou can now determine the origin of a shipment in Delivery Hub using the new created_by parameter.\\nPossible values include:\\n\\napi (default)\\npacker for shipments created in the fulfillment screen\\nhub for shipments created in the Create Shipment screen\\n\\n\\n[Fixed bug] The shipment modal and webhooks did not include the user_id of users who created shipments using the Create Shipment form.\\nYou can now add Source IDs to products in the Create Shipment form in the UI.\\n\\nDecember 21, 2023\\n\\nCarrier cancellation reasons are now included in the Shipment Canceled webhook.\\nTo accommodate German phone numbers, Delivery Hub now validates phone numbers with fewer than eight digits. Learn more about formatting requirements in the Customer  object.\\n\\nNovember 15, 2023\\n\\nShipping labels are now stored in Delivery Hub's cloud file storage instead of being directly stored in the database. You can now find shipping label links under the label_url parameter in Shipment responses and webhooks, in addition to the base64-encoded label parameter.\\nTo streamline API integration and data management, the Shipments object can now be nested within the Fulfillment object when sending Create Fulfillment, Update Fulfillment, Create Order, and Update Order requests.\\nYou can now configure shipping rules using your internal service levels. For example, if certain hazardous materials require delivery within 72 hours, you can add the 72 hours tag to the required_service_level parameter, and create a shipping rule that assigns shipments with this tag to specified carrier services.\\nShipment responses and webhooks now include the carrier_tracking_url parameter so you can quickly access the carrier’s tracking page to follow shipment statuses.\\nFor greater flexibility, the validation requirements for the street1 and city parameters in the Address object have been updated. The minimum length for street1 is now 1 character, and the maximum length for city is now 40 characters.\\n\\nOctober 26, 2023\\nFor greater flexibility, the validation requirements for the street2 and street3 parameters in the Address object have been reduced to a minimum of 1 character when the field is filled (neither field is required). \\nOctober 4, 2023\\n\\nTo speed up carrier assignment using shipping rules, Delivery Hub’s quote requests to carriers now time out after 3 seconds.\\nThe Shipments webhook payloads now include the estimated_delivery_cost parameter, enabling you to compare quoted and actual prices once a shipment is confirmed.\\nTo improve custom label formatting, long reference fields are now truncated to fit neatly on the label.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2023\\n\\nIt is now easier to reduce costs in Delivery Hub! You can now automatically assign shipments to the cheapest carrier and service using shipping rules. To be sure that shipping rules are applied for a shipment, confirm that disable_shipping_rules is false.\\nLearn more about setting up Shipping Rules. \\nDelivery Hub now prints labels sequentially to reduce confusion and make it easier to attach the correct label to each package.\\n\\nSeptember 21, 2023\\nTo comply with carrier limitations and improve label formatting, the character limit for Customer names has been updated to 35.\\nSeptember 20, 2023\\nYou can now include a printer_id and tray_id in the Print Shipment Documents request, overriding selections in user settings.\\nSeptember 11, 2023\\nYou can now send shipment documents to print using the Print Documents API endpoint. Sending just the shipment ID prints all documents for a shipment, and you can optionally select to print only a specific document type, print documentation for only a specified shipment_package_id, and send to a specific printer_id.\\nSeptember 6, 2023\\n\\nYou can now access Proof of Delivery images (PNG/JPG) from carriers in webhooks and the Get Shipment API response via a convenient link in the proof_of_delivery parameter.\\nThe length restrictions of some address fields have changed, improving consistency between objects:\\n\\nphone:  10-15 characters\\nstreet1, street2, street3, city, state, and company: 2-35 characters\\npostal_code: 2-20 characters\\nname: 2-35 characters\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 23, 2023\\nShipments responses and webhooks now include an array of products included in the shipment.\\nAugust 16, 2023\\n\\nThe Shipment response now includes the base_charge in addition to net_charge, taxes, surcharges, and discounts.\\nShipping labels now include source IDs. To do this, Delivery Hub now includes the fulfillment source_ID in API requests to the carrier.\\nYou can now update items (products) in an order or fulfillment regardless of its status.\\nThe Get Quotes response now includes carrier names in each quote object. Previously, only the service_name and service_type were included.\\n\\nAugust 10, 2023\\n[Bug fix] Orders and fulfillments without any packed shipments were incorrectly marked as partially_fulfilled. Now, only orders and fulfillments with at least one shipment created are marked as partially_fulfilled and are otherwise considered new.\\nAugust 2, 2023\\n\\nYou can now delete a shipment using its source ID. Learn more.\\nYou can now update products in a fulfillment while the fulfillment’s status is partially_fulfilled (in addition to new). You can optionally push this change to the order level by adding \\\"force_products_update\\\" : true.  \\n\\nImportant notes:\\n\\nWhen the product id is not included, all required product fields (name, price, length, etc.) must be included.\\nWhen \\\"force_products_update\\\" : true is not included in the Update Fulfillment call, Delivery Hub only allows the addition of products on the fulfillment level if they are already included on the order level.\\n\\n\\nTo update a product, send the Update Fulfillment call with the new data in place of the old.\\nFor example, if a fulfillment includes a pair of jeans in size L and the customer requests size M instead, you can send the Update Fulfillment call with size M listed instead of L, and the product will be updated in Delivery Hub.\\nTo delete a product on the fulfillment level, send the Update Fulfillment call without the item to delete.\\nTo add a product, add it to the product array.\\nTo remove an item from one fulfillment and move it to another fulfillment in the same order:\\n\\nSend the Update Fulfillment call with the item removed from the Products list.\\nDo not include \\\"force_products_update\\\" : true (or mark this parameter as false) so the item isn’t removed from the order level. \\nSend another Update Fulfillment call for the fulfillment you want to move the item to, adding the item to the second fulfillment’s product list.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJuly 27, 2023\\n\\nShipping locations can now be identified using a source_id.\\nIDs generated in Delivery Hub now use integer format instead of string. This does not include source_id and quote_id parameters.\\nYou can now create a new Shipment in Delivery Hub using its source ID. Learn more.\\nThe locale parameter in the Customer object has been changed to language.\\n\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\nAPI spelling consistency has improved with more parameters and descriptions ‌using US English spelling. Instances of harmonised code are now harmonized code and fulfil are now fulfill.\\nFulfillments can now be created using a shipping location’s source ID. The parameter to include is shipment_location_source_id. Learn more about adding shipping locations in the Delivery Hub UI.\\n\\nJuly 10, 2023\\nThe following parameters have been added to the Fulfillment object to support PUDO and returns use cases:\\nParameterDescriptionPossible valuesfulfillment_methodDesignates if the fulfillment method is direct delivery to the recipient's address or via a PUDO (pickup/dropoff) location. When empty, the default value is direct.pudo directfulfillment_typeDesignates if this is a delivery or return. When empty, the default value is delivery.delivery returnpudo_location_idThe ID of the PUDO (pickup/drop off) location of the sender or recipient.Valid uuid\\nAlong with the new parameters, new validations have been added:\\n\\nEither sender_location_id or sender_ address are required.\\nEither recipient_location_id or recipient_ address are required.\\nIf the fulfillment_method is direct (not pudo), an error will be returned if a value is included for pudo_location_id.\\nWhen sending pudo_location_id, values are also required for shipping_account_id and service.\\n\\nJuly 4, 2023\\n\\n\\nThe locale parameter has been added to the customer object. The new parameter uses ISO 639-1 codes to define customer language for delivery notifications. Learn more about configuring notifications.\\n\\n\\nThe following deprecated parameters have been removed: sender_start, sender_end, recipient_start, and recipient_end.\\n\\n\\nYou can now use your external system's source ID for a location as the value for the sender_location_id and recipient_location_id parameters.\\n\\n\\nThere have been a few clarifications to the process of assigning statuses:\\n\\nShipment statuses cannot be assigned the PartiallyFulfilled status.\\nFulfillments with no shipments are assigned the New status.\\nFulfillments that have at least one shipment with a status of ReadyToShip are assigned the PartiallyFulfilled status.\\nDelivery Hub always displays the status that is earliest in the delivery flow for a list of shipments. For example, if an order or fulfillment has one shipment that is ready for carrier collection and another that is out for delivery, the order or fulfillment is assigned the ReadyToShip status.\\nOrders with no fulfillments are assigned the New status.\\n\\n\\nUpdated 7 months ago Welcome to Delivery Hub's API ReferenceOrdersDid this page help you?YesNoUpdated 7 months ago Welcome to
