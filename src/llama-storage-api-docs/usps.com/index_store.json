specification:DownloadUSPS Support: apisupport@usps.gov Terms of ServiceThe USPS® is verifying payment transaction details to enable their use in future transactions.This generates a payment authorization token that can be utilized in APIs requiring payment.The resulting payment authorization token also satisfies USPS® requirements identifying the parties involved in each transaction according to their role.See the labels and international-labels APIs specifications for how to use the payment authorization token.The payment authorization token is a prerequisite for using labels and international-labels APIs.For information on requirements for Mailer IDs(MID), please see Publication 199\nAuthentication, Authorization and Access Control\nClient applications are given authorized access to protected information resources.Authorization is accomplished via the USPS® Customer Onboarding Platform, where Customer Registration users may grant applications access to their protected business information.All client applications must go through this onboarding process.Any Customer Registration user wishing to share their protected business information with client application(s) may also grant authorized access.The OAuth2, version 3 (/v3) API is based on this authorization grant and must be used to get tokens for all V3 APIs.The resulting OAuth2 access token is to be placed in the *Authorization* header, using the *Bearer* authentication scheme.This is a similar implementation as was deployed for all version 1 (/v1) APIs.All version 3 APIs validate access to protected information resources and will respond with a *401* HTTP status, *Unauthorized* reason, when the client application has not been authorized to access the given information resource.The roles involved in payment transactions will include payment account identification.ResourcesSet payment account information.Create a payment authorization token that can be subsequently used for purchasing labels.Tokens are valid for eight hours after issuance.The roles input is required to generate this token.The roles object should contain information for each role for the transaction in which this token will be used.The PAYER and LABEL_OWNER roles are required to pay for any label transaction.The available roles are:\n\nPAYER - This role is used to specify who will pay for the transaction.When using the PAYER role, the PaymentAccount and CRID must be specified.RATE_HOLDER - This role is used to specify whose rates will be used in the transaction.When using the RATE_HOLDER role, the

apisupport@usps.gov Terms of ServiceThe Intelligent Mail Container barcode (IMcb) provides visibility at the mail aggregate level.It is used on mailer-generated pallet labels to uniquely identify pallets and similar containers (i.e. All Purpose Containers, hampers, pallet boxes, etc.) in addition to identifying the mail owner and, it provides a link between the electronic mailing record and the physical mail aggregate.The IMcb uniquely identifies the mail owner, mail preparer, or consolidator by way of the Mailer ID field.Furthermore, the IMcb establishes a unique \"serial number\" for each container.These two features allow each container to be associated with a unique mailing and facilitate tracking of containers as they are loaded and unloaded from transportation.The IMcb is printed on Mailer-generated pallet labels and is designed to be scanned at acceptance and at other points throughout the transportation and processing network.Other human-readable data elements, beyond the IM Container barcode, such as text identifying the mail owner, destination, and type of mail are also required on the container placard.Further information on the use of this barcode can be found in the Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service®, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM 300).ResourcesAdd packages or mail to a container manifest.When a user creates a container, the container can be updated with additional tracking numbers with this endpoint.Authorizations:OAuthpath Parameterscontainer-idrequiredstring Container id for the container\nRequest Body schema:

 \nThis API supports the service standards for the number of days between the acceptance and delivery of a piece of mail that the Postal Service™ considers to be timely delivery. Service standards are delivery benchmarks for how long customers can expect for the Postal Service to deliver different types of mail from origin to destination — Point A to Point B. Service standards are not necessarily the same as the actual service performance.ResourcesgetAllows customers to get estimates on delivery standards.getAllows customers to get standards.API docs by RedoclyService Standards (3.1.5)Download OpenAPI specification:DownloadUSPS Support: APISupport@usps.gov Terms of ServiceThis document contains a Reference Guide to the Service Standards API's listed below: \nThis API provides estimated delivery standard information for ZIP Code™s with 3 or 5 digits, while taking into account non-delivery days.It covers multiple mail classes, such as Priority Mail Express®, Priority Mail Express® (for live animals), Priority Mail®, First-Class Mail® Letters, First-Class Mail® Flats, First-Class Mail® Cards, USPS Ground Advantage™, Bound Printed Matter, First Class Mail®, Library Mail, Media Mail®, Parcel Select®, and Parcel Select Lightweight®.To utilize this API, users need to refer to Pub 199 for Service Type Codes.Authentication, Authorization and Access Control\nClient applications are given authorized access to protected information resources.Authorization is accomplished via the USPS® Customer Onboarding Platform, where Customer Registration users may grant applications access to their protected business information.All client applications must go through this onboarding process.Any Customer Registration user wishing to share their protected business information with client application(s) may also grant authorized access.The OAuth2, version 3 (/v3) API is based on this authorization grant and must be used to get tokens for all V3 APIs.The resulting OAuth2 access token is to be placed in the Authorization header, using the Bearer authentication scheme.This is like what is done for all version 1 (/v1) APIs.All version 3 APIs validate access to protected information resources and will respond with a 401 HTTP status, Unauthorized reason, when the client application has not been authorized to access the given information resource.Publication 199\nResourcesAllows customers to get estimates on delivery standards.Allows customers to get estimates on delivery standards between 3 or 5 digit ZIP Code™s for the selected mail

apisupport@usps.gov Terms of ServiceThe Intelligent Mail Container barcode (IMcb) provides visibility at the mail aggregate level.It is used on mailer-generated pallet labels to uniquely identify pallets and similar containers (i.e. All Purpose Containers, hampers, pallet boxes, etc.) in addition to identifying the mail owner and, it provides a link between the electronic mailing record and the physical mail aggregate.The IMcb uniquely identifies the mail owner, mail preparer, or consolidator by way of the Mailer ID field.Furthermore, the IMcb establishes a unique \"serial number\" for each container.These two features allow each container to be associated with a unique mailing and facilitate tracking of containers as they are loaded and unloaded from transportation.The IMcb is printed on Mailer-generated pallet labels and is designed to be scanned at acceptance and at other points throughout the transportation and processing network.Other human-readable data elements, beyond the IM Container barcode, such as text identifying the mail owner, destination, and type of mail are also required on the container placard.Further information on the use of this barcode can be found in the Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service®, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM 300).ResourcesAdd packages or mail to a container manifest.When a user creates a container, the container can be updated with additional tracking numbers with this endpoint.Authorizations:OAuthpath Parameterscontainer-idrequiredstring Container id for the container\nRequest Body schema:

published rates please refer to the USPS Price List\nTo discover the rate ingredients for this API, take a look at Publication 205.Authentication, Authorization and Access Control\nClient applications are given authorized access to protected information resources.Authorization is accomplished via the USPS Customer Onboarding Platform, where Customer Registration users may grant applications access to their protected business information.All client applications must go through this onboarding process.Any Customer Registration user wishing to share their protected business information with client application(s) may also grant authorized access.The OAuth2, version 3 (/v3) API is based on this authorization grant and must be used to get tokens for all V3 APIs.The resulting OAuth2 access token is to be placed in the Authorization header, using the Bearer authentication scheme.This is similar to what is done for all version 1 (/v1) APIs.All version 3 APIs validate access to protected information resources and will respond with a 401 HTTP status, Unauthorized reason, when the client application has not been authorized to access the given information resource.The following APIs may

205.Authentication, Authorization and Access Control\nClient applications are given authorized access to protected information resources.Authorization is accomplished via the USPS® Customer Onboarding Platform, where Customer Registration users may grant applications access to their protected business information.All client applications must go through this onboarding process.Any Customer Registration user wishing to share their protected business information with client application(s) may also grant authorized access.The OAuth2, version 3 (/v3) API is based on this authorization grant and must be used to get tokens for all V3 APIs.The resulting OAuth2 access token is to be placed in the Authorization header, using the Bearer authentication scheme.This is like what is done for all version 1 (/v1) APIs.All version 3 APIs validate access to protected information resources and will respond with a 401 HTTP status, Unauthorized reason, when the client application has not been authorized to access the given information resource.The following APIs may include payment account or permit identification used to get contract rates.If all mail classes are needed, please use the /total-rates/search endpoint.ResourcesPerforms a search for base price using the submitted rate ingredients.Returns an eligible price given a set of package rate

 \nThis API supports the service standards for the number of days between the acceptance and delivery of a piece of mail that the Postal Service™ considers to be timely delivery. Service standards are delivery benchmarks for how long customers can expect for the Postal Service to deliver different types of mail from origin to destination — Point A to Point B. Service standards are not necessarily the same as the actual service performance.ResourcesgetAllows customers to get estimates on delivery standards.getAllows customers to get standards.API docs by RedoclyService Standards (3.1.5)Download OpenAPI specification:DownloadUSPS Support: APISupport@usps.gov Terms of ServiceThis document contains a Reference Guide to the Service Standards API's listed below: \nThis API provides estimated delivery standard information for ZIP Code™s with 3 or 5 digits, while taking into account non-delivery days.It covers multiple mail classes, such as Priority Mail Express®, Priority Mail Express® (for live animals), Priority Mail®, First-Class Mail® Letters, First-Class Mail® Flats, First-Class Mail® Cards, USPS Ground Advantage™, Bound Printed Matter, First Class Mail®, Library Mail, Media Mail®, Parcel Select®, and Parcel Select Lightweight®.To utilize this API, users need to refer to Pub 199 for Service Type Codes.Authentication, Authorization and Access Control\nClient applications are given authorized access to protected information resources.Authorization is accomplished via the USPS® Customer Onboarding Platform, where Customer Registration users may grant applications access to their protected business information.All client applications must go through this onboarding process.Any Customer Registration user wishing to share their protected business information with client application(s) may also grant authorized access.The OAuth2, version 3 (/v3) API is based on this authorization grant and must be used to get tokens for all V3 APIs.The resulting OAuth2 access token is to be placed in the Authorization header, using the Bearer authentication scheme.This is like what is done for all version 1 (/v1) APIs.All version 3 APIs validate access to protected information resources and will respond with a 401 HTTP status, Unauthorized reason, when the client application has not been authorized to access the given information resource.Publication 199\nResourcesAllows customers to get estimates on delivery standards.Allows customers to get estimates on delivery standards between 3 or 5 digit ZIP Code™s for the selected mail classes.When requesting estimates for USPS_GROUND_ADVANTAGE two estimates will be returned (one for packages greater than or equal to a pound and one for packages less than a pound, this will be

supported at this time.Ignore the Content-Encoding header in the second part, the label image file.The contents of this part are not compressed.Ignore the Content-Transfer-Encoding header in the second part, the label image file.The contents of this part are always Base64 encoded.Instructions\n  Extract the first part of the multipart response as application/json media type.Extract the second part of the multipart response and Base64 decode it to yield the binary image file.Save the binary image file, given the Content-Type header value and the filename of this part (e.g.application/pdf,
