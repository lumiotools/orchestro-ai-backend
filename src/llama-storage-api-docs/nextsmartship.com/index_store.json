The first step is to click on UPDATE MAPPING button.\n\n \n \nSecondly, you should select the extra items you need and click on ADD. Once you confirm the units for that bundle set pls kindly click on OK.

the second option after \"home\"\n\n\nBy clicking on \"complete product info\", to the right of \"settings\".\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIncomplete products show an indicator \"New\" under the status tab while completed products should show an indicator \"Normal\" under the status tab.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nProducts that haven't synchronized, can manually be added by clicking on \"create\" at the top right corner of the screen and filling in all the information that is required.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nInventory: This shows how much inventory is stored in our warehouse, take note this only shows warehouse inventory and not Shopify inventory.\n\n\nAction tab: This shows all actions that can be done to your products.\n\n\nThe \"eye\" action button allows the user to view products. The \"pencil\" icon is used to edit your product information. The pencil icon has two color indicators. Grey/white means that the product is incomplete, and blue meaning that the product information has been completed.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHow to fill in the information after clicking the \"pencil\" icon in the Action tab:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBasic Information:\n\n\nIn the basic information, you can add \"product images, SKU, English, and Chinese names, the HS code, declaration value, and the weight \" of your products. The asterisk * signals information that shouldn't be left blank.\n\n\n \n\n\nProduct Images:\n\n\nIf you would like to beautify your Fulfillship application you can add images. If you already have the product image added on Shopify, the images will automatically synchronize.\n\n\n \n\n\nSKU name:\n\n\nEvery product in the Fulfillship application needs an SKU name, this is a special name for your product that identifies it or differentiates it from other products with similar attributes. The SKU name can be alphanumeric or words alone, but can't be standalone numbers and shouldn't include special characters such as \"~!@#$%^&*()_-=+\\|;/?[]{}\"\n\n\n \n\n\nEnglish and Chinese names:\n\n\nEvery product in our system requires an English and a Chinese name to help identify it better, for situations where you're unsure of what name to give your product in Chinese, you can use \"Google translate or Baidu translate\" or any translation tool and the naming error will be bypassed.\n\n\n \n\n\nHS Code:\n\n\nThe HS code (Harmonized system code) is a special set of numbers in foreign trade that allows custom officers to trace the kinds of products being exported and imported. Mostly the declaration value of your product is compared with the product type being exported before the product can be allowed into or out of a country. You can ask customer services to assist with it if you're unsure of your HS code.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeclaration Value:","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":5580,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hwCO8MB2D4ZeZWwZnoW1lwvvP2jrJo6M2ura+qTTIRE="},"3242a449-c2da-44dd-9297-2bf21ffeaa52":{"id_":"3242a449-c2da-44dd-9297-2bf21ffeaa52","metadata":{"url":"https://support.nextsmartship.com/add-products-to-oms"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"82eb6fcb-ad3f-440d-bd18-0228edd8b9be","metadata":{"url":"https://support.nextsmartship.com/add-products-to-oms"},"hash":"oDOMRaIufD5vUN2beBP272G4KdP5TRneqojJE+NgrNo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1d469cb0-9975-46f9-b444-55493a9ce655","metadata":{"url":"https://support.nextsmartship.com/add-products-to-oms"},"hash":"T2Snr3/tkvRc00VKfITsgntzh7JxmCEVBv9BLgBZmPk="}},"text":"English and Chinese names:\n\n\nEvery product in our system requires an English and a Chinese name to help identify it better, for situations where you're unsure of what name to give your product in Chinese, you can use \"Google translate or Baidu translate\" or any translation tool and the naming error will be bypassed.\n\n\n \n\n\nHS Code:\n\n\nThe HS code (Harmonized system code) is a special set of numbers in foreign trade that allows custom officers to trace the kinds of products being exported and imported.

You can ask customer services to assist with it if you're unsure of your HS code.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeclaration Value:\n\n\nIs the base for which Tax/VAT will be levied on your product, a certain proportion of your TAX/VAT will be charged based on your declaration value. It is advisable to declare truthfully as when the declared value is too high, you can get taxed more than if it's low, but if the declared value is too low, your products can get confiscated giving you a penalty. A good balance is to look at your buying and selling costs and to place the value as either one of them or just in between the buying and selling cost, if products are lost in transit compensation is given back based on your declared value+shipping cost.\n\n\n \n\n\nWeight:\n\n\nThe weight can be set according to grams. The weight will be used as an estimate and the real weight will be updated in the system as soon as your products have completed the warehouse receiving process.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBarcode Settings:\n\n\nIn this section all that you would be filling is whether your product has;\n\n\n\nA barcode（If you have custom barcodes select yes and add it in the barcode area）\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nDoesn't have a barcode (if you have no barcode you can select no and generate one using the \"generate barcode\" option) or you can create one by yourself that is in the range of 11-16 alphanumeric letters.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLogistics Attributes:\n\n\nThe logistics attributes describe the type of goods your product belongs to, selectable options are; Normal, Electric, and Sensitive (Cosmetic, Liquid, and Magnetic).\n\n\n \n\n\nPlease choose with caution because when you declare your product as a normal product it will automatically match with normal shipping lines and if it uses a normal shipping line but upon further inspection turns out to be an electronic or cosmetic product. You can be fined or your product can risk being confiscated by customs officers.\n\n\n \n\n\nNormal:\n\n\nThis means your products belong to normal products such as clothing, bottles, bags, and other general products for day-to-day activities.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nElectric:\n\n\nThis means your products are classified as either; electronic products with a built-in battery, electronic products with a removable battery, or just a general battery itself.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSensitive:\n\n\nThis means your products are classified as either cosmetic, liquid, or magnetic products.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClick save after completing everything.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articlesReceiving ProductsWhat is WRO(Warehouse Receiving Order)?SKU Mapping for Shopify SellersInventory TransfersDispose of Inventory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit A Ticket\nGet Your Fulfillment Solution","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":4815,"endCharIdx":8266,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rQoIZhCdh/9+IMM7W9QUluk1OrcB+/WKHSqtWarmtyI="},"609e624f-cb5f-4ad0-9c36-72f025578473":{"id_":"609e624f-cb5f-4ad0-9c36-72f025578473","metadata":{"url":"https://support.nextsmartship.com/add-insurance-to-shipments"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"10750f82-5efd-413e-b068-c2d9fe9ee236","metadata":{"url":"https://support.nextsmartship.com/add-insurance-to-shipments"},"hash":"oGCE+x367T9KrvjmbclPuh+XKu3gcSfTkZ0a2Kf5tzA="}},"text":"Add Insurance to Shipments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Help Center\n      \n\n\nSubmit A Ticket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n                \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n                \n                Action on Order\n                \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Get Started\n            \n\n\n\n                  General Information\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n              Integration & API\n            \n\n\n\n                  Integration with Shopify\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n              Inventory & Products\n            \n\n\n\n                  Products & Product Details\n                \n\n\n\n                  Inventory Items\n                \n\n\n\n                  WRO (Warehouse Receiving Orders)\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n              Orders & Shipments\n            \n\n\n\n                  Lost and Damaged Shipments\n                \n\n\n\n                  Action on Order\n                \n\n\n\n                  General Information\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n              Pricing\n            \n\n\n\n                  Pricing\n                \n\n\n\n                  Billing\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n              FAQ\n            \n\n\n\n                  Order Issues\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to home\n\n\n\n\nHelp Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrders & Shipments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction on Order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Get Started\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            General Information\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Integration & API\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Integration with Shopify\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Inventory & Products\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Products & Product Details\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Inventory Items\n          \n\n\n\n\n            WRO (Warehouse Receiving Orders)\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Orders & Shipments\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Lost and Damaged Shipments\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Action on Order\n          \n\n\n\n\n            General Information\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Pricing\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Pricing\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Billing\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Order Issues\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Insurance to Shipments\nInsurance to lost and damaged shipments\nShipments lost, delay or with wrong items shipped out can have a major impact on your business.
