Therefore, if you are using a shipping platform other than the Metapack Platform, you will use the data ingest operations of the Tracking API to push data from your shipping platform to the API. \nGetting an API key\nYou must request an API key from your Metapack Professional Services implementation consultant.\nAn API key is sent by encrypted email to the email address specified in an API key request. The messsage includes your username, password, key, and secret.\nYou can request a single API key for all Tracking API requests. Alternatively, you can request two API keys so that you can use one API key for all data ingest requests (deliveries and delivery legs) and another key for all data retrieval requests (parcel journeys). Using two API keys with the Tracking API is recommended because API key-level quotas apply to data retrieval requests.\nBy default, your API key(s) provide(s) access to our sandbox environment.\nMaking API requests\nAuthentication\nThe Tracking API uses TLS authentication and the HTTP basic access authentication method.\nTo authenticate yourself to the API, you must include an Authorization header in each API request, which comprises the Basic prefix followed by a Base64-encoded <username>:<password> string .\n\n\nCopy\nCopied\n\ncurl --request HTTP_VERB \\ \n--url \"https://API_BASE_ADDRESS_AND_ENDPOINT\" \\ \n--header \"Authorization: Basic Base64-encoded <username>:<password>\" \\\n\nThe Tracking API uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) to provide secure connections. Therefore, you must use HTTPS for all direct communication between your systems or apps and the API.\nSandbox environment\nThe Tracking API is available in the following sandbox environment:\n\nhttps://api.sbx.metapack.com/tracking/v1\n\nYou can use the sandbox environment until you are ready to move to our production environment. To get your API key to access our production environment, you must contact your Metapack Professional Services implementation consultant.\nVersions\nThe base URLs of all Tracking API resources are versioned. The API uses URI versioning as follows:\n\nMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\n\nThese versions are as follows.\n\n\n\nVersion\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMajor\nThe version number used in the URI. It denotes breaking changes to the API. Any previously existing URIs should continue to operate as before, returning resources that conform to their original schemas.\n\n\nMinor, Patch\nThese are communicated in the API changelog to inform clients about new features, deprecated features, or bug fixes.\n\n\n\nQuotas\nThe Tracking API is implemented with API key-level quotas for data retrieval requests. The quota is defined in your commercial contract and specifies the maximum number of retrieval requests that you can make each month. Where possible, you will need to ensure that you remain within this limit.\nWhen a quota is reached, the API returns status code 429 (Too Many Requests).\nRate limits\nThe Tracking API supports API key-level rate limiting, so it enforces a limit on the number of requests that clients can make.\nThe standard rate limit of the Tracking API is 10 requests per second per API key.\nWhen a rate limit is reached, the API returns status code 429 (Too Many Requests).\nMake your first API request\nYour first Tracking API request will depend on the shipping platform being used:\n\n\nIf you are using the Metapack Platform, go to the API and use an API key and cURL and an order reference and/or a tracking identifier to \nretrieve a parcel journey\n.\n\n\nAlternatively, if you are using another shipping platform, go to the API and use an API key and cURL to \ncreate a delivery\n or a \ndelivery leg\n.\n\n\nIf you are more comfortable using an API developer platform like Postman, check out how to configure Postman to interact with the API.\nNext steps\nNow that you’re successfully making authenticated requests to the Tracking API with your API key(s), there are different paths that you can take to become more familiar with the API.\n\n\n\nIf you want to…\nSee…\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand how the API works\nTracking orders and parcels, Supported tracking events, and Supported carriers\n\n\nLearn how to use the API\nGuides\n\n\nDownload the OpenAPI specification\nTracking API v1 (YAML)\n\n\nReview the API endpoints\nReference","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4716,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gMh3JzOJdiIOI1Q4MlbU7UY/HhD3+w77MHuBn2FoOyE="},"2f693045-5b98-4d44-b43b-7948d6253978":{"id_":"2f693045-5b98-4d44-b43b-7948d6253978","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/tracking/get-started/tracking-api-quick-start/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f15efe06-a30d-4560-be35-17c2ef1ddba9","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/tracking/get-started/tracking-api-quick-start/"},"hash":"ErzymqSATMUc2eiZp32d1O8+vmDnajeYOMGgcfpaYwU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"73480258-a894-4698-a12a-d05cc8d83afb","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/tracking/get-started/tracking-api-quick-start/"},"hash":"pA4SJ/CCwI0uxRD1AvQoQKrTT/Oru+ctaeWTJjgQTiE="}},"text":"Alternatively, if you are using another shipping platform, go to the API and use an API key and cURL to \ncreate a delivery\n or a \ndelivery leg\n.\n\n\nIf you are more comfortable using an API developer platform like Postman, check out how to configure Postman to interact with the API.\nNext steps\nNow that you’re successfully making authenticated requests to the Tracking API with your API key(s), there are different paths that you can take to become more familiar with the API.\n\n\n\nIf you want to…\nSee…\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand how the API works\nTracking orders and parcels, Supported tracking events, and Supported carriers\n\n\nLearn how to use the API\nGuides\n\n\nDownload the OpenAPI specification\nTracking API v1 (YAML)\n\n\nReview the API endpoints\nReference\n\n\nOn this pageBefore you beginGetting an API keyMaking API requestsAuthenticationSandbox environmentVersionsQuotasRate limitsMake your first API requestNext stepsNext to Configuring PostmanResourcesMetapack.comCarrier LibrarySupportAPIsShippingTrackingCopyright © Metapack Limited 2021-2022.

Online shoppers want it all – fast and flexible delivery in a range of formats, from home delivery and collection point, through to pick-up in store. And as retailers seek to expand their reach into new markets, these requirements become all the more divergent and complex.\nThe challenge falls to operational teams to deliver each customer’s individual version of convenience, while scaling to serve no matter where they are located. Achieving this without undue loss of time and resources is extremely difficult. Even the smallest mistake or delay can quickly send the entire customer promise into disarray.

It is a placeholder entity created by a seller while an order is processed and before the parcels are allocated to a carrier. It contains the necessary information required for the delivery of an order. It enables a seller to provide pre-allocation events to describe its operational process by means of a delivery event. It enables accessing the pseudo parcel journey for this order using the order reference access pattern supported in the retrieve parcel journeys endpoint.\nDepending on your needs, you can create a single delivery or multiple deliveries to represent an order.\nThe benefits of creating deliveries include the following:\n\n\nReassuring shoppers that their orders are progressing.\n\n\nReducing pre-ship WISMO contacts, especially when delivery lead-times are long or delayed.\n\n\nDisplaying product information in your tracking application and notifications communications, which can reduce early queries and reinforce branding.\n\n\nTrack parcels after allocation by means of a delivery leg\nAs soon as a parcel is allocated, you can use the API to create a delivery leg to start tracking the parcel from despatch to delivery. At least one delivery leg per parcel in an order must be created.\nA delivery leg is a stage of the parcel journey defined by a single tracking identifier, such as a barcode. It is created after the carrier is known. It contains the necessary information for the delivery of a parcel and the information about the carrier delivering the parcel, so that the parcel journey can be accessed using the trackingIdentifier access pattern to supplement the order reference access pattern supported in the retrieve parcel journeys endpoint. It enables a seller to provide events after the parcel is allocated to a carrier to describe its operational process by means of a delivery leg event.\nA delivery leg can be a full end-to-end parcel journey if the parcel is handled by a single carrier. Alternatively, it can represent one leg of many for things, such as over-labelling or parent-child consolidation.\nLinking orders with their parcels\nWhen orders are provided by means of deliveries and parcels by means of one or more delivery legs, all of this information is unified within the corresponding parcel journeys using unique delivery references that link deliveries to their respective delivery legs.\nThe benefits of linking deliveries and delivery legs:\n\n\nOrders with rich product information can be provided directly from an order management system.\n\n\nParcels with carrier information can be provided directly from a warehouse management system.\n\n\nParcel journeys unify this information to provide a rich tracking experience.\n\nOn this pageTrack orders prior to allocation by means of a deliveryTrack parcels after allocation by means of a delivery legLinking orders with their parcelsNext to Supported use casesResourcesMetapack.comCarrier LibrarySupportAPIsShippingTrackingCopyright © Metapack Limited 2021-2022.

week agoSupported tracking events\nLearn about how tracking events help you and your customers understand the current status of an order.\nThe Tracking API supports the following types of tracking events:\n\n\nShipping events\n\n\nOrder events\n\n\nReturn events\n\n\nNoteSome exception messages contain the token {brandName}. This token serves as a placeholder and will be replaced with the corresponding brand from your parcel journey. If the brand has not been supplied and is therefore unavailable the token will be returned and will need to be replaced by the application.\nShipping events\nAfter a carrier has been selected for a shipment, you can start receiving shipping events from the carrier. These let you know the current shipping status of a parcel. This starts with a shipment being ready for collection by the carrier from the specified warehouse (shipping location).\nEach carrier uses its own terminology to describe a shipping event. Some carriers use thousands of categories while other carriers use hundreds, but every carrier does things differently. This means that when reviewing tracking data from different carriers, it can become difficult to understand the delivery status of a shipment. \nTo help remove this confusion and to reduce complexity, the Tracking API maps all carrier events into 80 normalised terms that are easier to understand for your support agents and your shoppers.\nYou can use the shipping event codes below when adding events for a delivery leg.\n\n\n\nShipping event code \nStatus code \nEvent category \nDescription / Exception message\n\n\n\n\nAWAITING_DESPATCH\nPROCESSING\nHAPPY\nReady for despatch\n\n\nDESPATCHED\nPROCESSING\nHAPPY\nDespatched by retailer\n\n\nNOT_YET_RECEIVED_BY_CARRIER\nPROCESSING\nEXCEPTION_INFO\nWarehouse processing delay There was an issue with your order leaving the warehouse.

aggregator is a third-party broker that buys carriage rates and services from different carriers for resale.\n\nC\nCarrier\nA carrier is a third-party logistics provider that contracts with the seller or shipper for delivery services.\nCarriers use their own or sub-contracted delivery networks to deliver parcels from collection points to delivery or collection points.\nNoteIf you use the Metapack Platform for shipping, your choice of carriers and carrier services will depend on when you became a Metapack customer and the pricing plan to which you are subscribing.From June 2021 onwards, new Metapack customers using the Platform must select a pricing bundle.New customers subscribing to the Enterprise plan can choose from more than 300 carriers. Alternatively, if you are subscribing to the Essentials plan or to the Professional plan, you can choose from a subset of those carriers.\nCartonisation\nThis refers to division of an \"outer\" or \"parent\" consignment, such as a pallet, into \"inner\" or \"child\" consignments (\"cartons\"), which are then linked to the parent for tracking purposes.\nConsignment\nA shipment that is handled by a (common) carrier.\nCRM (software)\nCustomer Relationship Management application. A technology used to manage interactions with customers and potential customers. \n\nD\nDelivery\nA delivery is a placeholder entity created by a seller before the order is processed, the carrier is identified, and the parcels are allocated.\nIt is created before the tracking identifier is known and contains the necessary information required for the delivery of an order. It enables sellers to provide pre-allocation events to describe their operational process before the parcel(s) are collected by the carrier.\nIt requires a unique delivery reference (deliveryRef), which is unique to the seller, and the order reference (orderRef) of the related order.\nDelivery event\nA delivery event is an event published by a seller that relates to the status of a delivery pre-allocation. For example, “order is being processed”, or “awaiting payment”, and so on.\nA delivery event requires the unique delivery reference that identifies the delivery related to this event.\nWhen a seller retrieves the parcel journey by the order reference used in the delivery, the parcel journey will include all published delivery events as tracking events in the tracking history.\nDelivery leg\nA delivery leg is a stage of the parcel journey defined by a single tracking identifier.\nIt contains the necessary information for the delivery of a parcel and the information about the carrier delivering the parcel.\nIt can be full end-to-end parcel journey if the delivery scenario is for a single parcel, single carrier, or single leg. Alternatively, it can represent one leg of many for things, such as over-labelling or parent/child consolidation.\nDelivery leg event\nA delivery leg event for a trackable item, such as a parcel that relates to the status of a parcel post-allocation.\nIt requires a tracking identifier that identifies the parcel.\nDelivery leg events can be used to update the status of a parcel when it is ready to collect in a store or at a pickup point.\n\nE\neCommerce platform\nSoftware that enables online businesses to:\n\n\nBuild or manage their websites (online stores).\n\n\nUse search engine optimisation (SEO) tools.\n\n\nConnect to social media platforms for marketing, sales, and operations.\n\n\nAn eCommerce platform is also the consumer facing front end where shoppers view their order information, including tracking.\n\nI\nItem\nItems are components of a product. One or many items can constitute a product.\nWarehouse management systems or other operational platforms record items by SKUs (stock-keeping units) to ensure that all \"parts\" or \"items\" that form a product are available and shipped as part of the product as part of the order.\n\nM\nManifest\nA document that describes individual orders contained within a shipment. It is not a legal document but is created for record purposes.\nA manifest usually covers an entire load regardless of whether the load is to be delivered to a single destination or many destinations.\nA typical manifest will contain details about the following:\n\n\nGoods being shipped\n\n\nShipper\n\n\nConsignee\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nMeasurements\n\n\nPacking\n\n\nOrigin and destination\n\n\nDocument number","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4715,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"s7vgjWRBYUaG9S23Fjsjga8hp/RJOhlotmOo74J1qg0="},"d6963722-abe5-4f2f-b61d-cf8cc7dfdafc":{"id_":"d6963722-abe5-4f2f-b61d-cf8cc7dfdafc","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/tracking/basics/tracking-api-glossary/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"4ab9ad6a-f437-4e21-8810-c001ca326168","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/tracking/basics/tracking-api-glossary/"},"hash":"nb7wbOnvpMsFoA6pUn0H5Z6k9bPzGcwTWRz/tMqHH7s="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e457b87f-864f-4522-a1df-11fadba31b18","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/tracking/basics/tracking-api-glossary/"},"hash":"fubKQG7oaz4hwT8yj5t2f+xU+Zt/0kSJQ5XOCS+Tb+M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"941e3e3a-43dc-4484-a953-09919aab8af9","metadata":{},"hash":"B5i4Kr/ILidTm/GgvmIf6iqo0eIroTXoMO8MGXDvGJA="}},"text":"Connect to social media platforms for marketing, sales, and operations.\n\n\nAn eCommerce platform is also the consumer facing front end where shoppers view their order information, including tracking.\n\nI\nItem\nItems are components of a product.

This means that each leg has a different and unique tracking identifier (barcode). Each leg also has a start and end location and will attract a “delivered” or final tracking event.\nHowever, the seller will knit the two discrete legs together to visualise the complete journey for the shopper/recipient. The second leg tracking identifier might be known at the initial allocation through parent/child or because both are created at the start.\nMulti-leg can be due to two different carriers delivering a service for the parcel or because of a consolidated injection using a parent-child type model.\n\nO\nOrder\nA shopper places an order with a seller, pays for the contents of the order, and selects one or more delivery services for the order.\nAn order will always go to a single delivery or collection location, but might be shipped from multiple shipping locations.\nAn order contains one or many products shipped in one or many parcels. It might be delivered to the single delivery address by different delivery carriers using different delivery services/speeds, so the contents of the order might have different expected delivery dates.\nOrder management system\nAn order management system (OMS) consolidates orders from all of a seller's sales channels into one place. It also manages stock availability so that that the seller sells only products that are in stock.\nOutbound delivery\nA delivery from a shipper to a recipient location containing the contents of the shopper’s order. The recipient location could be a home, a PUDO/collection point, or a store.\nOccasionally, if delivery fails, an outbound shipment can also end up in a non-delivery or return to sender status and be reverted back to the shipper. However, this is an exception for an outbound delivery and should not to be confused with returned parcels.\nOver-labelling\nThis is where a carrier or aggregator uses the initial tracking identify to locate the data records for the parcel and then overwrites it with a new tracking identifier. This typically occurs when the final mile carrier is not determined at the point of allocation (see aggregator).\nBoth tracking identifiers might attract tracking events, but it will be the second label that will be used for the majority of tracking events, especially the final mile/destination events.\n\nP\nParcel\nParcels contain products (items) from an order. One or many parcels make up an order.\nParcels/packages are collected by carriers and delivered to recipients' homes or their chosen collection points.\nParcel  journey\nA parcel journey covers all tracking events (including one or more delivery legs) for either outbound deliveries (including return to sender for failed deliveries) or returns.\nA seller will request parcel journey(s) for an order, so a parcel journey should include all tracking events for all legs for a single parcel.\nParent-child\nThis refers to the relationship between a parcel and a pallet. \nProduct\nProducts are selected by shoppers and placed in their shopping carts.\nProducts have descriptions to encourage purchase. These descriptions usually include the following information:\n\n\nSize\n\n\nColour\n\n\nModel number\n\n\nImages","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":3731,"endCharIdx":8007,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rWFCv5+V9vKragnUJtn91RmO4zDxj2uHaf+T9A2E2Xk="},"941e3e3a-43dc-4484-a953-09919aab8af9":{"id_":"941e3e3a-43dc-4484-a953-09919aab8af9","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/tracking/basics/tracking-api-glossary/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"4ab9ad6a-f437-4e21-8810-c001ca326168","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/tracking/basics/tracking-api-glossary/"},"hash":"nb7wbOnvpMsFoA6pUn0H5Z6k9bPzGcwTWRz/tMqHH7s="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d6963722-abe5-4f2f-b61d-cf8cc7dfdafc","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/tracking/basics/tracking-api-glossary/"},"hash":"y4fJLFMDROGhIcWyy4R4DDQLdSdhNbbtaDa7WemouBA="}},"text":"Size\n\n\nColour\n\n\nModel number\n\n\nImages\n\n\nA product can be made up of one or many items/SKUs (stock-keeping units).\nPUDO delivery\nDelivery of a seller's products in “parcels” by a carrier from a shipping location to a recipient’s nominated collection point.\nThe collection point can be a manned location, such as a newsagent or supermarket, or an unmanned location, such as a locker.\n\nR\nRecipient\nThe recipient of a delivery. A recipient might not be the shopper who purchased the product(s) from the seller.\nRedirection\nThis is where a home delivery for a specific date fails and the carrier takes alternative action or the delivery is altered by the recipient before the delivery attempt.\nReturn\nThis is where a delivery is collected from a recipient location or is injected into a (returns) collection location containing some or all of the products from the outbound order.\nA return can be initiated by using a pre-supplied label (labels in a box), a standalone returns portal, or a seller’s own returns function embedded in its eCommerce platform (returns on demand).\n\nS\nSeller\nThe organisation from which a shopper purchases products (orders). By purchasing from the seller, the shopper creates a contract with that organisation and can hold it accountable for any delivery problems.\nA shipper might have its own shipping solutions, including a shipping platform, carrier contracts, and so on. Alternatively, it might outsource these to third-party specialists.\nShipper\nThe organisation that is responsible for the warehousing and despatch of the orders to carriers.\nThe roles of shipper and seller can be either performed by the same entity or sub-contracted to a third-party fulfilment organisation.\nA shipper can also refer to the physical location from which \"parcels\" are collected.\nAn order can be sent by multiple shippers.\nShopper\nThe person who purchases a product (or products) from a seller, chooses the delivery method, and specifies the delivery location.\nThe shopper might not be the recipient of the delivery.\n\nT\nTracking event\nA tracking event is the normalised event format for any event related to a parcel.\nIt can be a delivery event, a delivery leg event, or a carrier tracking event.\nThe parcel journey contains the full tracking history related to the delivery of a parcel, which unifies in a normalised format tracking event all the variety of events that have been published for this parcel, pre-allocation, and post-allocation.\nTracking identifier\nTypically, this is a barcode applied to a parcel or lowest tier trackable unit, which could be a pallet if the pallet contains products for an order.\nA barcode is used for \"in-network\" scanning and processing and for sharing tracking updates to sellers or third parties.\nA barcode should be unique to a carrier for a nominated amount of time, but might not be unique across carriers.\n\nW\nWarehouse\nA storage place for products. Principal warehouse activities include receipt of products, storage, shipment, and order picking.\nFor the Metapack Platform, a warehouse is any location used for shipping orders. Example locations include stores, distribution centres, and logistics channels.\nWarehouse management system\nA warehouse management system (WMS) sits within fulfilment location operations to streamline and control all warehousing processes and thus create an efficient operation.On this pageAAggregatorCCarrierCartonisationConsignmentCRM (software)DDeliveryDelivery eventDelivery legDelivery leg eventEeCommerce platformIItemMManifestMulti-legOOrderOrder management systemOutbound deliveryOver-labellingPParcelParcel  journeyParent-childProductPUDO deliveryRRecipientRedirectionReturnSSellerShipperShopperTTracking eventTracking identifierWWarehouseWarehouse management systemNext to Working with Delivery ManagerResourcesMetapack.comCarrier LibrarySupportAPIsShippingTrackingCopyright © Metapack Limited 2021-2022.

PostmanChangelogBasicsTracking orders and parcelsSupported use casesSupported tracking eventsSupported carriersGlossaryWorking with Delivery ManagerWorking with Delivery TrackerWorking with Notifications WebhookGuidesReferenceLast updated 1 week agoWorking with Delivery Manager\nTrack a parcel shipped with Delivery Manager\nIf you are an existing customer of MetaPack and you ship your parcels using Delivery Manager then these parcels will be made available in the Tracking API automatically. The information regarding the parcels would have been provided by the means of a delivery leg(s) via our own internal platform.\nAfter your delivery legs have been created for a given parcel then the parcel journey becomes available and can be retrieved using any of the access patterns that are detailed in the guide Use a safe access pattern to retrieve parcel journeys. Our recommendation is to use the order reference in combination with the tracking identifier. The parcel journey includes all information available in the delivery leg(s) and is enriched with additional information available within MetaPack.\nThe amount of information returned in the Parcel Journeys will depend on the complexity of your shipping with MetaPack. For this guide we will assume that most of your volume is a single parcel order handled by a single carrier. In order to perform this test you should have two pieces of information from the result of a Delivery Manager allocation call available: the orderNumber and trackingCode.\nSteps:\n\n\nOpen the resource \nGET Retrieve the parcel journeys for an order or a parcel\n.\n\n\nIn the tab \nParameters\n, set the value of the query parameter \norderRef\n to your \norderNumber\n from the Delivery Manager allocation call.\n\n\nIn the tab \nParameters\n, set the value of the query parameter \ntrackingIdentifier\n to your \ntrackingCode\n from the Delivery Manager allocation call.\n\n\nRemove all other query parameters so that only the \norderRef\n and \ntrackingIdentifier\n are retained.\n\n\nSend the request to retrieve the parcel journey.\n\n\nExpect a successful response with a \n200 OK\n

Delivery Tracker supports tracking for home delivery, pick-up & drop-off and click & collect. Find out more about Delivery Tracker in Metapack Help Center.\nConsideration when using deliveries in combination with delivery legs\nThe information required for tracking orders and parcels in Delivery Tracker can be provided by means of deliveries and delivery legs.\nDelivery Tracker retrieves the corresponding parcel journeys in order to render the tracking experience.\nAs a parcel journey provides the consolidated view over all the information available for a given order or parcel, the same block of information does not need to be repeated in both the delivery and the delivery leg. The information can be supplied only once from the source that is the most appropriate (OMS, CMS, WMS).\nTrack a home delivery\nWhen you ingest orders and parcels information using Tracking API, you need to provide the following information in order to track the delivery of these orders and parcels to a recipient's home address.\nTracking a home delivery requires:\n\n\nDelivery information:\n\n\nCarrier Service Type: \nTRACKED\n (default) or \nUNTRACKED\n\n\nDirection: \nOUTBOUND\n (default)\n\n\nType: \nHOME\n (default)\n\n\nDelivery window\n\n\n\n\nRecipient address\n\n\nSender address\n\n\nThis information needs to be included alongside the required fields mandated by the API such as order reference, delivery reference, customer reference, tracking identifier and so on.\nIn this example, a Delivery is created to enable the tracking experience in Delivery Tracker while an order is processed and before parcels are allocated to a carrier:\n\n\nCopy\nCopied\n\n{\n  \"deliveryRef\": \"REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-DELIVERY-REF\",\n  \"order\": {\n    \"orderRef\": \"REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-ORDER-REF\",\n    \"customer\": {\n      \"customerRef\":

The only major difference is that the optimal carrier service for a consignment is selected before the consignment is created and allocated.\nSub-workflows\nThe following sub-workflows can be used with any of the supported main workflows:\n\n\nRate shopping\n\n\nStore the paperwork and print later\n\n\nScan to trailer\n\n\nRate shopping\nQuickly verify which carrier services are able to offer the best rates for delivering a proposed consignment within a specified delivery window while also fulfilling other specific criteria.\nStore the paperwork and print later\nGenerate labels and customs documents for allocated consignments. Within each API call, you specify parameters that determine how the paperwork is to be generated. For example, you might have different packing benches for domestic and international consignments.\nSave the Base64-encoded strings for labels and customs documents in separate text files. At the required time, decode the strings by using a Base64 encoder/decoder and then send them to a network printer.\nScan to trailer\nBefore manifesting, assign each consignment to a manifestGroupCode, which is associated with a vehicle trailer. You can then trace a consignment to a specific trailer.\nNoteManifest group codes (trailer identifiers) can be used across multiple carriers. However, you can manifest consignments for only one single carrier/warehouse combination at a time.On this pageMain workflowsShip and releaseShip and holdPre-ship picking optimisationSub-workflowsRate shoppingStore the paperwork and print laterScan to trailerNext to AllocationResourcesMetapack.comCarrier LibrarySupportAPIsShippingTrackingCopyright © Metapack Limited 2021-2022.

These are part of a system of unique identification numbers used by customs authorities throughout the EU.\nAn EORI number is made up of the ISO alpha-2 country code of the relevant EU member state followed by up to 15 digits. Generally, for the UK, a VAT-registered company’s EORI number consists of the prefix GB followed by the company VAT number, and is suffixed with 000.\nFrom 1 January 2021 onwards, you will need an EORI number when moving goods between:\n\n\nGB or IM and the EU\n\n\nGB and NI\n\n\nNoteEORI numbers for GB-NI shipments need to start with XI because GB-NI transactions are treated as domestic transactions. HMRC will send you an XI EORI number automatically if it thinks that you need one.\nGetting an EORI number\nShippers based inside the EU can request an EORI number from the customs authorities in their own countries. In the UK, HMRC handles all EORI number applications.\nIf you do not yet have an EORI number, you will need to complete one of the following forms:\n\n\nVAT-registered\n\n\nNot VAT-registered and exporting\n\n\nNot VAT-registered and importing\n\n\ninfoFor more information about getting an EORI number, go to Get an EORI number (GOV.UK).\nUsing EORI numbers with the Shipping API\nIf you are a business-to-business (B2B) exporter shipping to the territories listed above and you are creating a consignment in the Shipping API, you need to specify the EORINumber for the sender address, such as the warehouse.\nLikewise, if you are a B2B importer shipping from the territories listed above and you are creating a consignment in the Shipping API, you need to specify the EORINumber for the recipient address.\nThe numbers will appear in your customs documentation, manifest files, and live carrier APIs (where applicable), and also in any paperless solutions being used.\nProduct-level information\nTo define consignments for customs purposes, anyone shipping commercial goods into or out of the EU needs to supply information at both parcel and product level.\nFrom 1 January 2021 onwards, you also need to supply the same level of information when moving goods between:\n\n\nGB or IM and the EU\n\n\nGB and NI\n\n\nYou can then generate the required customs documentation.\ninfoParcel- and product-level information are needed whenever you apply for EORI numbers.\nInternational Commercial Terms (Incoterms)\nIncoterms are a series of three-letter combinations published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) that define the trade terms of buyers and sellers in international deliveries.

Adding a parcel to a consignment with status UNALLOCATED will not change the status to another status.A consignment must be in status UNALLOCATED before it can be modified. If the status is ALLOCATED or a later status, delete the allocation of the consignment before modifying it. The consignment can be subsequently reallocated.However, adding or removing parcels or parcel items to or from a consignment does not require the consignment to be in status UNALLOCATED.\nALLOCATED\n\n\nALLOCATED\nThe consignment is allocated to the optimal carrier service associated with your Metapack shipper account. It is possible to generate paperwork for the consignment or a parcel in the consignment.If you have a single-parcel consignment and print its label, the consignment will move from ALLOCATED status to PRINTED or READY TO MANIFEST (whichever is applicable).However, if you have a multi-parcel consignment and print the label for a specific parcel in the consignment, the consignment will remain in ALLOCATED status until labels for all of the parcels in the consignment are printed when the status of the consignment will change to PRINTED or READY TO MANIFEST (whichever is applicable).Adding a parcel to a consignment with status ALLOCATED will not change the status to another status.Deleting the allocation of a consignment will the change status from ALLOCATED back to UNALLOCATED.\nREADY TO MANIFEST PRINTED UNALLOCATED\n\n\nPRINTED\nIf the PRINTED status is activated for your Metapack shipper account, the consignment moves automatically to PRINTED as soon as its labels are generated (printed).The consignment will not be manifested immediately after the labels are generated. This allows you to control when the consignment moves to READY TO MANIFEST.Adding a parcel to a consignment with status PRINTED will change the status back to ALLOCATED until all labels are generated. However, removing a parcel from a consignment does not change the status of the consignment from PRINTED to another status.To change the status to READY TO MANIFEST, flag the consignment as manifest-ready.Generating paperwork for any parcel in a consignment will not change the status from PRINTED to another status.Deleting the allocation of a consignment will the change status from ALLOCATED back to UNALLOCATED.This status applies only to the Ship and hold and Pre-ship picking optimisation workflows and related sub-workflows, such as Store the paperwork and print later.If you want to make use of this status, you must request Metapack to activate it for your Metapack shipper account.\nREADY TO MANIFESTALLOCATEDUNALLOCATED\n\n\nREADY TO MANIFEST\nThe consignment is ready to be shipped. It is still possible to generate paperwork for the consignment or a parcel in the consignment. However, this is the last status where you can add or remove parcels or parcel items.Adding a consignment with status READY TO MANIFEST to a manifest will change the status to MANIFESTED.Adding a parcel to a consignment with status READY TO MANIFEST will change the status back to ALLOCATED until all labels are generated. However, removing a parcel from a consignment does not change the status of the consignment from READY TO MANIFEST to another status.Generating paperwork for any parcel in a consignment will not change the status from READY TO MANIFEST to another status.Flagging the consignment as not (or no longer) manifest-ready will change the status from READY TO MANIFEST to PRINTED.Deleting the allocation of a consignment with status READY TO MANIFEST will change the status back to UNALLOCATED.\nMANIFESTED ALLOCATED PRINTED UNALLOCATED\n\n\nMANIFESTED\nThe consignment has been added to a manifest transmitted to the selected carrier, and the carrier will collect it from the shipping location (warehouse) unless advised otherwise.After a consignment moves to this status, it cannot move back to an earlier status.\nTRACKING\n\n\nTRACKING\nThe consignment is being transported by the carrier and is being tracked.Although this status occurs inside the Metapack Platform, it depends on carrier input.\nCOMPLETED","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4786,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/Nwy84Yds9+QboLoIP09gALxBIf+Cmsr/bJbM7cKr7o="},"c733937e-69e9-4c3a-89d2-fd3c79485b83":{"id_":"c733937e-69e9-4c3a-89d2-fd3c79485b83","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/shipping/basics/consignment-lifecycle/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"29245ce1-015f-4b26-85bc-1296212469aa","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/shipping/basics/consignment-lifecycle/"},"hash":"CGDQflWEPeN34tX9EOx6i+J6gUNyfGB2/LBLBS4MOys="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"af798ead-9b7d-4aa6-b557-84b829fde86e","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/shipping/basics/consignment-lifecycle/"},"hash":"AtHadj3hLfXX8EhoVz7FQ9RVGQ4OYaSzSGlxlqT9zIM="}},"text":"MANIFESTED\nThe consignment has been added to a manifest transmitted to the selected carrier, and the carrier will collect it from the shipping location (warehouse) unless advised otherwise.After a consignment moves to this status, it cannot move back to an earlier status.\nTRACKING\n\n\nTRACKING\nThe consignment is being transported by the carrier and is being tracked.Although this status occurs inside the Metapack Platform, it depends on carrier input.\nCOMPLETED\n\n\nCOMPLETED\nThe consignment has reached its final destination and a recipient has acknowledged delivery.Although this status occurs inside the Metapack Platform, it depends on carrier input.\n\n\n\n\nIrrespective of the shipping workflow used, a consignment in the Metapack Platform can move over and back between some statuses.

Although using the IOSS is not mandatory, it might be the most convenient way to manage this new VAT obligation.\nNoteIf your business is not located in the EU, you will normally need to appoint an EU-established intermediary to fulfil your VAT obligations under the IOSS.\nIOSS scope\nThe IOSS covers business to consumer (B2C) distance sales of goods that are\n\n\nDispatched or transported from outside of the EU at the time they are sold.\n\n\nDispatched or transported in consignments with a value not exceeding EUR 150.\n\n\nNot subject to excise duties, so the IOSS does not apply to alcohol or tobacco products.\n\n\nHowever, you do not need to charge VAT on distance sales of goods to EU consumers if:\n\n\nYou sell several goods to the same buyer and these goods are shipped in a package amounting to more than EUR 150. These goods will be taxed at importation into the relevant EU member state.\n\n\nYour distance sales of goods are facilitated by an electronic interface, such as a marketplace or platform. In this situation, the electronic interface is responsible for the VAT due.\n\n\nIOSS numbers\nIf you want to make use of the IOSS, you will have to do one of the following:\n\n\nGet your own IOSS number if your business makes only direct sales to EU consumers.\n\n\nOr use the IOSS number of any electronic interfaces that you use if your business makes only marketplace or platform sales to EU consumers.\n\n\nOr do both of the above if your business makes both direct and marketplace/platform sales to EU consumers.\n\n\nBefore getting an IOSS number\nBefore you can get your own IOSS number, you must first determine whether you can register for an IOSS number directly or indirectly. The method that you can use will depend on whether your business has any physical operations in any EU member state.\n\n\n\nIOSS registration method\nEU-established online sellers\nNon-EU-established online sellers\n\n\n\n\nDirect\nYou can register for the IOSS in the EU member state where your business is established. An EU-established online seller can also choose to appoint an intermediary to represent it for the purpose of the IOSS, but this is not mandatory.\nYou can register directly only if: Your business is established in a country with which the EU has a VAT mutual assistance agreement.The goods are supplied from that country to the EU. If you meet both of these conditions, you can register directly in the EU member state of your choosing.\n\n\nIndirect\n(Not applicable)\nIn most cases, you must register for the IOSS indirectly through the appointment of an intermediary that you have appointed to represent you, and the EU member state of the registration will be the member state where the intermediary has established its business.\n\n\n\nEach online seller that wants to make use of the IOSS needs to have only one IOSS number.\nIf an online seller sells goods through marketplaces or platforms that are also IOSS-registered, the IOSS number of the electronic interface used for a transaction should be used for any shipments relating to that transaction.\nGetting an IOSS number\nTo get an IOSS number for your business:\n\n\nGo to the website of the tax authority of an EU member state and find the IOSS/VAT OSS registration section (example: \nIreland\n). The tax authority website that you select depends on whether you must register for IOSS indirectly or you have the option to register directly.\n\n\nSelect direct or indirect registration, as applicable.\n\n\nProvide details about your business.\n\n\nProvide details about any previous VAT OSS tax reference numbers assigned to your business.\n\n\nAfter registration, you will be issued an IOSS identification number, which is valid for all distance sales of imported goods made to buyers in the EU.\nwarningYou should keep your IOSS number confidential.\nIOSS-related API parameters\nFor the IOSS, the Shipping API supports capturing the following values (all at consignment level).\n\n\n\nParameter \nDescription","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":4856,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"zBQet3yY0OXNG2FVmOwz24VPYE4ZB6n/hfRObFulflM="},"46561e9e-f475-4a37-8cc6-99f2f330ff73":{"id_":"46561e9e-f475-4a37-8cc6-99f2f330ff73","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/shipping/basics/eu-vat-collection/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ba044e51-e653-4e60-a6e6-f4c924de08f7","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/shipping/basics/eu-vat-collection/"},"hash":"WBCH1ATHEIao4N2d+nmEA8isxFRssdJl3xWmdpylru4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6a048b86-1090-48c8-98cf-65b6f5ea4a45","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/shipping/basics/eu-vat-collection/"},"hash":"0ND65l/N7wd0Qy6SyjVVB3R/WIxuCz00BUMwSzxRbiI="}},"text":"Go to the website of the tax authority of an EU member state and find the IOSS/VAT OSS registration section (example: \nIreland\n).

It must be provided at consignment level, not at account level. If carriers require IOSS information at parcel level, the IOSS number of a consignment will be applied to each parcel in that consignment.\nFrom 1 July 2021 onwards, the absence or presence of an IOSS number in the details of a shipment will probably be significant for most carriers:\n\n\nThe presence of a valid IOSS number will generally be regarded as a declaration that VAT has been collected and that the IOSS will be used to pay VAT to the relevant tax authority.\n\n\nThe absence of an IOSS number might be regarded as an indicator that VAT should be collected at the point of import into the EU.\n\n\nwarningMetapack will not validate any IOSS numbers or check the EUR 150 IOSS threshold. If a carrier validates an IOSS number, it might check only the minimum length of the number.On this pageEU Import One-Stop Shop (IOSS)IOSS scopeIOSS numbersBefore getting an IOSS numberGetting an IOSS numberIOSS-related API parametersNext to GlossaryResourcesMetapack.comCarrier LibrarySupportAPIsShippingTrackingCopyright © Metapack Limited 2021-2022.

The workflow that your organisation uses for fulfilment will determine which of these methods works best for you.\n\nC\nCarrier\nA carrier is a third-party logistics provider that contracts with the seller or shipper for delivery services.\nCarriers use their own or sub-contracted delivery networks to deliver parcels from collection points to delivery or collection points.\nNoteWith the Metapack Platform, your choice of carriers and carrier services will depend on when you became a Metapack customer and the pricing plan to which you are subscribing.From June 2021 onwards, new Metapack customers using the Shipping Platform must select a pricing bundle.New customers subscribing to the Enterprise plan can choose from more than 300 carriers. Alternatively, if you are subscribing to the Essentials plan or to the Professional plan, you can choose from a subset of those carriers.\nCarrier service\nCarriers usually provide different levels of services for domestic and international deliveries.\nYour organisation's contract with each carrier specifies the services to which it subscribes.\nCarrier service group\nFor allocation purposes, the Metapack Platform enables you to group the carrier services to which your organisation subscribes into meaningful \"service groups\".\nFor example, you can group all those services that offer 48-hour delivery into the same \"48-hour\" group. This will enable your organisation to offer the most appropriate services for each consignment.\nConsignment\nA shipment that is handled by a (common) carrier.\nConsignment lifecycle\nA consignment moves through various statuses before it reaches the recipient(s).\nThe Metapack Platform uses the following consignment statuses:\n\n\nUnallocated\n\n\nAllocated\n\n\nPrinted (if activated for your Metapack shipper account)\n\n\nReady to manifest\n\n\nManifested\n\n\nTracking\n\n\nCompleted\n\n\ninfoFor more information about these statuses, see Consignment lifecycle.\n\nI\nItem\nItems are components of a product. One or many items can constitute a product.\nWarehouse management systems or other operational platforms record items by SKUs (stock-keeping units) to ensure that all \"parts\" or \"items\" that form a product are available and shipped as part of the product as part of the order.\n\nL\nLabel\nA shipping label identifies many things about a consignment or a parcel, including the following:\n\n\nPoint of origin\n\n\nDestination\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nCarrier name\n\n\nLabels are used to determine where your consignment or parcel came from, where it needs to go, and the stops that it might have to make along the way.\nWithout a clear shipping label, a package can be delayed in transit, delivered to the wrong address, or lost, which might lead to either a financial loss or a loss of customer trust.\n\nM\nManifest\nA document that describes individual orders contained within a shipment. It is not a legal document but is created for record purposes.\nA manifest usually covers an entire load regardless of whether the load is to be delivered to a single destination or many destinations.\nA typical manifest will contain details about the following:\n\n\nGoods being shipped\n\n\nShipper\n\n\nConsignee\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nMeasurements\n\n\nPacking\n\n\nOrigin and destination\n\n\nDocument number\n\n\nMetapack shipper account\nAny seller or shipper who wants to use the Metapack Platform must first get an account.\nThe account is used to store the following data:\n\n\nYour organisation's warehouses.\n\n\nCarrier services to which your organisation subscribes.\n\n\nDetails about any users of the platform.\n\n\n\nO\nOrder\nA shopper places an order with a seller, pays for the contents of the order, and selects one or more delivery services for the order.\nAn order will always go to a single delivery or collection location, but might be shipped from multiple shipping locations.\nAn order contains one or many products shipped in one or many parcels. It might be delivered to the single delivery address by different delivery carriers using different delivery services/speeds, so the contents of the order might have different expected delivery dates.\n\nP\nPaperwork\nShipping documents that facilitate international trade.\nIn the Metapack Platform, paperwork can refer to either labels or customs documents or both.\nParcel\nParcels contain products (items) from an order. One or many parcels make up an order.\nParcels/packages are collected by carriers and delivered to recipients' homes or their chosen collection points.\nProduct\nProducts are selected by shoppers and placed in their shopping carts.\nProducts have descriptions to encourage purchase. These descriptions usually include the following information:\n\n\nSize\n\n\nColour\n\n\nModel number\n\n\nImages","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":5182,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"KemaMbiymRT+mSWDXO1LNfo7ZzzloHmoTEOk38V4s4o="},"d87fdff4-e99b-4cc4-b8a8-5dc9e01ff794":{"id_":"d87fdff4-e99b-4cc4-b8a8-5dc9e01ff794","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/shipping/basics/shipping-api-glossary/"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"d8902f1f-25c7-406e-bd1b-d18f9aeacd2b","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/shipping/basics/shipping-api-glossary/"},"hash":"lvx3fKEik6Q3BBQrYM5Gs3mlgFG/2BStfMgwpUiZh5I="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"995b74b0-0d18-40f3-9643-efd599a9b3eb","metadata":{"url":"https://dev.metapack.com/shipping/basics/shipping-api-glossary/"},"hash":"SijLZLPBQrirxcApw5vfj6JNJK7rsW8Y/Nfayfz+PwE="}},"text":"Size\n\n\nColour\n\n\nModel number\n\n\nImages\n\n\nA product can be made up of one or many items/SKUs (stock-keeping units).\n\nR\nRate\nThe price that a shipper is charged by a carrier for the transportation of goods.\nThe main criteria used for determining shipping rates are as follows:\n\n\nTransportation mode(s)\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nMeasurements\n\n\nDistance\n\n\nPoints of pickup and delivery\n\n\nThe goods being shipped\n\n\nRecipient\nThe recipient of a delivery. A recipient might not be the shopper who purchased the product(s) from the seller.\n\nS\nSeller\nThe organisation from which a shopper purchases products (orders). By purchasing from the seller, the shopper creates a contract with that organisation and can hold it accountable for any delivery problems.\nA shipper might have its own shipping solutions, including a shipping platform, carrier contracts, and so on. Alternatively, it might outsource these to third-party specialists.\nShipper\nThe organisation that is responsible for the warehousing and despatch of the orders to carriers.\nThe roles of shipper and seller can be either performed by the same entity or sub-contracted to a third-party fulfilment organisation.\nA shipper can also refer to the physical location from which \"parcels\" are collected.\nAn order can be sent by multiple shippers.\nShipping platform\nAn application or system that consumes details relating to consignments to select the appropriate carrier(s), generate the carrier label, and manifest the consignment to the selected carrier(s).\nDepending on functionality, a shipping platform can be \"dumb\" or \"intelligent\". The Metapack Platform is an intelligent shipping platform.\nShipping rule\nIn the Metapack Platform, shipping rules enable you to search for an optimal subscribed carrier service by using acceptable and unacceptable collection and delivery days and date and time slots, carrier services, delivery location, and other filtering options.\nShopper\nThe person who purchases a product (or products) from a seller, chooses the delivery method, and specifies the delivery location.\nThe shopper might not be the recipient of the delivery.\n\nT\nTracking identifier\nTypically, this is a barcode applied to a parcel or lowest tier trackable unit, which could be a pallet if the pallet contains products for an order.\nA barcode is used for \"in-network\" scanning and processing and for sharing tracking updates to sellers or third parties.\nA barcode should be unique to a carrier for a nominated amount of time, but might not be unique across carriers.\n\nW\nWarehouse\nA storage place for products. Principal warehouse activities include receipt of products, storage, shipment, and order picking.\nFor the Metapack Platform, a warehouse is any location used for shipping orders.

The delivery with the reference DEL-ACCESS-01 is made of two parcels with the references PAR-ACCESS-01 and PAR-ACCESS-02 with each parcel delivered in a single leg that includes its respective tracking identifier TRACK-ACCESS-01 and TRACK-ACCESS-02.\nLet's test the effect of these access patterns when retrieving parcel journeys.\n\n\nOpen the resource \nPOST Create or update a

In such scenario, it is important to retrieve at once all the parcel journeys of the parcels shipped for a given order.\nIn order to retrieve all parcel journeys for a given order, the information about the parcels provided by means of a delivery leg needs to include the order reference that uniquely identifies the order.\nIn this example, an order reference ORDER-01 is shipped by the carrier DHL express using two parcels referenced ORDER-01-PARCEL-01 and ORDER-01-PARCEL-02. Both parcels are tracked under their respective tracking identifiers TRACK-ORDER-01-PARCEL-01 and TRACK-ORDER-01-PARCEL-02\nSteps:\n\n\nOpen the resource \nPOST Create or update a delivery

identifierCancel a delivery for an order or a parcelTrack your returnsReferenceLast updated 1 week agoCancel the delivery for an order or a parcel\nWhen an order is no longer being shipped, the delivery for this order can be cancelled before despatch by means of a delivery event with the event code CANCELLED_BEFORE_DESPATCH.\nWhen a parcel is no longer being shipped, the delivery leg for this parcel can be cancelled before despatch by means of a delivery leg event with the event code CANCELLED_BEFORE_DESPATCH.\nAfter cancelling the delivery for an order or a parcel, the parcel journeys for this order or parcel is no longer returned when using Retrieve parcel journeys in the API.\nCancelling the delivery for an order or a parcel does not delete information. Instead, the parcel journeys that relate to the cancellation are excluded from the response returned by the API.\nThe Tracking API supports the following cancellation types:\n\n\nCancelling an order entirely, which involves sending a cancellation event for each delivery created for the specified order.\n\n\nCancelling a specific delivery for an order, which involves sending a cancellation event for the specific delivery that is cancelled.\n\n\nCancelling a specific parcel, which involves sending a cancellation event using a tracking identifier used to track the parcel. All delivery legs for this parcel will be cancelled automatically and the parcel journey will no longer be available, so there is no need to send a cancellation event for each delivery leg that could have been created for the parcel.\n\n\nNote: When cancelling an order or a delivery, all associated delivery legs that would have been created for the given delivery reference will be cancelled automatically, so there is no need to send additional cancellation events for the delivery legs using the same tracking identifier.\nCancel an order entirely\nThe cancellation of an order is achieved by sending a delivery event with the event code CANCELLED_BEFORE_DESPATCH for each delivery that have been created for the order.\nIn this example, an order with a unique reference ORDER-CANCELLED is cancelled by the customer who no longer wants the items. This order was initially planned to ship the items from two distinct warehouses and as such two deliveries have been created with their respective unique delivery reference DELIVERY-CANCELLED-WAREHOUSE-1 and DELIVERY-CANCELLED-WAREHOUSE-2.\nAs initially planned two delivery legs have been created for the two parcels in the order with their respective tracking identifiers PARCEL-CANCELLED-1 and PARCEL-CANCELLED-2\nTwo delivery event CANCELLED_BEFORE_DESPATCH are published to cancel both deliveries using their unique delivery references.\nSteps:\n\n\nOpen the resource

This parcel reference is used to collect information from delivery legs related to the parcel when querying the parcel journey using either of the tracking identifiers provided by the carriers.\nIn this example, a parcel with a unique parcel reference BOX-001 is delivered by two different carriers. Two delivery legs are created with their respective tracking identifiers and includes the parcel reference BOX-001.

You can decide to delete the obsolete delivery leg by using its tracking identifier. Once deleted, the obsolete delivery leg will no longer be returned in the parcel journey.\nIn this example the tracking identifier of the parcel tracked under TRACK-REALLOC-OBSOLETE changes to TRACK-REALLOC-NEW.

optimisation workflowsCreate and allocate separatelyCreate and allocate simultaneouslyCreate, allocate, and get paperwork simultaneouslyReferenceLast updated 1 week agoVerify whether shipping rules can be applied\nIf the shipping workflow that you are using requires that consignment creation and allocation are separate actions, you can check whether a consignment can be sent using the desired shipping rules. Shipping rules enable you to search for an optimal carrier service by using acceptable and unacceptable collection and delivery days and date and time slots, carrier services, delivery location, and other filtering options.\nNoteThe optimal carrier service will be selected only from the carrier services linked to your Metapack shipper account, not from the entire library of carrier services integrated with the Metapack Platform.\nVerify shipping rules application request\nYou need the following to make a verify shipping rules application request.\n\n\n\nParameter\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nstatus\nUNALLOCATED\nThe consignment lifecycle status.\n\n\n\nUsing the Verify whether shipping rules can be applied operation, enter the

date and time slots, carrier services, delivery location, and other filtering options.Prerequisites: Warehouses, carriers, and carrier services must be configured for your Metapack shipper account.Refer to API setup data.Note: If a suitable subscribed carrier service is not found for the consignment, it will still be created but will remain Unallocated.Tip: To generate
