PHP, Java, JavaScript, Ruby or Go you are more than welcome to jumpstart your integration by using our pre-built official API Wrappers: pyonfleet, php-onfleet, node-onfleet, java-onfleet, ruby-onfleet and gonfleet.Other users have created their own scripts and features to make Onfleet work for them, and we love to see it!If you don’t see the language of your preference here, there may be an unofficial wrappers available through other users' repositories on github.However, we can only support issues with content in the official onfleet github.Do you have an Onfleet API key?If the answer is no, please log on to the Onfleet dashboard with your organization admin email and create an API key.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"caRWlIp0PFDnzvStF6wPEqYgG8u9H+n1zvvWi2KX79Y="},"1c309685-2f88-4b56-af3d-e304e3b895af":{"id_":"1c309685-2f88-4b56-af3d-e304e3b895af","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/setup-tutorial"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"1d3fa085-b38a-42bb-8031-21c3e8d8259f","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/setup-tutorial"},"hash":"uUgJE2VvHxKzumjfHWsYVZBI065rbeJz2GdCOT6GN8o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"949bb71a-aa40-424d-8223-160329ecd680","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/setup-tutorial"},"hash":"caRWlIp0PFDnzvStF6wPEqYgG8u9H+n1zvvWi2KX79Y="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fea4bc3d-a7f0-418e-8d18-3d88d956d9d7","metadata":{},"hash":"jsV3XKB7MPIUETUCSYaIGslLZHSo9WNNVECFp0HUg18="}},"text":"This

to the Onfleet dashboard with your organization admin email and create an API key.📘Testing your API keyOnce you have an API key created, you can test it by hitting our authorization endpoint.Using the API key?To interact with the Onfleet API, you will need to issue an HTTP request and each request will need to be authenticated using the Onfleet API key.Our examples in the documentation are shown in cURL command form, where the commands are executed via a terminal.This is an example of an HTTP request in the form of a cURL command, which includes a <METHOD> and you will need to input your preferred <api_endpoint>, <api_key>, and <body> (optional):\nShellcurl -X <METHOD> \"https://onfleet.com/api/v2/<api_endpoint>\" -u \"<your_api_key>:\" -d \"<body>\"\n\nIf you are not familiar with cURL commands, we recommend using the following tools to send test API requests to Onfleet:\n\nPostman\nInsomnia\n\nWhat is your delivery business model?Everything at Onfleet starts with a task, a task is a single unit of work performed at a destination, and is either a pickup or a dropoff.If you perform deliveries that originate at one pickup location, an order in your e-commerce system can be represented by a single dropoff task in Onfleet.This approach is common for scheduled delivery models like produce, grocery, etc...If you perform unique pickups for each order, then you will need to create two linked tasks in Onfleet to represent the pickup and then the subsequent dropoff.This approach is common for scheduled and on-demand models like laundry and dry cleaning, restaurant, etc...🚧Linked Pickup & DropoffFor businesses creating a pickup/dropoff combo, learn more in linked tasks and task dependencies.How do I create a task?\n\n\nA Task should always have one Destination, which can be created using an address or a set of GPS coordinates. Creating a Destination can be done separately or during task creation. \n\n\nThe Recipient field can be used if someone needs to be informed that the task has started or completed. Recipients receive SMS text notifications and can track driver statuses when properly configured in the dashboard. The recipient field can be left empty. Like Destination, it can be created separately or during task creation. \n\n\nA Task is created and managed by a registered Administrator (either on the dashboard or via the API), and can only be started and completed by a registered Worker (via the Onfleet mobile app).You can decide whether to use more advanced features duringtask creation, including:\n\nTask assignment: automatically or manually\nCreating proof-of-delivery/completion requirements\n\nDo you need any information sent back to your applications?Information can be sent back to your application (ie: order management, e-commerce, customer-facing mobile apps) by utilizing Onfleet Webhooks, where we offer more than 10 event triggers.Do you need custom information stored in Onfleet?If you would like to interact with Onfleet’s API using external identifiers (ie: order numbers, driver’s licenses etc.), or display custom structured data to Onfleet dashboard and mobile app users, you can store custom information on many of Onfleet’s objects using the metadata fields.Learn more about creating and storing custom data using Metadata.How will you validate address information prior to creating tasks in Onfleet?It is critical that your team has accurate address information to successfully perform pickups and deliveries.Onfleet requires a valid destination address or coordinate pair (longitude, latitude) in order to create a task.🚧We highly recommend validating the address information prior to sending it to Onfleet and using a coordinate pair at task creation, ensuring tasks will always be created.When only an address is provided, Onfleet uses Google Maps Javascript API to geocode the address information provided.In cases where your task destination creation fails geocoding, you can follow this troubleshooting guide to find a viable solution.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"BMAdcauWGZJgSdNmaACGeOXtID5vbTyM7Gby1Aat/Oc="},"fea4bc3d-a7f0-418e-8d18-3d88d956d9d7":{"id_":"fea4bc3d-a7f0-418e-8d18-3d88d956d9d7","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/setup-tutorial"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"1d3fa085-b38a-42bb-8031-21c3e8d8259f","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/setup-tutorial"},"hash":"uUgJE2VvHxKzumjfHWsYVZBI065rbeJz2GdCOT6GN8o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1c309685-2f88-4b56-af3d-e304e3b895af","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/setup-tutorial"},"hash":"s1IjZ2OaXYGYbzfu4xJE/pbtGzwI2zOXDa/rQfJnk8M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3a599144-3495-4104-88e9-00826e329917","metadata":{},"hash":"C0iqlGzbUcw1DX/j6Ux4enBly6PDXp/g0P/OXoze16U="}},"text":"If

inaccurate (a generic geographic region or multiple matching results):\nGoogle Developers\nHow will you validate phone numbers prior to creating Recipients?Onfleet utilizes Google's phone validation library to validate all phone inputs, that includes admins, workers, and recipients.In cases where you've encountered a failed request regarding an invalid phone number, it is recommended to set up a failover to capture the failed request and respond properly.Here's a community tool that utilizes the same phone validation library, simply put in a phone number that you wish to test and click submit.The results shown under Validation Results will tell you whether the number is valid or not:\nnull\nWhat proof-of-delivery options do you expect to use?Onfleet offers the following as proof-of-delivery options:\n\nSignature\nPhoto(s)\nBarcode scanning (Premium or above plans)\nID verification (Premium or above plans)\n\nAll of these can be set on the task level depending on your subscribed Onfleet plan, learn more about them in Completion Requirements.👍Ready to roll?Check out our blog post on how to get your first Onfleet task created if you are still having doubts about

Onfleet’s data and real-time delivery management and analytics functionality.All data exchanged between clients and the API is JSON over HTTPS.Note that we will only accept application/json as content type and that the request body, if relevant, must be JSON-encoded.(Note that certain server errors such as 502 and 504 may be returned as HTML, depending on the mode of failure.)The base URL for the Onfleet API is https://onfleet.com/api/v2. \n📘Sample RequestsAll sample requests in this documentation are formatted for cURL, additional examples in Python, Javascript and PHP are obtained from official API wrappers.📘Postman CollectionPostman is a GUI tool for making API requests - This is very useful for learning the Onfleet API or testing requests as you're building an implementation.If

amount of time in seconds that a worker is delayed by, based on the maximum delayTime of all assigned tasks, or null if the worker is not delayed.This is updated every minute if the worker is on-duty, or every 10 minutes if the worker is off-duty.To find out more about delayed statuses, see the delayTime part of our Tasks section or check out this support center entry.imageUrl will also be provided if a worker image has been configured.The required parameters will need to be correctly formatted in order for the request to go through.In cases where duplicated phone numbers are used within your organization, a duplicateKey error will be returned.An address.routing object has the following properties:\nNameTypeDescriptionaddress.routingstringThe destination object id created using the Create

The following promises are kept throughout all endpoints:\n\nWith very few exceptions, numbers are numbers, and not strings. The API adheres strictly to the most natural representation of the underlying data, and null is always returned for optional properties which have not yet been assigned a value.\nDistances fields are displayed in meters measurement unless otherwise noted in the page.\nGeographic coordinates are formatted as [ longitude, latitude ], as per the GeoJSON standard.\nTimestamps are consumed and produced in Unix epoch time format, with millisecond precision, unless otherwise noted. At this time only Driver Time Estimate endpoint is using seconds precision. You can get a sample timestamp in this format on a *nix machine by running the following command.\n\nShell$ echo $(($(date +'%s * 1000 + %-N / 1000000')))\n1455054888000","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":5247,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rw2RaHHP0cAInYOyK4Pbmbu76ALR5c0rKoQlSa/qdAQ="},"582bdc26-e3f6-4d5c-b4ff-e57c087c984a":{"id_":"582bdc26-e3f6-4d5c-b4ff-e57c087c984a","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/data-types-and-response-formats"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"be414c4d-47fb-435f-b97b-4d210066f13f","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/data-types-and-response-formats"},"hash":"Azd6enk1Foh6nRQoM//nhtLhPFyMGAO3S/izWV+H81g="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f7e537da-397a-466e-bbae-35f18ced3626","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/data-types-and-response-formats"},"hash":"QiMrOXQ1yrncGGRyP0dmQG6WJn6sEcHs9/S7sn1U6eA="}},"text":"Most endpoints return the requested target resource, however, there are some exceptions, such as deleting a resource, which will simply respond with a 200 and no body.

If you wish to provide numbers from countries other than your organization's, you must use E.164 only. We strongly recommend the use of libraries like libphonenumber for managing phone number validation and formatting.\nAll outbound traffic from Onfleet will use these IP addresses:

means of dynamically dispatching tasks on the fly.The typical scheduled delivery organization would still use normal RO.Auto-Dispatching is an operation that allows you to dispatch tasks assigned to a team to on-duty drivers.This operation ensures that tasks already assigned to the driver remain with them while automatically interleaving new tasks and potentially re-arranging the driver’s route.All routes return to the team’s hub by default but can be modified.📘Team Auto-Dispatch is a Scale plan or higher feature.Please contact your Onfleet representatives or support for more information.Body Parameters\nNameTypeDescriptionmaxTasksPerRouteIntegerOptional.Total number of tasks allowed on a route.Cannot be negative Integer.Default 100, cannot exceed 200.taskTimeWindowArray of Unix Time in

may either set a task's container for basic assignment functionality (append-only, described below), or interact with the target entity's container directly for advanced assignment functionality.If you omit the container property, the task will be automatically assigned to the creator organization and appear as unassigned in the dashboard.To assign a task to an executing connected organization, use executor instead.The task container property has the following object structure:\nNameTypeDescriptiontypestringThe type of the container to which the task is to be assigned.The possible values are TEAM or WORKER, they must be CAPITALIZEDteamstringIf type is TEAM, the ID of the target team.workerstringIf type is WORKER, the ID of the target worker.You may provide a container property when creating or updating a task to append the task to that container.Since tasks are always in exactly one container until deleted or started, if container is missing, tasks are assigned to their creator organization.In the dashboard, tasks assigned to one's organization are shown as Unassigned.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+tKzelOaajX+CADpfYzJsD9WvH0tDXbIx6BBVkcIjbw="},"fb191f08-9c0b-4013-9712-9856b7bc9585":{"id_":"fb191f08-9c0b-4013-9712-9856b7bc9585","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/manual-assignment"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"35b48e67-d4f8-4d61-8224-70b20a85dde6","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/manual-assignment"},"hash":"CAFpaQtlswZtu4VtJv3VBwz2aZTsdjumI1uZfbUC4Sg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d5fb6706-c0c9-4e8f-99d8-084d2f1cd398","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/manual-assignment"},"hash":"+tKzelOaajX+CADpfYzJsD9WvH0tDXbIx6BBVkcIjbw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"da24f24d-d098-46fd-a09a-6e9117bcf109","metadata":{},"hash":"D0svsc5tvqZFDTZ4TEhRMvreYnKEnCOA37/Zgn2P7Ao="}},"text":"If

JSON blob named override, you should be passing the override parameters as a normal body parameter when creating a task.❗️Override ExceptionThe general override parameter works on the specific task when the parameter is successfully stored, the only exception being recipientSkipSMSNotifications.The condition for recipientSkipSMSNotifications override to work is when the recipient's skipSMSNotification flag is set to false.In summary, if a recipient opted-out to receive SMS notification, task-level override for SMS notifications would not be applied.👍Customizing Map PinsThe appearance object is now supported and is configurable through a triangleColor parameter.\"appearance\": {\"triangleColor\": 1}\nThe triangleColor parameter accepts 3 values: 0 for teal, 1 for orange, and 2 for magenta.📘UnixOnfleet API only accepts time formatted in Unix to the millisecond precision.Any other formats are not accepted and may produce unexpected results.For more information please

PlanGET Route planGET RoutePlan by IDDelete RoutePlanPowered by Route PlanThe Route Plan endpoints allow creating, updating, and deleting Route Plans, in addition to shuffling the tasks within the planned routes and adding more tasks to them.A Route Plan (Route) is a container used to track a driver’s work throughout a shift, day, or planned segment of work (e.g., morning route and afternoon route).Pickup and Delivery tasks are assigned to a Route manually or seamlessly through the Route Optimization process when an Admin or a Dispatcher \"Accepts\" the Route Optimization results.A Route

PlanGET Route planGET RoutePlan by IDDelete RoutePlanPowered by ContainersContainers\nContainers are an abstraction which describes task assignment.A container is an ordered list of tasks.Tasks always belong to exactly one container -- once created and when reassigned.When a task is started by a worker, it is no longer part of that container's tasks.Organizations, teams and workers all correspond to containers as they can all be assigned tasks.The generic way to perform assignment operations is by using a container endpoint.Note that all containers have a hard limit of 10,000 assigned tasks.Conceptually, a container mutation operation allows you to alter the tasks which are in a container, either by setting the list or by inserting new tasks into the list.Note that, in order to ensure the integrity of a container, locking is used.This means that if you are issuing many concurrent requests against the same container (by directly interacting with it or indirectly, by creating unassigned tasks, for example), you will create contention which will result in slower response times and possibly 412 PreconditionFailedError responses.If you see this, please slow down a bit and try to perform these operations serially.When setting tasks in a container, newly included tasks will be removed from other containers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ANHOAc60wNkraVZS0GMbCaq9MaXzofUPF2PeqRa+lnM="},"614d03ce-322a-472f-9696-91aeb017ba9e":{"id_":"614d03ce-322a-472f-9696-91aeb017ba9e","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/containers"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"af559497-d85b-44cb-9c52-927ddabb2b4d","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/containers"},"hash":"BMM8H1C/nC8mSQOnbXjQ+LnhPspLSDltmxTRxNXDsDU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"58500178-7508-4125-8552-b7a17a7029e3","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/containers"},"hash":"ANHOAc60wNkraVZS0GMbCaq9MaXzofUPF2PeqRa+lnM="}},"text":"Organizations,

container implicitly by omission (for example, setting a container to include tasks A and C when it previously included A, B, and C, thus removing B), this task will be appended to the organization container for the task's executor organization.Likewise, when inserting tasks into a container, newly included tasks will be removed from other containers.You can perform advanced assignment operations by interacting with a container's tasks array property directly.A single endpoint allows for these interactions: PUT /containers/:containerType/:entityId, where containerType is either organizations, teams or workers and entityId is the ID of the entity with the given type against which to perform the assignment operations.Updated about 4 years ago Automatically assign list of

please read through each scenario to determine the best fit for your use case.There are 4 different supported scenarios.(1) Allow All Barcodes\n\nUse-Case: Allows workers (drivers) to provide any number of barcodes or no barcodes.This is the least restrictive method.Implementation: Provide no object members inside the barcodes array\n\n(1) No barcode restrictions\"barcodes\":[]\n\n(2) Restrict to a fixed number of Barcodes \n\nUse-Case: Any barcodes can be scanned and the number of barcodes scanned must match what's configured.This is moderately restrictive.Implementation: Provide object members inside the barcodes array containing no data variables, and enforce the number of barcodes by using \"blockCompletion\":true \n\n📘NoteblockCompletion default value is false, so it may be used to customize this scenario further.For example, require 2 barcodes but allow up to any number of barcodes.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qbs4IOSDSZHkBlbhYb9ofwx+8lbhze0MZGHLCYsswsQ="},"8d0fd1d7-a1d5-4a1e-a2de-e6e533ab7fa1":{"id_":"8d0fd1d7-a1d5-4a1e-a2de-e6e533ab7fa1","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/barcode-scenarios"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"d952132b-78a3-44b9-a0ca-ce2592ffe9ad","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/barcode-scenarios"},"hash":"UWDHWV7jvTrhu6gQ6BErybhknsxpZ4GnaFxzvpRVMR8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1c6d0fef-1df8-40b7-a754-44d85819a4c5","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/barcode-scenarios"},"hash":"qbs4IOSDSZHkBlbhYb9ofwx+8lbhze0MZGHLCYsswsQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"858f4ece-b23a-4129-88b1-2afb6879dba7","metadata":{},"hash":"9k4Cu/UmzcNeprq0b18I7w694Uu0eqehfhBx8H2k4Hc="}},"text":"There

allows you to efficiently generate compliance data for drivers, such as turn-by-turn directions, driving distances, and estimated times of arrival (ETAs).This endpoint retrieves tasks assigned to drivers and works in conjunction with the Google Directions API.The Google API key is optional based on your reporting requirements.There are several requirements in order to use this API endpoint:\n\nOnfleet API Key\nHub ID from Onfleet dashboard as the starting point of the route\nWorker ID with assigned route stops\nA Google Maps Directions API Key (optional)\n\n📘Google Maps Directions APIThis is a service platform provided by Google that Onfleet integrates with to generate a more detailed manifest.To obtain the turnByTurn and totalDistance response, you must include your Google Maps Directions API key, in this specific format Google <google_direction_api_key> in your HTTP header as X-API-KEY.Otherwise, the manifest will only contain the list of tasks assigned to the Driver in sequential order.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"FLgasAYTk8dYaW2Od9jMsv93NC5cETeTAIqpUqfoGr4="},"3b992717-1681-4464-ba77-31500e6811f5":{"id_":"3b992717-1681-4464-ba77-31500e6811f5","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/delivery-manifest"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"da5f77c9-c315-4581-a6df-fb8bba11efa8","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/delivery-manifest"},"hash":"YqaR98U2vS+Gkm7KLcybKFyjzyEc1KUBvg5XNJCB/AU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"da647189-9c88-4404-865e-a497c1fcddf3","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/delivery-manifest"},"hash":"FLgasAYTk8dYaW2Od9jMsv93NC5cETeTAIqpUqfoGr4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"aa905122-8831-46c5-80f9-c95a736ca178","metadata":{},"hash":"obuc7oKaIDyKadldad2sqN5vQdPj9XwimMIEzhDD904="}},"text":"This

Redis, that way you can ensure that you are staying below the limit across all of your apps that issue requests into Onfleet.You should also favor sequential over parallel requests if you don't want to implement a sophisticated rate limiting system.If you exceed 20 req/s, you will first receive a 429 error.Failure to slow down your request rate may result in a temporary ban.The headers

X-RateLimit-Limit and X-RateLimit-Remaining are available to help you understand how many requests are available for a given rolling window period and how many are instantaneously remaining for you to make.Few guidelines on how to avoid making too many requests:\n\nIf possible, use webhooks instead of polling for state changes\nWhen creating many tasks, use the batch endpoint if possible\nIf it seems like you’re making many requests for a simple operation or finding many entities to locally scan for a single one, it’s possible you’re using the API in an inefficient way.Should you require a higher request rate, do let us know by contacting support and we will do everything we can to accommodate your needs.The more details you can share about your existing efforts to stay below the global limit, the better we will be able to understand your situation and provide assistance.Updated about 4 years ago Testing your API keyData Types and Response FormatsUpdated about 4 years ago Testing

boundaries through the Connections feature.Administrator\nAdministrators are users who perform actions via the dashboard.An organization has one administrator of type super and zero or more of type standard (also known as dispatchers in the dashboard).Administrators manage workers based on membership in the organization’s teams.Worker\nWorkers (also known as drivers in the dashboard) are the members of an organization who perform actions via the Onfleet mobile applications.They may belong to teams managed by any number of administrators in their own organization.Workers have a vehicle with which tasks are completed.Hub\nA hub is a depot for a team: the location from where all deliveries start for the team's workers, for the purposes of route optimization only; teams can have zero

PlanGET Route planGET RoutePlan by IDDelete RoutePlanPowered by Webhook AuthenticationWebhook Authentication\nOnfleet uses  HMAC (hash-based message authentication code) with the SHA-512 hash function for additional authentication.The purpose of HMAC is to validate that the message is indeed coming from Onfleet System and not anywhere other sources that are trying to inject different results and ensuring the authenticity of the message.By using the webhook secret obtained on the Onfleet dashboard, your webhook server should verify that the source of webhook requests are indeed coming from Onfleet and is associated with your organization.The difference between this and Webhook Validation is that HMAC is used to authenticate the message payload and the value of the data, while validation is a simple handshake between your service and Onfleet to ensure that the connection is mutually agreed upon.Each webhook request contains a signature from Onfleet in X-Onfleet-Signature header.To authenticate the webhook request received on your webhook server, you will need to validate against this header.To validate against X-Onfleet-Signature, you will need to compare its value with an HMAC you have generated using the hexadecimal format of your webhook secrets and the full body of the webhook POST request in raw bytes.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6N2eZeJH7Vu1NqCrU015imKw+CrzgQg3OadSVSKcuMc="},"c4033297-fc11-48d7-9a0d-f5c80cd655d0":{"id_":"c4033297-fc11-48d7-9a0d-f5c80cd655d0","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/secrets"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"75337baf-d20d-4be8-901d-3036d367c2a5","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/secrets"},"hash":"4BaFoTqK3f8RbIrp9WuFyoOP6ybnSrtTAC0pfROSW9A="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fb8ea2f5-9b2b-452d-a02f-0d0792a9f2f9","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/secrets"},"hash":"6N2eZeJH7Vu1NqCrU015imKw+CrzgQg3OadSVSKcuMc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fe713e6c-933a-4a8d-b0d7-04cb6de075d5","metadata":{},"hash":"48V5MlgUszXt7ArUfJp3CUnQ7OwEDJLzWiKFq+LIDDg="}},"text":"By

information on datatype and formats, please see Data Types and Response Formats or free conversion tool online here.🚧502 Internal Timed outOnfleet has an internal system timeout of 70 seconds, which can be encountered when listing tasks.If the 502 error comes up, try narrowing your search parameters so that query can be executed more quickly.🚧ParametersWhen a search parameter key contains more than one value, the acceptable method is to supply those parameters with comma delimiters.For example:Valid Input: /api/v2/tasks/all?from=1455072025000&state=1,2,3Invalid input: /api/v2/tasks/all?from=1455072025000&state=1&state=2&state=3\nTo walk through the pagination of all tasks from the from timestamp, append another query parameter of

tasks in batch - async.For any legacy development, please consider migrating to the batch async endpoint as soon as possible to prevent any service interruptions.Create tasks in batch\nYou may create multiple tasks in a single request by using this batch endpoint.This is particularly helpful if you want to create unassigned tasks quickly for future assignment or optimization, without having to worry about orchestrating requests to avoid excessive contention around the organization container lock.Automatic assignment is not currently supported by this endpoint.You will also not receive taskCreated webhook requests for batch task creations if you have registered for this trigger.Processing will take place for all the tasks provided and you will receive a response with tasks containing the full details of the successfully created tasks and errors with any issues that may have been found.These errors contain both the error as well as the body provided for the problematic task so your integration can more easily react to the problem.Make sure that you increase your timeout value for this request as it could take considerably longer than others.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"O06zpCmJp0eeqZc50mfrjs4RPA4SC4Q72Dn66n93IbI="},"a9e97795-0366-4789-8d1d-963bcfb5e528":{"id_":"a9e97795-0366-4789-8d1d-963bcfb5e528","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/create-tasks-in-batch"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"7b5d1928-1815-451a-b929-994103fe1f0c","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/create-tasks-in-batch"},"hash":"wtlawo1hVtN7gOgk8UXbiRcfRsCOLIS9dAIkuWsXQlI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3c406dd0-1de8-4a42-948f-79e39678568d","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/create-tasks-in-batch"},"hash":"O06zpCmJp0eeqZc50mfrjs4RPA4SC4Q72Dn66n93IbI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c96ad917-ff43-445d-aa10-385f3ad9b850","metadata":{},"hash":"lHADaySRw3/h7ITv11sv2xj9Z7Xejl3tunT5K+l1CBk="}},"text":"For

definition of the task object.🚧Internal TimeoutOnfleet has an internal system timeout of 70 seconds, in which Batch creation may encounter when uploading more than 25* tasks at a time.When this happens, the tasks are still being processed and will be created, but will not be able to respond to the HTTP request with relevant data.If this error is encountered, try to lower the number of tasks

control the target server.Note that validation happens right at webhook creation, meaning that we will issue a request to you before successfully registering the webhook.The validation will send a GET request to your url with a query string of check=<random_string>, your webhook server should respond back with the <random_string> to be validated.For example:\nExample URLhttps://yourwebsite.com/webhooks/?check=example\n\nphpjavascriptpython$reply_value = $_GET['check']; // Outputs example and then send it back\napp.get(\"/webhooks\", (req, res) => {\n

that validation happens right at webhook creation, meaning that we will issue a request to you before successfully registering the webhook.The validation will send a GET request to your url with a query string of check=<random_string>, your webhook server should respond back with the <random_string> to be validated.For example:\nExample URLhttps://yourwebsite.com/webhooks/?check=example\n\nphpjavascriptpython$reply_value = $_GET['check']; // Outputs example and then send it back\napp.get(\"/webhooks\", (req, res) => {\n

HTTP 200 (HTTP 204 is not accepted, even though that is considered a successful response) along side with the string example.The string will change with each webhook trigger, so it's necessary to have the same string that was returned to our server for validation.❗️Timed out TimerThe recommended pattern for processing our webhooks is to first respond to our request with an HTTP 200 response and then process the data afterwards, as the request will time out in 10 seconds without a response.Any timed out requests will be be retried in 30 second intervals.After 300 consecutive failed requests the webhook will be disabled.📘Automatic validationIf you use Zapier webhooks instead of your own backend's, validation will be automatic.📘ServerlessIn the case that you do not have a server of your own, i.e. using another 3rd party platform, we recommend using services such as AWS Lambda functions.They can return the validation requirements back to our server, and redirect the payload further

to Onfleet’s API!This guide walks you through the basic topics you should consider when integrating with Onfleet.What programming language are you using for your integration?If the answer is Python, PHP, Java, JavaScript, Ruby or Go you are more than welcome to jumpstart your integration by using our pre-built official API Wrappers: pyonfleet, php-onfleet, node-onfleet, java-onfleet, ruby-onfleet and gonfleet.Other users have created their own scripts and features to make Onfleet work for them, and we love to see it!If you don’t see the language of your preference here, there may be an unofficial wrappers available through other users' repositories on github.However, we can only support issues with content in the official onfleet github.Do you have an Onfleet API key?If the answer is no, please log on to the Onfleet dashboard with your organization admin email and create an API key.📘Testing your API keyOnce you have an API key created, you can test it by hitting our authorization endpoint.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Gq18UrFTt99cBuv27A63GXVpPXvTnl5WhVTZuEWdgvA="},"375e0160-d7b2-4794-9828-830ddb465a66":{"id_":"375e0160-d7b2-4794-9828-830ddb465a66","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"1da0e07e-5ee7-432f-b0b6-318bb8643bf7","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference"},"hash":"bsfhK6rw9tsMhKp+wwH/qgyIKxtlp+3V3Dn9uxTv/44="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"eca35cb0-39e3-4a6e-bb13-7652bfcefd08","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference"},"hash":"Gq18UrFTt99cBuv27A63GXVpPXvTnl5WhVTZuEWdgvA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0340d81d-b139-423e-97ef-613fa5361a4f","metadata":{},"hash":"RYiFV6XyKaD8fBqKilaFpLHmU6Aa/yNrcOzygo3hmAw="}},"text":"What

API keyOnce you have an API key created, you can test it by hitting our authorization endpoint.Using the API key?To interact with the Onfleet API, you will need to issue an HTTP request and each request will need to be authenticated using the Onfleet API key.Our examples in the documentation are shown in cURL command form, where the commands are executed via a terminal.This is an example of an HTTP request in the form of a cURL command, which includes a <METHOD> and you will need to input your preferred <api_endpoint>, <api_key>, and <body> (optional):\nShellcurl -X <METHOD> \"https://onfleet.com/api/v2/<api_endpoint>\" -u \"<your_api_key>:\" -d \"<body>\"\n\nIf you are not familiar with cURL commands, we recommend using the following tools to send test API requests to Onfleet:\n\nPostman\nInsomnia\n\nWhat is your delivery business model?Everything at Onfleet starts with a task, a task is a single unit of work performed at a destination, and is either a pickup or a dropoff.If you perform deliveries that originate at one pickup location, an order in your e-commerce system can be represented by a single dropoff task in Onfleet.This approach is common for scheduled delivery models like produce, grocery, etc...If you perform unique pickups for each order, then you will need to create two linked tasks in Onfleet to represent the pickup and then the subsequent dropoff.This approach is common for scheduled and on-demand models like laundry and dry cleaning, restaurant, etc...🚧Linked Pickup & DropoffFor businesses creating a pickup/dropoff combo, learn more in linked tasks and task dependencies.How do I create a task?\n\n\nA Task should always have one Destination, which can be created using an address or a set of GPS coordinates. Creating a Destination can be done separately or during task creation. \n\n\nThe Recipient field can be used if someone needs to be informed that the task has started or completed. Recipients receive SMS text notifications and can track driver statuses when properly configured in the dashboard. The recipient field can be left empty. Like Destination, it can be created separately or during task creation. \n\n\nA Task is created and managed by a registered Administrator (either on the dashboard or via the API), and can only be started and completed by a registered Worker (via the Onfleet mobile app).You can decide whether to use more advanced features duringtask creation, including:\n\nTask assignment: automatically or manually\nCreating proof-of-delivery/completion requirements\n\nDo you need any information sent back to your applications?Information can be sent back to your application (ie: order management, e-commerce, customer-facing mobile apps) by utilizing Onfleet Webhooks, where we offer more than 10 event triggers.Do you need custom information stored in Onfleet?If you would like to interact with Onfleet’s API using external identifiers (ie: order numbers, driver’s licenses etc.), or display custom structured data to Onfleet dashboard and mobile app users, you can store custom information on many of Onfleet’s objects using the metadata fields.Learn more about creating and storing custom data using Metadata.How will you validate address information prior to creating tasks in Onfleet?It is critical that your team has accurate address information to successfully perform pickups and deliveries.Onfleet requires a valid destination address or coordinate pair (longitude, latitude) in order to create a task.🚧We highly recommend validating the address information prior to sending it to Onfleet and using a coordinate pair at task creation, ensuring tasks will always be created.When only an address is provided, Onfleet uses Google Maps Javascript API to geocode the address information provided.In cases where your task destination creation fails geocoding, you can follow this troubleshooting guide to find a viable solution.Here's a developer tool showing how the Maps API responds to an address, note that Onfleet will reject anything that is deemed inaccurate (a generic geographic region or multiple matching results):\nGoogle Developers\nHow will you validate phone numbers prior to creating

recipients.In cases where you've encountered a failed request regarding an invalid phone number, it is recommended to set up a failover to capture the failed request and respond properly.Here's a community tool that utilizes the same phone validation library, simply put in a phone number that you wish to test and click submit.The results shown under Validation Results will tell you whether the number is valid or not:\nnull\nWhat proof-of-delivery options do you expect to use?Onfleet offers the following as proof-of-delivery options:\n\nSignature\nPhoto(s)\nBarcode scanning (Premium or above plans)\nID verification (Premium or above plans)\n\nAll of these can be set on the task level depending on your subscribed Onfleet plan, learn more about them in Completion Requirements.👍Ready to

flexibility, and can be used for everything from attaching purchase order numbers to tasks and maintaining inventory counts, to keeping track of additional driver attributes and much more.As an initial example, say you want to keep track of your workers by the neighborhood in which they start their shifts.Instead of introducing complexity by creating teams for each of your city’s neighborhoods and managing those memberships for each worker (or using hubs), you can simply create or update a worker and include a neighborhood metadata property.Here’s a worker for whom the neighborhood metadata property has been set:\nJSON{\n    \"id\": \"2Fwp6wS5wLNjDn36r1LJPscA\",\n    \"name\": \"Marco Emery\",\n    \"teams\": [\n        \"0pgyktD5f3RpV3gfGZn9HPIt\"\n    ],\n\t\t//

organization’s workers and group them in your application logic based on the value of the neighborhood metadata properties in the response.metadata is always a top-level array property on the entity where each member of the array represents a single metadata entry.The order of the metadata entries does not matter as the array is simply a set containing zero or more entries.At the moment, permissions for entity metadata are such that these can only be accessed via API.Whether you are implementing custom, on-demand inventory workflows or simply want a quick way to retrieve entities that share a certain custom property, metadata makes it easy to take existing API functionality and adapt it to the specific needs of your application.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"USy9/IJYBKTx1clXE5gKKu84zFmo0LI0BHAwqRIbr+w="},"1b52feaf-d302-4919-85fc-bc40b8dad95f":{"id_":"1b52feaf-d302-4919-85fc-bc40b8dad95f","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/metadata"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"af61d2c6-39e3-4b62-bc4c-35a0fbaf2d92","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/metadata"},"hash":"y1q0Mmuqt8bqTeT80nm9ig1f+6hJas1OMyhQgNkPVZw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b0fffef3-1409-46f7-9dcd-c48887c0e9ae","metadata":{"url":"https://docs.onfleet.com/reference/metadata"},"hash":"RgS7gxsLpC986coNM7E4Huuz2zPcmq2gxCtizTQ/y0g="}},"text":"You

PHP, Java, JavaScript, Ruby or Go you are more than welcome to jumpstart your integration by using our pre-built official API Wrappers: pyonfleet, php-onfleet, node-onfleet, java-onfleet, ruby-onfleet and gonfleet.Other users have created their own scripts and features to make Onfleet work for them, and we love to see it!If you don’t see the language of your preference here, there may be an unofficial wrappers available through other users' repositories on github.However, we can only support issues with content in the official onfleet github.Do you have an Onfleet API key?If the answer is no, please log on to the Onfleet dashboard with your organization admin email and create an API key.📘Testing your API keyOnce you have an API key created, you can test it by hitting our authorization endpoint.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jqcOWubsDS+xVUzaMitWZv2GHR6cK0QE3dDFa2QJ7ho="},"27a2a6d1-2da5-4e87-8d62-46c5b5ccc830":{"id_":"27a2a6d1-2da5-4e87-8d62-46c5b5ccc830","metadata":{"url":"http://docs.onfleet.com/reference"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bfe22c41-0543-4d6e-ab2a-93029304aeec","metadata":{"url":"http://docs.onfleet.com/reference"},"hash":"SNCZXB7xbcoT/C9GjyqCjazk/I7/GcbQ24T5Rx87QoQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"993300bb-d695-4e0f-b827-46cef0f05244","metadata":{"url":"http://docs.onfleet.com/reference"},"hash":"jqcOWubsDS+xVUzaMitWZv2GHR6cK0QE3dDFa2QJ7ho="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f069b83e-d4b7-48dd-9bfa-46c30b89c896","metadata":{},"hash":"RYiFV6XyKaD8fBqKilaFpLHmU6Aa/yNrcOzygo3hmAw="}},"text":"What

API keyOnce you have an API key created, you can test it by hitting our authorization endpoint.Using the API key?To interact with the Onfleet API, you will need to issue an HTTP request and each request will need to be authenticated using the Onfleet API key.Our examples in the documentation are shown in cURL command form, where the commands are executed via a terminal.This is an example of an HTTP request in the form of a cURL command, which includes a <METHOD> and you will need to input your preferred <api_endpoint>, <api_key>, and <body> (optional):\nShellcurl -X <METHOD> \"https://onfleet.com/api/v2/<api_endpoint>\" -u \"<your_api_key>:\" -d \"<body>\"\n\nIf you are not familiar with cURL commands, we recommend using the following tools to send test API requests to Onfleet:\n\nPostman\nInsomnia\n\nWhat is your delivery business model?Everything at Onfleet starts with a task, a task is a single unit of work performed at a destination, and is either a pickup or a dropoff.If you perform deliveries that originate at one pickup location, an order in your e-commerce system can be represented by a single dropoff task in Onfleet.This approach is common for scheduled delivery models like produce, grocery, etc...If you perform unique pickups for each order, then you will need to create two linked tasks in Onfleet to represent the pickup and then the subsequent dropoff.This approach is common for scheduled and on-demand models like laundry and dry cleaning, restaurant, etc...🚧Linked Pickup & DropoffFor businesses creating a pickup/dropoff combo, learn more in linked tasks and task dependencies.How do I create a task?\n\n\nA Task should always have one Destination, which can be created using an address or a set of GPS coordinates. Creating a Destination can be done separately or during task creation. \n\n\nThe Recipient field can be used if someone needs to be informed that the task has started or completed. Recipients receive SMS text notifications and can track driver statuses when properly configured in the dashboard. The recipient field can be left empty. Like Destination, it can be created separately or during task creation. \n\n\nA Task is created and managed by a registered Administrator (either on the dashboard or via the API), and can only be started and completed by a registered Worker (via the Onfleet mobile app).You can decide whether to use more advanced features duringtask creation, including:\n\nTask assignment: automatically or manually\nCreating proof-of-delivery/completion requirements\n\nDo you need any information sent back to your applications?Information can be sent back to your application (ie: order management, e-commerce, customer-facing mobile apps) by utilizing Onfleet Webhooks, where we offer more than 10 event triggers.Do you need custom information stored in Onfleet?If you would like to interact with Onfleet’s API using external identifiers (ie: order numbers, driver’s licenses etc.), or display custom structured data to Onfleet dashboard and mobile app users, you can store custom information on many of Onfleet’s objects using the metadata fields.Learn more about creating and storing custom data using Metadata.How will you validate address information prior to creating tasks in Onfleet?It is critical that your team has accurate address information to successfully perform pickups and deliveries.Onfleet requires a valid destination address or coordinate pair (longitude, latitude) in order to create a task.🚧We highly recommend validating the address information prior to sending it to Onfleet and using a coordinate pair at task creation, ensuring tasks will always be created.When only an address is provided, Onfleet uses Google Maps Javascript API to geocode the address information provided.In cases where your task destination creation fails geocoding, you can follow this troubleshooting guide to find a viable solution.Here's a developer tool showing how the Maps API responds to an address, note that Onfleet will reject anything that is deemed inaccurate (a generic geographic region or multiple matching results):\nGoogle Developers\nHow will you validate phone numbers prior to creating

recipients.In cases where you've encountered a failed request regarding an invalid phone number, it is recommended to set up a failover to capture the failed request and respond properly.Here's a community tool that utilizes the same phone validation library, simply put in a phone number that you wish to test and click submit.The results shown under Validation Results will tell you whether the number is valid or not:\nnull\nWhat proof-of-delivery options do you expect to use?Onfleet offers the following as proof-of-delivery options:\n\nSignature\nPhoto(s)\nBarcode scanning (Premium or above
