There are a few endpoints that only exist on the V1 REST API awaiting migration to the new API. You can find the API Reference here.\\nREST API V2 and GraphQL API​\\nOur latest APIs which are accessible via REST or GraphQL. We are actively working on adding support for all endpoints within REST API V1. You can find the API reference for the REST API V2 here. and the API reference for the GraphQL API here.\\nAuthentication​\\nAuthorization Headers​\\nAuthorization - A valid JWT associated with your username or api account.\\napikey - A valid api key. This header should be present on every request.\\nThe API works through a mixture of JWT and Key auth.\\nIf no Authorization header is included, the API will assume that you are making a request with an anonymous user.\\nIf an Authorization header is included, the API will \\\"switch\\\" to the role of the user or api account making the request.\\n\\nANON_KEY - The public API key shared by all users. Required by all API calls.\\nYOUR_KEY - The JSON Web Token (JWT) associated with your username or api account. Required to call any APIs specific to a business.\\n\\nExample request:\\ncurl 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/webhook_actions' \\\\-H \\\"apikey: ANON_KEY\\\" \\\\-H \\\"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY\\\"\\nCreating an API Account​\\nYou can create an API account to access your businesses resources across ChannelApe API's. To do this, you need be the owner of the business. Run the following command:\\ncurl 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/rpc/create_api_account' \\\\-d '{ \\\"business_id\\\": \\\"c8c6bcfa-f544-4680-bbf3-7d93aee95efa\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"My API Account\\\" }' \\\\-H \\\"apikey: ANON_KEY\\\" \\\\-H \\\"Content-Type: application/vnd.pgrst.object+json\\\" \\\\-H \\\"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY\\\"\\nThis will create your API account private key. Note, that this is only shown once, so ensure you save it.\\nOnce you have your API secret you can 'login' with your API account. This essentially generates a short-lived (4 hour) JWT that can be used like any other JWT in the system.\\nExample login request:\\ncurl -X POST 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/rpc/login_api_account' \\\\-d '{ \\\"account_id\\\": \\\"value\\\", \\\"secret\\\": \\\"value\\\" }' \\\\-H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\-H \\\"apikey: ANON_KEY\\\" \\\\\\nJSON Web Tokens (JWTs)​\\nJWTs expire after a certain amount of time and need to be refreshed before they expire. If you need require long term API Access and are unable to refresh your JWT regularly please email support@channelape.com.\\nRate Limiting​\\nAPI users are restricted to a rate limit. ChannelApe businesses have a default limit of 5 requests per second across all of the API Accounts of a business. When a request is rate limited, a 429 level status code will be returned. If you need an increased rate limit, please email support@channelape.com.PreviousIntroductionNextBusinessesAvailable APIsREST API V1REST API V2 and GraphQL APIAuthenticationAuthorization HeadersCreating an API AccountJSON Web Tokens (JWTs)Rate LimitingCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"s4rxV5p8UZibG7XfFGANJB/tjWwTrwOyiLkruyjzvZI=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"4641a965-0fc0-4416-bc2c-a8160df9e26c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4641a965-0fc0-4416-bc2c-a8160df9e26c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/pos-and-stos\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"POs and STOs | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteIntroductionAPI UsageBusinessesChannelsSuppliersLocationsActionsOrder ActivitiesPlaybookInventoryOrdersShipmentsOverviewPOs and STOsSales OrdersShipment StatusShipment Inventory AdjustmentsShipment CreationShipment WebhooksShipment Receipt CreationShipment Receipt WebhooksShipment AllocationsUpsertsWebhooksShipmentsPOs and STOsOn this pagePOs and STOsA stock transfer order is a request to transfer inventory between locations, while a purchase order is a request to purchase goods or services from a supplier.

This documentation\\npage provides an overview of how our implementation of upsert works.\\nDetails for each upsert operation can be found in the API Reference.\\nSearching​\\nThe general structure of a models typically consist of the following fields:\\n\\nid: a unique identifier for the model within the ChannelApe platform.\\nexternal_ids: a key-value map of external identifiers for the model, such as\\n{\\\"WAREHOUSE_DALLAS_ID\\\": \\\"12345\\\", \\\"SHIPPING_COMPANY_ID\\\": \\\"54321\\\"}.\\nbusiness_id: the unique identifier for the business that owns the model.\\n\\nWhen you send a model to us, we first attempt to find an existing model that\\nmatches the one you provided. The found match must be unique to be considered\\nusable.\\nThe matching conditions are evaluated in the following order:\\n\\nid\\nexternal_ids\\nNatural keys\\n\\nID​\\nIf you include the id field, we will search for a model with that specific\\nidentifier. Supplying the id indicates that you already know the model you are\\nlooking for. If it doesn't exist, we will create a new model with the supplied\\nid value.\\n\\nNote ids are GUIDs (globally unique identifiers) and are in the form\\nxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. Use a library for your platform to\\ngenerate these values if you must know the id before creating the model.\\nIt's generally not recommended to use this method.\\n\\nBecause id is a globally unique identifier no other search conditions are\\nevaluated if. The rest of the criteria below \\\"fall through\\\" if they don't match.\\nExternal IDs​\\nExternal IDs are a key-value map of external identifiers for the model. You only\\nneed to provide a subset of the external IDs. For example, if your model has the\\nfollowing external_ids:\\n{  \\\"KEY_1\\\": \\\"value_1\\\",  \\\"KEY_2\\\": \\\"value_2\\\"}\\nYou can submit the following input:\\n{  \\\"external_ids\\\": {    \\\"KEY_1\\\": \\\"value_1\\\"  }}\\nThe model will match on KEY_1 as the values are equal. However, including\\nmultiple keys might cause the model to not be found, for example:\\n{  \\\"external_ids\\\": {    \\\"KEY_1\\\": \\\"value_1\\\",    \\\"KEY_2\\\": \\\"new_value\\\"  }}\\nWould not match as both KEY_1 and KEY_2 must match the values provided.\\n\\nAt the time of writing, external IDs are not supported for all models. Also no\\nguarantee is made that external IDs are unique. The key of external id's is\\nsupposed to be the context in which it's used. For example if during inventory\\nprocessing you need to reference an identifier from your warehouse management\\nsystem, you could use\\n{\\\"INVENTORY_PROCESSING_ID\\\": \\\"[ID_FROM_WAREHOUSE_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM]\\\"}. This\\ncan only work as well as the id you provide is unique in the context. If the\\nunderlying system returns the same id for multiple items, upsert will likely\\nfail to find a unique match.\\n\\nNatural Keys​\\nNatural keys are a set of fields that uniquely identify a model based on their\\ninherent characteristics. For example, in the context of inventory items, the\\nsku or in the context of locations, the name could be considered natural\\nkeys. Although these values are not truly unique in most cases, they are\\ntypically unique within a specific context.\\nContext Values​\\nAny key that identifies a parent resource, also known as a foreign key, is used\\nto narrow down the search domain. For instance, the business_id represents the\\nID of the business that owns the model. Suppose your account has access to a\\nsingle business, and you send the following request:\\n{  \\\"inventory_item\\\": {    \\\"sku\\\": \\\"sku-123\\\",    \\\"title\\\": \\\"New Title\\\"  }}\\nIn this case, the same inventory item will always be found because the sku is\\nunique per business. However, if your account gains access to another business\\nand sends the same request, there is a chance that the inventory item will be\\nfound in the other business. This is because the sku is not globally unique,\\nbut unique within each business. To resolve this, include the business_id\\nfield:\\n{  \\\"inventory_item\\\": {    \\\"business_id\\\": \\\"[target_business_id]\\\",    \\\"sku\\\": \\\"sku-123\\\",    \\\"title\\\": \\\"New Title\\\"  }}\\nTo identify what values constitute a context value look at the post request in\\nthe documentation for the model you are trying to upsert. For example, the\\ninventory item has a\\nNote: This is a Foreign Key to businesses.id. next to business_id.\\n\\nIn more complex models, upsert is called from the top down calling other\\nmodels upsert functions. Setting context values at the top level will\\npropagate to the nested models. For example, setting business_id in the top\\nlevel of upsert_shipments_full will automatically set the business_id for\\naddresses, locations, shipment items, and so on, when performing their\\nrespective upsert operations. It's not suggested to set context values in\\nnested models unless you specifically want to move a model from one business\\nto another.\\n\\nInserting​\\nIf no model is found, we will create a new one. The model will be created with\\nthe values provided in the request body. All fields marked as required must be\\nprovided, except for id.\\nUpdating​\\nIf a unique model is found, we will update it with the values provided in the\\nrequest body. In the update scenario all fields are optional except for\\nidentifier information discussed in search.\\nBy default the model will be patched. This means that only the fields you\\nprovide will be updated. If you want to replace the entire model, you can set\\nthe patch field to false. This will replace the entire model with the one you\\nsend us. Do note that this will remove any fields you don't send us.\\n\\nThe exception to this rule is any required fields will be copied over from the\\nexisting model.\\n\\nExternal Ids​\\nRegardless of that patch value, external IDs will always be patched and merged\\nwith the existing external IDs. On key collision, the value in the request will\\noverwrite the existing value.\\nIf you really want to replace the entire external IDs map, use the patch method\\nprovided by the rest api directly or mutate via the graphql api.\\nResult​\\nRegardless of whether a model was inserted or updated, the response will always\\nbe the entire model as it's stored in the system. The result is identical to\\ncalling the post method on the rest api directly.\\nBest Practices​\\nIf you have the id of an existing model, use it. This requires no further\\ncontext and is the most efficient way to upsert a model.\\nIf you don't, use the external_ids field and provide as many context\\nidentifiers as possible. At the very minimum business_id should be provided as\\nwell.\\nIn some cases natural keys are better than external IDs. By there very nature\\nthis should be apparent although efforts in documenting this by function are\\nongoing.\\nAdditional Notes​\\nSafety​\\nUpsert is a non destructive operation, tt will never delete a model. This may\\nchange in the future but it'll be opt-in with a delete flag.\\nUpsert is also acid compliant, if the\\nrequest fails, no changes will be made to the system regardless of the\\ncomplexity of the model.\\nPermissions​\\nUpsert has no knowledge of the current permissions of the user executing it. It\\nalso doesn't have elevated permissions. This means that it can only select,\\ncreate and update models that the executing user has access to. It'll also\\nblindly attempt to do these operations on your behalf failing the operation if\\nyou don't have the required permissions.\\nSummary​\\nAlways keep in mind that upsert is a best effort operation. If you provide\\nsufficient information to uniquely identify a model the operation will\\ngenerally behave as expected.PreviousOverviewNextWebhooksSearchingIDExternal IDsNatural KeysContext ValuesInsertingUpdatingExternal IdsResultBest PracticesAdditional NotesSafetyPermissionsSummaryCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"cMhnqiPjarloHKgpoYMz6YIJag05d1vj37ThiTAjVh0=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"954b4cc3-e69e-437a-9fe9-52a294d369c8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"954b4cc3-e69e-437a-9fe9-52a294d369c8\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/actions\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Actions | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteIntroductionAPI UsageBusinessesChannelsSuppliersLocationsActionsOrder ActivitiesPlaybookInventoryOrdersShipmentsUpsertsWebhooksActionsActionsBatches of work being done against a channel or supplier.\\nChannel actions are used to orders or sync inventory from ChannelApe to a channel.\\nSupplier actions are used to send order fulfillment requests to a warehouse or sync inventory into ChannelApe.\\nActions can be run manually or run as part of a schedule.

This means that if you send us a model and\\nwe can identify a unique instance of it we will update it, otherwise we will\\ncreate a new one.\\n\\nNote: Upsert trades control for convenience. It's really intended for\\nlow-code/no-code integrations. It works on best effort basis and will attempt\\nto do the right thing where possible. If you need more control, use the\\naforementioned rest or graphql endpoints. But it is a great way to get started\\nquickly.\\n\\nGeneral Upsert Structure​\\nThe upsert structure is generally the same for all models. It is a simple JSON\\nobject with two fields:\\n\\npatch: an optional boolean indicating whether or not to patch the model\\n(defaults to true) see more\\n[entity_name]: partial model you want to upsert, this differs per model\\n\\nThe url for the upsert endpoint will be the same as the rest endpoint but with\\n/rpc/upsert_[entity_name] appended to it. You can find all the upsert\\nendpoints in the API Reference.\\nWe'll go over each of these in detail later but for now let's look at an\\nexample. Here is an example request against the inventory item upsert endpoint:\\nPOST https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/rpc/upsert_inventory_item  HTTP/1.1Content-Type: application/jsonapikey: ANON_KEYAuthorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY{    \\\"inventory_item\\\": {    \\\"business_id\\\": \\\"[your_business_id]\\\",    \\\"sku\\\": \\\"sku_123\\\",    \\\"title\\\": \\\"New Title\\\",  }}\\nHere is what the result will be:\\n{  \\\"id\\\": \\\"[unique_id]\\\",  \\\"sku\\\": \\\"sku_123\\\",  \\\"title\\\": \\\"New Title\\\",  \\\"business_id\\\": \\\"[your_business_id]\\\",  \\\"legacy_id\\\": null}\\nYou may call this endpoint as many times as you like and it will always return\\nthe same result.

Operations determine which action is take upon the quantity you give the API.\\n\\n\\nSet - Resets the quantity to the given quantity passed to the API. This is good for when you want to true-up on values you know are accurate at either the warehouse or channel. It's recommended you do this once a day if possible with your inventory levels prior to business hours so that your channels have accurate inventory levels.\\n\\n\\nAdjust - This will perform a relative adjustment on the current inventory levels for the item. This operation is useful when you do not want to perform a reset and have activity during the day such as orders being placed and fulfilled.

This allows for logical grouping of orders, channels, inventory, and suppliers within the platform. Additionally, some customers may choose to segregate their businesses based on geographic location, such as North America versus Europe.

This article outlines what configuration and fields are important to get the most out of the ChannelApe ecosystem.\\nChannel Setup​\\nInstall your favorite channel and pull in orders or create a webhook channel to place created orders. Orders can not exist outside of a channel currently.\\nIf you want to enable automated inventory adjustments(see below) when orders occur ensure you have a location set on the channel. Location is an optional field on the channel but it should look something like below.\\n/v1/orders POST\\n{    \\\"additionalFields\\\": [],    \\\"businessId\\\": \\\"0ba2563e-92fa-41e8-98e1-97361c3e608a\\\",    \\\"createdAt\\\": \\\"2021-07-01T09:31:24.698Z\\\",    \\\"enabled\\\": true,    \\\"integrationId\\\": \\\"a586f946-1209-4822-a145-d9cadc94495e\\\",    \\\"locationId\\\": \\\"123\\\",    \\\"name\\\": \\\"My Cool Webhook Channel\\\",    \\\"settings\\\": {        \\\"allowCreate\\\": true,        \\\"allowDelete\\\": false,        \\\"allowRead\\\": true,        \\\"allowUpdate\\\": true,        \\\"disableVariants\\\": false,        \\\"outputFile\\\": {            \\\"header\\\": true,            \\\"columns\\\": []        },        \\\"priceType\\\": \\\"retail\\\",        \\\"updateFields\\\": []    },    \\\"updatedAt\\\": \\\"2021-07-01T09:35:59.107Z\\\"}\\nOrder statuses and their meaning​\\n\\nOPEN - The order has been placed but there is still a chance to make changes. Usually used in playbook with our Customer Service Window functionality that allows CX agents to be able to make a change to an order before the order is sent to the warehouse.\\nHOLD - Their is something wrong with the order and it has been placed in this status for a CX team member to review. Possibly issues would be around shipping address being invalid.\\nIN_PROGRESS - The order has been fully or partially sent to the warehouse to be fulfilled. It's ideal that no changes come into the order at this point unless the warehouse supports it, but this is rare.\\nCLOSED - The order has been fulfilled completely or the order has been closed on the channel. Once in this status, there is nothing else to do with the order, and these are filtered out of most of ChannelApe processing.\\nCANCELED - The order has been canceled by either the customer or the warehouse.\\n\\nCreating an Order​\\nTo get an order into the order management system you need to create it in ChannelApe. There are a few fields to note when creating an order.\\nOrder level fields​\\n\\nchannelOrderId - The external identifier for the order. This needs to be unique per business.\\npurchaseOrderNumber - The purchase order number for the order. This is optional and can be shared across orders but generally should be unique as well.\\nchannel - The channel you created above\\nstatus - The current status of the order. Ideally should be placed in OPEN and let the ChannelApe order management system take it the rest of the way.\\npurchasedAt - The time the order was placed.\\nalphabeticCurrencyCode - The three letter ISO 4217 currency code. (USD, CAD)\\n\\nCustomer​\\nInformation about the customer. The main thing ChannelApe uses here are the shipping and billing address. But these fields can also further identify the customer for the order.\\n\\nemail\\nphone\\nname\\n\\nCustomer Address (Shipping and Billing Address)​\\n\\naddress1\\naddress2\\ncity\\nprovince\\nprovinceCode\\ncountry\\ncountryCode\\npostalCode\\n\\nLine Items​\\nEach order placed needs at least one item.\\n\\nid - a unique identifier, that is required. This is how ChannelApe will try to identify line items.\\nsku - A string that represents a product. If you want automated inventory adjustments, then this should match inventory item sku in the ChannelApe Inventory Management system. It will keep track of quantities of all skus on the order that the system knows about and ignore the rest.\\nquantity - The quantity being ordered. Note: that once created you can only increase this number. ChannelApe API will prevent you from reducing this number.\\nprice - the cost * quantity ordered.\\n\\nFinally, the order should look something like this when creating it.\\n{    \\\"alphabeticCurrencyCode\\\": \\\"USD\\\",    \\\"channelId\\\": \\\"42b714f4-9372-46db-8892-605a53fd4ae4\\\",    \\\"channelOrderId\\\": \\\"demotest-id-1\\\",    \\\"customer\\\": {        \\\"billingAddress\\\": {            \\\"address1\\\": \\\"224 Wyoming Ave\\\",            \\\"address2\\\": \\\"Suite 100\\\",            \\\"city\\\": \\\"Scranton\\\",            \\\"province\\\": \\\"Pennsylvania\\\",            \\\"country\\\": \\\"United States\\\",            \\\"postalCode\\\": \\\"18503\\\"        },        \\\"email\\\": \\\"jdoe@example.com\\\",        \\\"firstName\\\": \\\"John\\\",        \\\"lastName\\\": \\\"Doe\\\",        \\\"shippingAddress\\\": {            \\\"address1\\\": \\\"224 Wyoming Ave\\\",            \\\"address2\\\": \\\"Suite 100\\\",            \\\"city\\\": \\\"Scranton\\\",            \\\"province\\\": \\\"Pennsylvania\\\",            \\\"country\\\": \\\"United States\\\",            \\\"postalCode\\\": \\\"18503\\\"        }    },    \\\"lineItems\\\": [        {            \\\"id\\\": \\\"123\\\",            \\\"quantity\\\": 2,            \\\"sku\\\": \\\"ABC-123\\\",            \\\"price\\\": \\\"99.99\\\"        }    ],    \\\"purchaseOrderNumber\\\": \\\"po-1\\\",    \\\"purchasedAt\\\": \\\"2023-11-14T16:02:05.000Z\\\",    \\\"status\\\": \\\"IN_PROGRESS\\\"}\\nFulfilling an Order​\\nFulfillments on an order are the way to identify when an item on the order is shipped.\\nIf you are responsible for creating fulfilllments on a ChannelApe order, there a few important things to keep in mind.\\nFulfillment Statuses and their meanings​\\n\\nPENDING - The fulfillment that is usually created when it is sent to the warehouse.\\nOPEN - The fulfillment was received back from the warehouse and has enough information to pass back to the channel. If you are not using external systems to communicate the fulfillment, you most likely do not need this status.\\nSUCCESS - The fulfillment has all of the tracking information and no more information is needed.\\n\\nFulfillment level fields​\\n\\nid - All fulfillments need an ID. This field is technically not required currently but going forward it will be generated for you if you do not pass one in.\\nlineItems - See above\\ntrackingNumber - The tracking number for the shipment\\nshippingMethod - The method for which the box is shipping.\\nshippingCompany - the company that will be handling the shipping.\\n\\nYou can use /v1/orders PATCH\\n{    \\\"fulfillments\\\": [        {            \\\"id\\\": \\\"456\\\",            \\\"lineItems\\\": [                {                    \\\"id\\\": \\\"123\\\",                    \\\"price\\\": \\\"99.99\\\",                    \\\"quantity\\\": 1,                    \\\"sku\\\": \\\"ABC-123\\\"                }            ],            \\\"shippedAt\\\": \\\"2023-11-16T15:54:03.239Z\\\",            \\\"status\\\": \\\"SUCCESS\\\",            \\\"trackingUrls\\\": []        }    ]}\\nAutomated inventory adjustments​\\nIf you follow the above the following inventory adjustments should automatically happen.

Webhooks are a performant alternative to continuously polling for changes.\\nFor example, a webhook can notify your app when a user updates a shipment. Your app can then perform an action when the shipment change occurs.\\nThis guide introduces how webhooks work, including how to configure a webhook for your app and manage webhooks.\\nWebhook Concepts​\\nTo help orient you with the content in this guide, the following definitions explain webhook concepts:\\nWebhook Configuration: Links a webhook endpoint (hook consumer url) to a business.\\nWebhook: A single event message. ChannelApe sends a webhook to an webhook configuration's hook consumer url. A webhook contains a JSON payload in the body, and metadata in the headers.\\nWebhook Action: A class of webhook events. An action controls when webhook events are created and what's in the webhook payload. For example, shipments.created webhook events are sent whenever a shipment is created for a business, and contain the new shipment as the payload.\\nWebhook Configuration Action: A persisted data object created using the ChannelApe API, which defines the following:\\n\\n\\nThe action (class of events) that the consumer wants to receive.\\n\\n\\nA Webhook Configuration which defines a subscription endpoint, or the destination where ChannelApe sends webhooks (event messages) for the specified action linked to the specified business.\\n\\n\\nnoteWebhooks are only available on REST API V2 and GraphQL.PreviousWebhooksNextConfigurationWebhook ConceptsCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"RU+7xswNbJz8yWpPA3+5HcmnsJXglmYQlD9sNif7o5E=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"21254986-ba49-436a-bc4e-267574a17842":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"21254986-ba49-436a-bc4e-267574a17842\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/v1api\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"ChannelApe V1 API Documentation | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteError HandlingActionsgetGet actiongetQuery actions by businessputUpdate action with errorputUpdate action health checkputComplete actionAnalyticsgetRetrieve a list of available analyticspostGenerate embed URLBatchespostCreate a new batchgetRetrieve Batch InformationBusinessespostAdd Business MembergetGet BusinessputUpdate BusinessgetGet Businesses for UserdelDelete Business MembergetVerify Business MemberpostCreate BusinessgetGet API AccountgetGet Businesses API AccountsChannelspostCreate custom export channelputUpdate custom export channelgetGet channelgetGet channels for businesspostAdd manual actionFile PreviewspostCreate file previewIntegrationsgetGet integrationgetGet integrationsLocationspostCreate LocationgetGet Locations for a businessputUpdate LocationgetGet LocationputUpdating a location's SLA informationgetGet a location's SLA informationputUpdating a location's closed datesgetGet a location's closed datesLogging PayloadspostLog PayloadInventoriespostCreate Inventory ItemgetGet Inventory Item by SKUputUpdate Inventory ItemgetGet Inventory ItemInventories > QuantitiespostAdjust inventory item quantitypostAdjust inventory item quantity by SKUpostSet inventory item quantitypostSet inventory item quantity by SKUgetRetrieve Inventory Item QuantitiesOrderspostCreate ordergetQuery orders by channelpatchPatch OrderputUpdate orderdelDelete ordergetGet ordergetGet order summaryOrder ActivitiespostCreate an Order ActivityProduct BlocksgetGet product blockgetQuery product blocks by channel IDdelDelete product blockputPut product blockgetQuery product blocks by business ID and product filter IDProduct FiltersputUpdate product filtergetGet  product filterdelDelete product filterpostCreate product filtergetQuery  product filters by business ID and labelProduct ModifierspostCreate product modifiergetGet product modifiers for businessdelDelete  product modifierputUpdate  product modifiergetGet  product modifierProduct PushesgetQuery product pushes by channel IDputPut product push without ordinaldelDelete product pushputPut product pushgetGet product pushProductsputUpdate ProductgetGet ProductpostCreate productRecipesgetGet recipeputUpdate recipepostCreate recipegetQuery recipes by business IDdelDelete recipeSchedulesgetGet schedulepostCreate schedulegetQuery schedules by business IDStepspostCreate stepgetQuery stepsgetGet stepputUpdate stepPlayspostCreate playgetGet All PlaysgetGet PlayputUpdate playSearch FieldspostCreate Search FieldgetGet Businesses Search FieldsgetGet Search FielddelDelete Search FieldputUpdate Search FieldSubscriptionsgetGet subscriptionSuppliersputUpdate supplierpostAdd manual actiongetGet Suppliers for BusinesspostCreate Play Invocation SupplierpostCreate suppliergetGet supplierpostCreate Shopify supplierSuppliers > InventoriespostCreate inventory itemdelDelete inventory itemgetGet inventory items for supplierputUpdate inventory itemgetGet inventory itemSuppliers > InvocationspostInvoke Playbook StepUserspostCreate sessiongetGet sessiongetGet userVariant ReferencesputUpdate variant referencegetGet variant referencedelDelete variant referencepostCreate variant referenceVariantsgetGet VariantgetGet Product's VariantsVariants SearchgetSearch VariantsgetSearch Variants by VendorgetSearch Variants by SKUgetSearch Variants by UPCgetSearch Variants by tagAPI docs by RedoclyChannelApe V1 API Documentation Download OpenAPI specification:DownloadError HandlingInvalid requests will return with a non-200 level status code.

To make this easier, the API has an option to make a future adjustment based on the total inventory you have available to promise. If you have 100 units available to promise currently and you want to reserve 5% of those you can use this field in a future adjustment to take 5% of whatever inventory you have left at the time and reserve it. So if you sell through all 100, there is nothing to reserve.

The biologically active form of chromium participates in glucose metabolism by enhancing the effects of insulin. Insulin is a peptide hormone produced in the beta-cells of the pancreas. It is central to carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Insulin causes the cells in the skeletal muscles, liver, and fat tissue to absorb glucose from the blood. In the liver and skeletal muscles, glucose is stored as glycogen and in fat cells, as triglycerides. Insulin is provided in the body in a constant proportion to remove excess glucose from the blood, which otherwise would be toxic. When blood glucose levels fall below a certain level, the body begins to use stored sugar as an energy source through glycogenolysis, which breaks down the glycogen stored in the liver and muscle into glucose, which can be utilized as an energy source.\\\",\\\"CollectionID\\\": \\\"1005940\\\",\\\"LabeledAsGlutenFree\\\": \\\"0\\\",\\\"ItemName\\\": \\\"Chromium Picolinate\\\",\\\"Height\\\": \\\"4.250\\\",\\\"ItemSize\\\": \\\"100\\\",\\\"Width\\\": \\\"2.000\\\",\\\"StrQtyOnHand\\\": \\\"No\\\",\\\"OrlQtyOnHand\\\": \\\"Yes\\\",\\\"BasicDescription\\\": \\\"CHROMIUM PICOLINATE 200mcg100C\\\",\\\"MAPPrice\\\": \\\"0.00\\\",\\\"ThumbNailURL\\\": \\\"https://www.europasports.com/media/catalog/50/820103309684.gif\\\",\\\"Ingredients\\\": \\\"Gelatin, rice flour.\\\",\\\"ImageURL\\\": \\\"https://www.europasports.com/media/catalog/250/820103309684.jpg\\\",\\\"MesqQtyOnHand\\\": \\\"Yes\\\",\\\"Title\\\": \\\"Nutrakey Chromium Picolinate\\\",\\\"SupplierNumber\\\": \\\"615\\\",\\\"FreQtyOnHand\\\": \\\"Yes\\\",\\\"ItemMeasure\\\": \\\"ea\\\",\\\"Brand\\\": \\\"Nutrakey\\\",\\\"Mass\\\": \\\"0.2\\\",\\\"Image500URL\\\": \\\"https://www.europasports.com/media/catalog/500/820103309684.jpg\\\",\\\"ImageName\\\": \\\"820103309684\\\",\\\"ExtendedSize\\\": \\\"100 Capsules\\\",\\\"SupplierName\\\": \\\"NUTRAKEY\\\",\\\"SuggestedRetailPrice\\\": \\\"8.99\\\",\\\"PostDate\\\": \\\"2013-11-27\\\",\\\"StockCode\\\": \\\"6150062\\\",\\\"Warnings\\\": \\\"Hypoallergenic: contains no yeast, dairy egg, gluten, corn soy, wheat, sugar, starch, salt, preservatives, or artificial color, flavor or fragrance.\\\",\\\"SeaTacQtyOnHand\\\": \\\"No\\\",\\\"SupplierWebAddress\\\": \\\"http://thenutrakey.com/health/shop/\\\"},\\\"categories\\\": {\\\"secondary\\\": \\\"Supplements\\\",\\\"primary\\\": \\\"Weight Loss / Energy\\\"},\\\"alphabeticCurrencyCode\\\": \\\"USD\\\",\\\"businessId\\\": \\\"9b32e7d4-d6a0-4d86-9c5d-9f6094d692c2\\\",\\\"condition\\\": \\\"NEW\\\",\\\"createdAt\\\": \\\"2015-07-29T20:04:00.195Z\\\",\\\"description\\\": \\\"<div class=\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\">Description</div><p>Glucose Metabolism.

This includes Damages or holds for any Quality Control processes like inspection or refurbishment.\\nCOMMITTED - the number of Available to Sell units allocated to an order.\\nThis number increases with each new order allocated to a location and decreases with fulfillments or cancellations.\\nON_ORDER - the number of units that have been shipped to the location but not yet arrived.\\nFor eCommerce channels, like Shopify, this is added to Available to Sell so a limited number of orders can be accepted, even if it's not stocked on hand.\\nRESERVE - the number of units that cannot be used to sell or fulfill orders, typically set aside as a buffer or safety stock. Reserve is another special status that can be used to indiscriminately reduce inventory availability on both channels and warehouse locations.\\nINCOMING - Units in transit to a destination location.\\nUNAVAILABLE - The number of units that are damaged at a location.\\n\\nChannelApe's integrations use these statuses to calculate how much inventory can be used to fulfill an order or is available to purchase on channels like Shopify.\\nThis calculation is referred to as Available to Promise (ATP) and is available in one of two varieties depending on its use:\\nTo fulfill an order:\\nAVAILABLE_TO_PROMISE = AVAILABLE_TO_SELL - RESERVE - COMMITTED\\nFor sale:\\nAVAILABLE_TO_PROMISE = AVAILABLE_TO_SELL + ON_ORDER - RESERVE - COMMITTEDPreviousInventoryNextAggregate Inventory LocationsInventory ItemsInventory StatusesCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"8dvp4d+zOD24voJsKVDnXCOjIxrKB4WbfACi9aMRhRA=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"1ee6954e-48ef-41e3-95f7-83fa15f3a3a5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1ee6954e-48ef-41e3-95f7-83fa15f3a3a5\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/order-activities\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Order Activities | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteIntroductionAPI UsageBusinessesChannelsSuppliersLocationsActionsOrder ActivitiesPlaybookInventoryOrdersShipmentsUpsertsWebhooksOrder ActivitiesOrder ActivitiesActivities can be used to record things about an order.

If any of the parents are\\n        associated with a real time inventory channel, then the current ATP will\\n        also be synchronized to channel.\\n\\n\\n        ## HTTP Status Codes\\n\\n\\n        | Status | Meaning |\\n\\n        | --- | --- |\\n\\n        | 201 | Inventory item quantity has been adjusted successfully |\\n\\n        | 400 | One or more fields provided in the request body are invalid. |\\n\\n        | 404 | Inventory Item could not be found. |\\n      requestBody:\\n        content:\\n          application/json:\\n            schema:\\n              type: object\\n              example:\\n                locationId: 10\\n                sku: Some-New-Sku\\n                inventoryStatus: ON_HOLD\\n                quantity: '15'\\n                effectiveAt: '2019-10-25T19:07:49.088Z'\\n      parameters:\\n        - name: Content-Type\\n          in: header\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n          example: application/json\\n        - name: X-Channel-Ape-Idempotent-Key\\n          in: header\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n          example: '{{$guid}}'\\n        - name: Authorization\\n          in: header\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n          example: Bearor {{token}}\\n      responses:\\n        '201':\\n          description: Created\\n          content:\\n            application/json:\\n              schema:\\n                type: object\\n              example:\\n                adjustment: 100\\n                apiAccountId: '123'\\n                createdAt: '2022-09-13T18:25:34.753Z'\\n                effectiveAt: '2022-09-13T18:25:34.753Z'\\n                inventoryItemId: '100'\\n                inventoryStatus: AVAILABLE_TO_SELL\\n                locationId: '50'\\n                quantity: 100\\n                staged: false\\n                updatedAt: '2022-09-13T18:25:34.753Z'\\n  /v1/inventories/17/quantities:\\n    get:\\n      tags:\\n        - Inventories > Quantities\\n      summary: Retrieve Inventory Item Quantities\\n      description: >-\\n        Retrieves the newest quantities for all the different locations and\\n        statuses.\\n\\n        If an adjustment does not exist yet for a given location/status\\n        combination it will not be returned.\\n\\n\\n        HTTP Status Codes\\n\\n        ---\\n\\n        |Status  | Meaning |\\n\\n        |--|--|\\n\\n        | 200 | Inventory Item exists. |\\n\\n        | 404 | Inventory Item could not be found. |\\n      parameters:\\n        - name: Content-Type\\n          in: header\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n          example: application/json\\n        - name: Authorization\\n          in: header\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n          example: Bearor {{token}}\\n      responses:\\n        '200':\\n          description: Successful response\\n          content:\\n            application/json: {}\\n  /v1/inventories:\\n    post:\\n      tags:\\n        - Inventories\\n      summary: Create Inventory Item\\n      description: >-\\n        ## Required Request Fields\\n\\n\\n        **sku** - Unique identifier for your inventory item up to 100\\n        characters.

When blood glucose levels fall below\\n                  a certain level, the body begins to use stored sugar as an\\n                  energy source through glycogenolysis, which breaks down the\\n                  glycogen stored in the liver and muscle into glucose, which\\n                  can be utilized as an energy source.</p><div\\n                  class=\\\"directions\\\">Directions</div><p>Take one capsule (200\\n                  mcg) with water or your favorite beverage twice daily on an\\n                  empty stomach.

If the answer is yes then we proceed to Order Management Step.\\nWithin Order Management Step we check inventory levels and DOM Rules to see what is available to fulfill and create NEW fulfillments for everything available to ship. The NEW fulfillments are passed to one or many Warehouse - Send Order Steps (i.e. Webhook Send Orders Step)\\nEach warehouse step will look within the Warehouse Location Map to see what locations it is managing and capable of sending orders for. Any NEW fulfillments with a locationId that the Step can handle will be sent to the warehouse. The status will then be updated from NEW to PENDING and COMMITTED inventory will be increased at the location for every line item on the order fulfillment request.\\nLastly the Update ChannelApe Step will commit all changes to ChannelApe (order updates, inventory updates, order activity creation).PreviousOverviewNextStepsOrder Query ParametersTypical StepsExampleCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"wD7eVlGEQ8bmEL1qb2Fu3CuDwcsGwhTiRbLhCBaLt5w=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"550a9abb-6dfc-4d6d-b09f-14310d642dd2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"550a9abb-6dfc-4d6d-b09f-14310d642dd2\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/playbook-webhook-send-orders-play\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Send Order Fulfillment Requests | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteIntroductionAPI UsageBusinessesChannelsSuppliersLocationsActionsOrder ActivitiesPlaybookOverviewPlaysStepsWarehouse Location MapWebhooksSend Order Fulfillment RequestsReceive Fulfillment Order ReceiptsOrder Fulfillment Request RejectionsProcess CancellationsInventoryOrdersShipmentsUpsertsWebhooksPlaybookWebhooksSend Order Fulfillment RequestsOn this pageSend Order Fulfillment RequestsPlaybook allows for sending of orders to one or many warehouses for fulfillment via webhook.\\nConfiguration​\\nInstall the Webhook - Send Orders Playbook Play on a business either via the API or the app.\\nSend Orders Play contains most details needed for configuration.

There are a few endpoints that only exist on the V1 REST API awaiting migration to the new API. You can find the API Reference here.\\nREST API V2 and GraphQL API​\\nOur latest APIs which are accessible via REST or GraphQL. We are actively working on adding support for all endpoints within REST API V1. You can find the API reference for the REST API V2 here. and the API reference for the GraphQL API here.\\nAuthentication​\\nAuthorization Headers​\\nAuthorization - A valid JWT associated with your username or api account.\\napikey - A valid api key. This header should be present on every request.\\nThe API works through a mixture of JWT and Key auth.\\nIf no Authorization header is included, the API will assume that you are making a request with an anonymous user.\\nIf an Authorization header is included, the API will \\\"switch\\\" to the role of the user or api account making the request.\\n\\nANON_KEY - The public API key shared by all users. Required by all API calls.\\nYOUR_KEY - The JSON Web Token (JWT) associated with your username or api account. Required to call any APIs specific to a business.\\n\\nExample request:\\ncurl 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/webhook_actions' \\\\-H \\\"apikey: ANON_KEY\\\" \\\\-H \\\"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY\\\"\\nCreating an API Account​\\nYou can create an API account to access your businesses resources across ChannelApe API's. To do this, you need be the owner of the business. Run the following command:\\ncurl 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/rpc/create_api_account' \\\\-d '{ \\\"business_id\\\": \\\"c8c6bcfa-f544-4680-bbf3-7d93aee95efa\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"My API Account\\\" }' \\\\-H \\\"apikey: ANON_KEY\\\" \\\\-H \\\"Content-Type: application/vnd.pgrst.object+json\\\" \\\\-H \\\"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY\\\"\\nThis will create your API account private key. Note, that this is only shown once, so ensure you save it.\\nOnce you have your API secret you can 'login' with your API account. This essentially generates a short-lived (4 hour) JWT that can be used like any other JWT in the system.\\nExample login request:\\ncurl -X POST 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/rpc/login_api_account' \\\\-d '{ \\\"account_id\\\": \\\"value\\\", \\\"secret\\\": \\\"value\\\" }' \\\\-H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\-H \\\"apikey: ANON_KEY\\\" \\\\\\nJSON Web Tokens (JWTs)​\\nJWTs expire after a certain amount of time and need to be refreshed before they expire. If you need require long term API Access and are unable to refresh your JWT regularly please email support@channelape.com.\\nRate Limiting​\\nAPI users are restricted to a rate limit. ChannelApe businesses have a default limit of 5 requests per second across all of the API Accounts of a business. When a request is rate limited, a 429 level status code will be returned. If you need an increased rate limit, please email support@channelape.com.PreviousIntroductionNextBusinessesAvailable APIsREST API V1REST API V2 and GraphQL APIAuthenticationAuthorization HeadersCreating an API AccountJSON Web Tokens (JWTs)Rate LimitingCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3462,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"l0lHTiKUxjA73KJDD1cdj51otDZvu8+PXg6rtpOh+Gs=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"97714581-5acc-468a-981b-765f82e206c8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"97714581-5acc-468a-981b-765f82e206c8\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/pos-and-stos\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"4641a965-0fc0-4416-bc2c-a8160df9e26c\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/pos-and-stos\"},\"hash\":\"z/6yZf/2i6Ilojgw2BXNV+M9Xd0AY5obcM7eXWygeRU=\"}},\"text\":\"POs and STOs | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteIntroductionAPI UsageBusinessesChannelsSuppliersLocationsActionsOrder ActivitiesPlaybookInventoryOrdersShipmentsOverviewPOs and STOsSales OrdersShipment StatusShipment Inventory AdjustmentsShipment CreationShipment WebhooksShipment Receipt CreationShipment Receipt WebhooksShipment AllocationsUpsertsWebhooksShipmentsPOs and STOsOn this pagePOs and STOsA stock transfer order is a request to transfer inventory between locations, while a purchase order is a request to purchase goods or services from a supplier.

ActivitiesPlaybookInventoryOrdersShipmentsUpsertsOverviewWorkflowWebhooksUpsertsWorkflowOn this pageWorkflowUnlike insert and update operations, the behavior of upsert can vary\\nsignificantly across different vendors, if supported at all.This documentation\\npage provides an overview of how our implementation of upsert works.Details for each upsert operation can be found in the API Reference.Searching​\\nThe general structure of a models typically consist of the following fields:\\n\\nid: a unique identifier for the model within the ChannelApe platform.external_ids: a key-value map of external identifiers for the model, such as\\n{\\\"WAREHOUSE_DALLAS_ID\\\": \\\"12345\\\", \\\"SHIPPING_COMPANY_ID\\\": \\\"54321\\\"}.business_id: the unique identifier for the business that owns the model.When you send a model to us, we first attempt to find an existing model that\\nmatches the one you provided.The found match must be unique to be considered\\nusable.The matching conditions are evaluated in the following order:\\n\\nid\\nexternal_ids\\nNatural keys\\n\\nID​\\nIf you include the id field, we will search for a model with that specific\\nidentifier.Supplying the id indicates that you already know the model you are\\nlooking for.If it doesn't exist, we will create a new model with the supplied\\nid value.Note ids are GUIDs (globally unique identifiers) and are in the form\\nxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.Use a library for your platform to\\ngenerate these values if you must know the id before creating the model.It's generally not recommended to use this method.Because id is a globally unique identifier no other search conditions are\\nevaluated if.The rest of the criteria below \\\"fall through\\\" if they don't match.External IDs​\\nExternal IDs are a key-value map of external identifiers for the model.You only\\nneed to provide a subset of the external IDs.For example, if your model has the\\nfollowing external_ids:\\n{  \\\"KEY_1\\\": \\\"value_1\\\",  \\\"KEY_2\\\": \\\"value_2\\\"}\\nYou can submit the following input:\\n{  \\\"external_ids\\\": {    \\\"KEY_1\\\": \\\"value_1\\\"  }}\\nThe model will match on KEY_1 as the values are equal.However, including\\nmultiple keys might cause the model to not be found, for example:\\n{  \\\"external_ids\\\": {    \\\"KEY_1\\\": \\\"value_1\\\",    \\\"KEY_2\\\": \\\"new_value\\\"  }}\\nWould not match as both KEY_1 and KEY_2 must match the values provided.At the time of writing, external IDs are not supported for all models.Also no\\nguarantee is made that external IDs are unique.The key of external id's is\\nsupposed to be the context in which it's used.For example if during inventory\\nprocessing you need to reference an identifier from your warehouse management\\nsystem, you could use\\n{\\\"INVENTORY_PROCESSING_ID\\\": \\\"[ID_FROM_WAREHOUSE_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM]\\\"}.This\\ncan only work as well as the id you provide is unique in the context.If the\\nunderlying system returns the same id for multiple items, upsert will likely\\nfail to find a unique match.Natural Keys​\\nNatural keys are a set of fields that uniquely identify a model based on their\\ninherent characteristics.For example, in the context of inventory items, the\\nsku or in the context of locations, the name could be considered natural\\nkeys.Although these values are not truly unique in most cases, they are\\ntypically unique within a specific context.Context Values​\\nAny key that identifies a parent resource, also known as a foreign key, is used\\nto narrow down the search domain.For instance, the business_id represents the\\nID of the business that owns the model.Suppose your account has access to a\\nsingle business, and you send the following request:\\n{  \\\"inventory_item\\\": {    \\\"sku\\\": \\\"sku-123\\\",    \\\"title\\\": \\\"New Title\\\"  }}\\nIn this case, the same inventory item will always be found because the sku is\\nunique per business.However, if your account gains access to another business\\nand sends the same request, there is a chance that the inventory item will be\\nfound in the other business.This is because the sku is not globally unique,\\nbut unique within each business.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"m2+EKJRzHNY7y3m0lISvMiURvRqw20ROcpbsbSRtDWY=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4e03f38f-68cd-4990-abc8-e74e4b56e325":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4e03f38f-68cd-4990-abc8-e74e4b56e325\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/upserts-workflow\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"d48dbf43-4a1f-4eb2-bf29-256ee9eacd6a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/upserts-workflow\"},\"hash\":\"cMhnqiPjarloHKgpoYMz6YIJag05d1vj37ThiTAjVh0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"cf0981cf-2ea9-46c5-b446-c1ef8164256e\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/upserts-workflow\"},\"hash\":\"m2+EKJRzHNY7y3m0lISvMiURvRqw20ROcpbsbSRtDWY=\"}},\"text\":\"Although

upsert_shipments_full will automatically set the business_id for\\naddresses, locations, shipment items, and so on, when performing their\\nrespective upsert operations.It's not suggested to set context values in\\nnested models unless you specifically want to move a model from one business\\nto another.Inserting​\\nIf no model is found, we will create a new one.The model will be created with\\nthe values provided in the request body.All fields marked as required must be\\nprovided, except for id.Updating​\\nIf a unique model is found, we will update it with the values provided in the\\nrequest body.In the update scenario all fields are optional except for\\nidentifier information discussed in search.By default the model will be patched.This means that only the fields you\\nprovide will be updated.If you want to replace the entire model, you can set\\nthe patch field to false.This will replace the entire model with the one you\\nsend us.Do note that this will remove any fields you don't send us.The exception to this rule is any required fields will be copied over from the\\nexisting model.External Ids​\\nRegardless of that patch value, external IDs will always be patched and merged\\nwith the existing external IDs.On key collision, the value in the request will\\noverwrite the existing value.If you really want to replace the entire external IDs map, use the patch method\\nprovided by the rest api directly or mutate via the graphql api.Result​\\nRegardless of whether a model was inserted or updated, the response will always\\nbe the entire model as it's stored in the system.The result is identical to\\ncalling the post method on the rest api directly.Best Practices​\\nIf you have the id of an existing model, use it.This requires no further\\ncontext and is the most efficient way to upsert a model.If you don't, use the external_ids field and provide as many context\\nidentifiers as possible.At the very minimum business_id should be provided as\\nwell.In some cases natural keys are better than external IDs.By there very nature\\nthis should be apparent although efforts in documenting this by function are\\nongoing.Additional Notes​\\nSafety​\\nUpsert is a non destructive operation, tt will never delete a model.This may\\nchange in the future but it'll be opt-in with a delete flag.Upsert is also acid compliant, if the\\nrequest fails, no changes will be made to the system regardless of the\\ncomplexity of the model.Permissions​\\nUpsert has no knowledge of the current permissions of the user executing it.It\\nalso doesn't have elevated permissions.This means that it can only select,\\ncreate and update models that the executing user has access to.It'll also\\nblindly attempt to do these operations on your behalf failing the operation if\\nyou don't have the required permissions.Summary​\\nAlways keep in mind that upsert is a best effort operation.If you provide\\nsufficient information to uniquely identify a model the operation will\\ngenerally behave as expected.PreviousOverviewNextWebhooksSearchingIDExternal IDsNatural KeysContext ValuesInsertingUpdatingExternal IdsResultBest

This means that if you send us a model and\\nwe can identify a unique instance of it we will update it, otherwise we will\\ncreate a new one.\\n\\nNote: Upsert trades control for convenience. It's really intended for\\nlow-code/no-code integrations. It works on best effort basis and will attempt\\nto do the right thing where possible. If you need more control, use the\\naforementioned rest or graphql endpoints. But it is a great way to get started\\nquickly.\\n\\nGeneral Upsert Structure​\\nThe upsert structure is generally the same for all models. It is a simple JSON\\nobject with two fields:\\n\\npatch: an optional boolean indicating whether or not to patch the model\\n(defaults to true) see more\\n[entity_name]: partial model you want to upsert, this differs per model\\n\\nThe url for the upsert endpoint will be the same as the rest endpoint but with\\n/rpc/upsert_[entity_name] appended to it. You can find all the upsert\\nendpoints in the API Reference.\\nWe'll go over each of these in detail later but for now let's look at an\\nexample. Here is an example request against the inventory item upsert endpoint:\\nPOST https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/rpc/upsert_inventory_item  HTTP/1.1Content-Type: application/jsonapikey: ANON_KEYAuthorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY{    \\\"inventory_item\\\": {    \\\"business_id\\\": \\\"[your_business_id]\\\",    \\\"sku\\\": \\\"sku_123\\\",    \\\"title\\\": \\\"New Title\\\",  }}\\nHere is what the result will be:\\n{  \\\"id\\\": \\\"[unique_id]\\\",  \\\"sku\\\": \\\"sku_123\\\",  \\\"title\\\": \\\"New Title\\\",  \\\"business_id\\\": \\\"[your_business_id]\\\",  \\\"legacy_id\\\": null}\\nYou may call this endpoint as many times as you like and it will always return\\nthe same result. If you change the title to \\\"New Title 2\\\" and call it again, it\\nwill update the title and return the same result.\\nThis is because the sku field is unique for inventory items. If you change the\\nsku field to something else, it will create a new inventory item. Why does it\\nmatter if sku is unique? Well to explain that, we need to go over how upsert\\nworks in the next section.\\nnoteUpserts are only available on REST API V2 and GraphQL.PreviousUpsertsNextWorkflowGeneral Upsert StructureCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2633,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"/Va8srFXYHhWS/ZHL1xSLmD29MSMOLD6R2vcdwLxQ4g=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"75615892-31c3-4b16-9951-15e461e9ffb6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"75615892-31c3-4b16-9951-15e461e9ffb6\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/category/playbook\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"1f9a1bfc-91d6-44be-be92-00395663a15a\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/category/playbook\"},\"hash\":\"bolNvnfOCux7D4BYtHMsKxQZlCg6SlLLqWXxzH9XEJM=\"}},\"text\":\"Playbook | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteIntroductionAPI UsageBusinessesChannelsSuppliersLocationsActionsOrder ActivitiesPlaybookOverviewPlaysStepsWarehouse Location MapWebhooksInventoryOrdersShipmentsUpsertsWebhooksPlaybookPlaybookWorkflow engine built for retail enterprise operations.📄️ OverviewAn introduction to playbook.🗃️ Plays2 items🗃️ Steps4 items📄️ Warehouse Location MapWarehouse information needed by playbook.🗃️ Webhooks4 itemsPreviousOrder ActivitiesNextOverviewCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":605,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"QHklG6sYm1POy/v6yYhah1YsgRQlj71MAiPfxKSPS4k=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5815e030-bd4e-4700-9d6b-3dcafdcdfdaf":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5815e030-bd4e-4700-9d6b-3dcafdcdfdaf\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/shipments-overview\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"3c0c0325-e44b-4af6-89cc-fef308d7dbcd\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/shipments-overview\"},\"hash\":\"ZwMrLsRRIhzvfjf/qCKdi7+bX4CJ7xcJFRPny0YezzY=\"}},\"text\":\"Overview | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteIntroductionAPI UsageBusinessesChannelsSuppliersLocationsActionsOrder ActivitiesPlaybookInventoryOrdersShipmentsOverviewPOs and STOsSales OrdersShipment StatusShipment Inventory AdjustmentsShipment CreationShipment WebhooksShipment Receipt CreationShipment Receipt WebhooksShipment AllocationsUpsertsWebhooksShipmentsOverviewOn this pageOverviewShipments can either represent what we are sending to a warehouse in the form of an Advance Ship Notice heading to the warehouse or what we received back from a warehouse in the form of a fulfillment order receipt.

You can view all available actions here:\\ncurl 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/webhook_actions' \\\\-H \\\"apikey: ANON_KEY\\\" \\\\-H \\\"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY\\\"\\nConfigurations​\\nDecide which business you would like to receive webhooks for and were you want to send the events. Set the URL where you want to receive webhook events as the hook_consumer_url below.\\nCreate the webhook with the call here:\\ncurl -X POST 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/webhook_configurations' \\\\-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\\-H 'apikey: ANON_KEY' \\\\-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY' \\\\-d '{  \\\"business_id\\\" : \\\"0ba2563e-92fa-41e8-98e1-97361c3e608a\\\",  \\\"hook_consumer_url\\\" : \\\"https://webhook.site/1ce3e263-2116-48f7-a57c-ea1c240499b7\\\"}'\\nConfiguration Actions​\\nOnce you have a webhook endpoint configured for a business, you can subscribe it to one or many actions.\\nFirst find the webhook_configuration_id using this request to get all of the configurations for a business using the call here:\\ncurl 'curl 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/webhook_configurations?business_id=eq.YOUR_BUSINESS_ID' \\\\' \\\\-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\\-H \\\"apikey: ANON_KEY\\\" \\\\-H \\\"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY\\\"\\nThen subscribe the configuration to an action using the below call replacing the webhook_configuration_id with your value from the previous step using the call here:\\ncurl -X POST 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/webhook_configuration_actions' \\\\-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\\-H \\\"apikey: ANON_KEY\\\" \\\\-H \\\"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY\\\" \\\\-d '{  \\\"webhook_configuration_id\\\" : \\\"bdd307a8-8488-4f37-a5c2-da04e3d0d736\\\",  \\\"action\\\" : \\\"shipment.updated.status\\\",  \\\"capture_snapshot\\\": false}'\\nCapture Snapshots​\\nInitially when webhooks launched, we captured the entire snapshot of the order as it was updated. However, this proved costly on larger objects, so to add a middle ground, we added a flag to actions that will only send the current state of the object as the webhook fires. Note that webhooks fire on a cron every minute, so if you have multiple updates in between minutes, you'd only see on model(you will still receive n number of webhooks though).\\nLarge Webhooks​\\nYou'll notice that we default the producer_url to our service provider for handling webhooks. However, there is 300kb limit on these, so anything over that will go directly to the hook_consumer_url.\\nPortal​\\nOnce you configure the above you should be ready to receive webhook payloads for the actions specified at the given hook consumer url.\\nWe expose a portal for you to debug delivery as well as inspect and replay past webhooks.\\nYou can gain access to this portal for a few days with the call here:\\ncurl -X POST 'https://api.channelape.io/rest/v1/rpc/create_webhook_portal_magic_link' \\\\-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\\-H \\\"apikey: ANON_KEY\\\" \\\\-H \\\"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY\\\" \\\\-d '{  \\\"business_id\\\" : \\\"bdd307a8-8488-4f37-a5c2-da04e3d0d736\\\"}'\\ntipReview webhooks advanced to learn more about the capabilities of the portal.PreviousOverviewNextAdvancedAvailable ActionsConfigurationsConfiguration ActionsCapture SnapshotsLarge WebhooksPortalCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3634,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ivZR8XMUHd8iJ+tAlCaoJxO4Byyz0v6ROB9wd68O2/U=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3031347f-4e4b-4a26-a66a-39a859248fdf":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3031347f-4e4b-4a26-a66a-39a859248fdf\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/sales-orders\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"86e1222c-5c54-40c5-98e9-38b5eb424419\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/sales-orders\"},\"hash\":\"LzhE74/gXPiGFUsgNNMx1EvA0g7rogDiCkORTCu605E=\"}},\"text\":\"Sales Orders | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteIntroductionAPI UsageBusinessesChannelsSuppliersLocationsActionsOrder ActivitiesPlaybookInventoryOrdersShipmentsOverviewPOs and STOsSales OrdersShipment StatusShipment Inventory AdjustmentsShipment CreationShipment WebhooksShipment Receipt CreationShipment Receipt WebhooksShipment AllocationsUpsertsWebhooksShipmentsSales OrdersOn this pageSales OrdersA sales order is a document generated by a seller specifying the details about the products or services ordered by a customer, including quantity, price, and delivery terms.\\nRelationships​\\nA Sales Order can be represented with an Order.\\nA Warehouse Order Fulfillment Request can be represented with an Order Fulfillment Request.

management is a sophisticated way of managing your sales channel or b2b orders that also ties into your inventory management.This article outlines what configuration and fields are important to get the most out of the ChannelApe ecosystem.Channel Setup​\\nInstall your favorite channel and pull in orders or create a webhook channel to place created orders.Orders can not exist outside of a channel currently.If you want to enable automated inventory adjustments(see below) when orders occur ensure you have a location set on the channel.Location is an optional field on the channel but it should look something like below./v1/orders POST\\n{    \\\"additionalFields\\\": [],    \\\"businessId\\\": \\\"0ba2563e-92fa-41e8-98e1-97361c3e608a\\\",    \\\"createdAt\\\":

\\\"updateFields\\\": []    },    \\\"updatedAt\\\": \\\"2021-07-01T09:35:59.107Z\\\"}\\nOrder statuses and their meaning​\\n\\nOPEN - The order has been placed but there is still a chance to make changes.Usually used in playbook with our Customer Service Window functionality that allows CX agents to be able to make a change to an order before the order is sent to the warehouse.HOLD - Their is something wrong with the order and it has been placed in this status for a CX team member to review.Possibly issues would be around shipping address being invalid.IN_PROGRESS - The order has been fully or partially sent to the warehouse to be fulfilled.It's ideal that no changes come into the order at this point unless the warehouse supports it, but this is rare.CLOSED - The order has been fulfilled completely or the order has been closed on the channel.Once in this status, there is nothing else to do with the order, and these are filtered out of most of ChannelApe processing.CANCELED - The order has been canceled by either the customer or the warehouse.Creating an Order​\\nTo get an order into the order management system you need to create it in ChannelApe.There are a few fields to note when creating an order.Order level fields​\\n\\nchannelOrderId - The external identifier for the order.This needs to be unique per business.purchaseOrderNumber - The purchase order number for the order.This is optional and can be shared across orders but generally should be unique as well.channel - The channel you created above\\nstatus - The current status of the order.Ideally should be placed in OPEN and let the ChannelApe order management system take it the rest of the way.purchasedAt - The time the order was placed.alphabeticCurrencyCode - The three letter ISO 4217 currency code.(USD, CAD)\\n\\nCustomer​\\nInformation about the customer.The main thing ChannelApe uses here are the shipping and billing address.But these fields can also further identify the customer for the order.email\\nphone\\nname\\n\\nCustomer Address (Shipping and Billing Address)​\\n\\naddress1\\naddress2\\ncity\\nprovince\\nprovinceCode\\ncountry\\ncountryCode\\npostalCode\\n\\nLine Items​\\nEach order placed needs at least one item.id - a unique identifier, that is required.This is how ChannelApe will try to identify line items.sku - A string that represents a product.If you want automated inventory adjustments, then this should match inventory item sku in the ChannelApe Inventory Management system.It will keep track of quantities of all skus on the order that the system knows about and ignore the rest.quantity - The quantity being ordered.Note: that once created you can only increase this number.ChannelApe API will prevent you from reducing this number.price - the cost * quantity ordered.Finally, the order should look something like this when creating it.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"LMhb8JAPOJC4ni/02PTQCuJyTLw2Esazn12WNa/Vm+I=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"44ad8088-0e54-4d57-b0b0-22d9ba5bb5d0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"44ad8088-0e54-4d57-b0b0-22d9ba5bb5d0\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/orders-best-practices\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"4f9081b8-08de-47b6-94af-818cba1321be\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/orders-best-practices\"},\"hash\":\"HuCcrB0leXv2DcZxhB3En6Mcaglgz7xb6CHQRn+Nsw0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5dd21bf7-cf70-4d2c-92e7-e1ee49da40d7\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/orders-best-practices\"},\"hash\":\"LMhb8JAPOJC4ni/02PTQCuJyTLw2Esazn12WNa/Vm+I=\"}},\"text\":\"But

order are the way to identify when an item on the order is shipped.If you are responsible for creating fulfilllments on a ChannelApe order, there a few important things to keep in mind.Fulfillment Statuses and their meanings​\\n\\nPENDING - The fulfillment that is usually created when it is sent to the warehouse.OPEN - The fulfillment was received back from the warehouse and has enough information to pass back to the channel.If you are not using external systems to communicate the fulfillment, you most likely do not need this status.SUCCESS - The fulfillment has all of the tracking information and no more information is needed.Fulfillment level fields​\\n\\nid - All fulfillments need an ID.This field is technically not required currently but going forward it will be generated for you if you do not pass one in.lineItems - See above\\ntrackingNumber - The tracking number for the shipment\\nshippingMethod - The method for which the box is shipping.shippingCompany - the company that will be handling the shipping.You can use /v1/orders PATCH\\n{    \\\"fulfillments\\\": [        {            \\\"id\\\": \\\"456\\\",            \\\"lineItems\\\": [                {

adjustments​\\nIf you follow the above the following inventory adjustments should automatically happen.Note that these only happen if the location is set on the channel and the line item sku is found in channelape.ActionAdjustment(s)Order is created in channelape+1 committed for each item * quantityOrder is updated with a new line item+1 committed for the new item * quantityLine Item quantity is

Locations can be either physical or virtual. Physical locations have a physical address and contain quantities of goods, such as a 3PL, Repair Facility, or Retail Store. Virtual locations, on the other hand, do not have a physical address and are used to aggregate inventory between one or more physical locations. This allows for the creation of a single stream of ecommerce inventory that can be sold across multiple channels.\\n10..*10..*LocationInventoryItemsInventoryItemQuantityAdjustmentsPreviousSuppliersNextActionsCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":888,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"ue0hders1m5cngBXsS8ABRXVzBPjF46HR5UWdG1u7K4=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e224f8ce-1757-4dc4-8850-9d1fda322916":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e224f8ce-1757-4dc4-8850-9d1fda322916\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/webhooks-overview\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"dd403c9a-1fa0-49cd-ae7f-dac81a05f32f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/webhooks-overview\"},\"hash\":\"RU+7xswNbJz8yWpPA3+5HcmnsJXglmYQlD9sNif7o5E=\"}},\"text\":\"Overview | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteIntroductionAPI UsageBusinessesChannelsSuppliersLocationsActionsOrder ActivitiesPlaybookInventoryOrdersShipmentsUpsertsWebhooksOverviewConfigurationAdvancedWebhooksOverviewOn this pageOverviewWebhooks allow apps to stay in sync with ChannelApe data or perform an action after a specific event occurs on a business. Webhooks are a performant alternative to continuously polling for changes.\\nFor example, a webhook can notify your app when a user updates a shipment. Your app can then perform an action when the shipment change occurs.\\nThis guide introduces how webhooks work, including how to configure a webhook for your app and manage webhooks.\\nWebhook Concepts​\\nTo help orient you with the content in this guide, the following definitions explain webhook concepts:\\nWebhook Configuration: Links a webhook endpoint (hook consumer url) to a business.\\nWebhook: A single event message. ChannelApe sends a webhook to an webhook configuration's hook consumer url. A webhook contains a JSON payload in the body, and metadata in the headers.\\nWebhook Action: A class of webhook events. An action controls when webhook events are created and what's in the webhook payload. For example, shipments.created webhook events are sent whenever a shipment is created for a business, and contain the new shipment as the payload.\\nWebhook Configuration Action: A persisted data object created using the ChannelApe API, which defines the following:\\n\\n\\nThe action (class of events) that the consumer wants to receive.\\n\\n\\nA Webhook Configuration which defines a subscription endpoint, or the destination where ChannelApe sends webhooks (event messages) for the specified action linked to the specified business.\\n\\n\\nnoteWebhooks are only available on REST API V2 and GraphQL.PreviousWebhooksNextConfigurationWebhook ConceptsCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe,

If you have 100 units available to promise currently and you want to reserve 5% of those you can use this field in a future adjustment to take 5% of whatever inventory you have left at the time and reserve it.

See the side effects section below.\\nmemo - A note to describe why the adjustment was possibly made. Limit of 1000 characters.\\neffectiveAt - The time the adjustment should be effective. If this is in the future, this will be staged and inserted into the adjustment history log at the effective time. This can be useful for expiring adjustments by creating an adjustment that offsets an existing one.\\nChannelApe does allow setting effective dates in the past, but does not rewrite the adjustment history. It will be placed in the history log at the time the adjustment is made.\\nFor more on inventory adjustments and how they work in ChannelApe see our Inventory Management documentation.\\nSide Effects\\nIf the location you are making an adjustment for is the child of one or more parent locations and the aggregateChannelSync flag is set to true, then for each parent, it will sum up all of the adjusted statuses current quantities from all of the parents child locations, including the new adjustment that was just made and will set that value as the current value for the parent location. If any of the parents are associated with a real time inventory channel, then the current ATP will also be synchronized to channel.\\nHTTP Status Codes\\n\\n\\n\\nStatus\\nMeaning\\n\\n\\n\\n201\\nInventory item quantity has been adjusted successfully\\n\\n\\n400\\nOne or more fields provided in the request body are invalid.\\n\\n\\n404\\nInventory Item could not be found.\\n\\n\\nheader ParametersContent-Typestring  Example:  application/jsonX-Channel-Ape-Idempotent-Keystring  Example:  {{$guid}}Authorizationstring  Example:  Bearor {{token}}Request Body schema: application/jsonobject Responses201 Created\\npost/v1/inventories/quantities/setshttps://api.channelape.com/v1/inventories/quantities/sets Request samples PayloadContent typeapplication/jsonCopy{\\\"locationId\\\": 10,\\\"sku\\\": \\\"Some-New-Sku\\\",\\\"inventoryStatus\\\": \\\"ON_HOLD\\\",\\\"quantity\\\": \\\"15\\\",\\\"effectiveAt\\\": \\\"2019-10-25T19:07:49.088Z\\\"} Response samples 201Content typeapplication/jsonCopy{\\\"adjustment\\\": 100,\\\"apiAccountId\\\": \\\"123\\\",\\\"createdAt\\\": \\\"2022-09-13T18:25:34.753Z\\\",\\\"effectiveAt\\\": \\\"2022-09-13T18:25:34.753Z\\\",\\\"inventoryItemId\\\": \\\"100\\\",\\\"inventoryStatus\\\": \\\"AVAILABLE_TO_SELL\\\",\\\"locationId\\\": \\\"50\\\",\\\"quantity\\\": 100,\\\"staged\\\": false,\\\"updatedAt\\\": \\\"2022-09-13T18:25:34.753Z\\\"}Retrieve Inventory Item Quantities Retrieves the newest quantities for all the different locations and statuses.\\nIf an adjustment does not exist yet for a given location/status combination it will not be returned.\\nHTTP Status Codes\\n\\n\\n\\nStatus\\nMeaning\\n\\n\\n\\n200\\nInventory Item exists.\\n\\n\\n404\\nInventory Item could not be found.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"startCharIdx\":88154,\"endCharIdx\":92337,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"UFMvDIdOvc+hgvnIwMsnshF+YnKtWFuB4/PDj5MdZqI=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d813b37c-e11b-4fd4-8c4b-ddc902135c88":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d813b37c-e11b-4fd4-8c4b-ddc902135c88\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/v1api\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"21254986-ba49-436a-bc4e-267574a17842\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/v1api\"},\"hash\":\"MgD34XWjDOdfcpebimkNtZhTR37CuPi7mhvS5ltcGX8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"02ce81e6-5799-4685-b5c7-e540af4758cf\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/v1api\"},\"hash\":\"ua2i6KV2uat3uUzsBBAhfAskItD6CXbQrraP6TBG+ZI=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"869dc27d-111c-4ab2-aa81-e0d74a6d2a81\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"yptXS5kp0WNoLmjUMhC+CAz8O9VBtVnFNmLWueSBptg=\"}},\"text\":\"Status\\nMeaning\\n\\n\\n\\n200\\nInventory Item exists.\\n\\n\\n404\\nInventory Item could not be found.\\n\\n\\nheader ParametersContent-Typestring  Example:  application/jsonAuthorizationstring  Example:  Bearor {{token}}Responses200 Successful response\\nget/v1/inventories/17/quantitieshttps://api.channelape.com/v1/inventories/17/quantitiesOrdersAn order is transaction that was placed on either your website or marketplace.

usageOrdersShipmentsUpsertsWebhooksInventoryOverviewOn this pageOverviewChannelape supports syncing of inventory to warehouse locations and for aggregate syncing of inventory to virtual locations linked to channels like Shopify.\\nThe Inventory Management System (IMS) is a software tool that helps businesses track and manage their inventory levels.\\nIt allows users to see real-time data on inventory levels, track orders, and make adjustments to inventory as needed.\\nThe IMS can be used to manage inventory for multiple warehouses and locations, and can integrate with other systems such as our Order Management System (OMS) to streamline the fulfillment process.\\nThis article explains the relationship between the Inventory Items, Locations, and Statuses used in our Inventory Management System.\\nSee our Knowledge Base for more details.\\nInventory Items​\\nAn Inventory Item is used to represent items you are selling or fulfilling. They can be tangible goods like inventory shipped from your warehouse or digital like a bundle.\\nInventory Items can be created in one of three ways\\n\\nCreate Inventory Item API\\nAdjust or Set Inventory Item Quantity by SKU API\\nCreate Batch API\\n\\nOnce an Inventory Item has been created, it needs to be associated with a location\\nInventory Statuses​\\nInventory balances are tracked by status and location.\\nThe supported statuses are:\\n\\nON_HAND - the number of units currently in a location regardless of its disposition.\\nAVAILABLE_TO_SELL - the number of units that can be sold.\\nChannelApe expects Available to Sell to be exclusive of On Hold and On Order, and inclusive of Committed.\\nON_HOLD - the number of units on hand that cannot be sold.

to know exactly what quantities you want to set and expire in the future, especially in bulk.To make this easier, the API has an option to make a future adjustment based on the total inventory you have available to promise.If you have 100 units available to promise currently and you want to reserve 5% of those you can use this field in a future adjustment to take 5% of whatever inventory you have left at the time and reserve it.So if you sell through all 100, there is nothing to reserve.If you don't sell through any and still have 100 units, it will reserve 10 leaving you 90 units to sell.\\\\n\\\\nFor more on inventory adjustments and how they work in ChannelApe see our [Inventory Management

for is the child of one or more parent locations and aggregateChannelSync flag is true, the same relative adjustment will be made to each parent location.Ie.+1 on the child, then a +1 for each parent.If any of the parents are associated with a real time inventory channel, then the current ATP will also be synchronized to channel.\\\\n\\\\n## HTTP Status Codes\\\\n\\\\n| Status | Meaning

If any of the parents are\\n        associated with a real time inventory channel, then the current ATP will\\n        also be synchronized to channel.\\n\\n\\n        ## HTTP Status Codes\\n\\n\\n        | Status | Meaning |\\n\\n        | --- | --- |\\n\\n        | 201 | Inventory item quantity has been adjusted successfully |\\n\\n        | 400 | One or more fields provided in the request body are invalid. |\\n\\n        | 404 | Inventory Item could not be found. |\\n      requestBody:\\n        content:\\n          application/json:\\n            schema:\\n              type: object\\n              example:\\n                locationId: 10\\n                sku: Some-New-Sku\\n                inventoryStatus: ON_HOLD\\n                quantity: '15'\\n                effectiveAt: '2019-10-25T19:07:49.088Z'\\n      parameters:\\n        - name: Content-Type\\n          in: header\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n          example: application/json\\n        - name: X-Channel-Ape-Idempotent-Key\\n          in: header\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n          example: '{{$guid}}'\\n        - name: Authorization\\n          in: header\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n          example: Bearor {{token}}\\n      responses:\\n        '201':\\n          description: Created\\n          content:\\n            application/json:\\n              schema:\\n                type: object\\n              example:\\n                adjustment: 100\\n                apiAccountId: '123'\\n                createdAt: '2022-09-13T18:25:34.753Z'\\n                effectiveAt: '2022-09-13T18:25:34.753Z'\\n                inventoryItemId: '100'\\n                inventoryStatus: AVAILABLE_TO_SELL\\n                locationId: '50'\\n                quantity: 100\\n                staged: false\\n                updatedAt: '2022-09-13T18:25:34.753Z'\\n  /v1/inventories/17/quantities:\\n    get:\\n      tags:\\n        - Inventories > Quantities\\n      summary: Retrieve Inventory Item Quantities\\n      description: >-\\n        Retrieves the newest quantities for all the different locations and\\n        statuses.\\n\\n        If an adjustment does not exist yet for a given location/status\\n        combination it will not be returned.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"startCharIdx\":124862,\"endCharIdx\":129224,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"Lwmm3go7BZinOl2dBoHBJL+WE0YMpGM/h2Xne5qapPM=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e46b3dcf-8f70-4371-a278-4ccbcfed50f6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e46b3dcf-8f70-4371-a278-4ccbcfed50f6\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/redocusaurus/plugin-redoc-1.yaml\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"e8b2f22f-931b-4f64-a2b8-015b1c34f969\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/redocusaurus/plugin-redoc-1.yaml\"},\"hash\":\"ma3uOmXOVvE+L+TekIzBmeISrcNFTrROcKSaT+WpUAE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f533867a-6a1a-433f-b933-9e949f748692\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/redocusaurus/plugin-redoc-1.yaml\"},\"hash\":\"ZsVHOe1BSmLd7YJpEC2JBLmdYPxe7SWq/LzB5TziwBk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"a1eca517-063f-4ffa-a903-0f70a5d6627a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"X6ErBWLE/He2/xKPSWrWGZxSaQNFrRf3WDdOjc1S91g=\"}},\"text\":\"HTTP Status Codes\\n\\n        ---\\n\\n        |Status  | Meaning |\\n\\n        |--|--|\\n\\n        | 200 | Inventory Item exists. |\\n\\n        | 404 | Inventory Item could not be found. |\\n      parameters:\\n        - name: Content-Type\\n          in: header\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n          example: application/json\\n        - name: Authorization\\n          in: header\\n          schema:\\n            type: string\\n          example: Bearor {{token}}\\n      responses:\\n        '200':\\n          description: Successful response\\n          content:\\n            application/json: {}\\n  /v1/inventories:\\n    post:\\n      tags:\\n        - Inventories\\n      summary: Create Inventory Item\\n      description: >-\\n        ## Required Request Fields\\n\\n\\n        **sku** - Unique identifier for your inventory item up to 100\\n        characters.

These can be setup via the API or within the ChannelApe App on the Locations page.\\nSpecify the time your window should start processing orders and the time you want to stop processing orders by adding Open Time and Close Time for each Week Day by updating the Location's SLA information.\\nFulfillment SLA Hours and Fulfillment Cutoff Time are not used by your window so these can be left empty.\\nAdd Closed Dates to indicate dates your team is not operational.\\nnoteWe recommend using a virtual location for this.\\nDo not use a physical location for this as these settings are used to measure and monitor the performance of your fulfillment operation.\\nEnvironment Variables​\\n\\n\\nCUSTOMER_SERVICE_MATURITY_PERIOD - Configured in minutes; orders must be at least this old from time of purchase to be eligible for fulfillment.  This maturity period is used in conjunction with the operating hours configured in the location so that your team has ample time to respond to new order purchased during the operation.\\n\\n\\nVIRTUAL_SALES_CHANNEL_LOCATION_ID - This is the ID of the location with the operational hours configured.\\n\\n\\nCUSTOMER_SERVICE_TIMEZONE - Only IANA TZ database names are accepted (i.e. America/New_York or America/Los_Angeles). The timezone is needed to standardize the operating hours defined in the virtual location.\\n\\n\\nCUSTOMER_SERVICE_WINDOW_BYPASS_TAGS - CSV of tags.

They run off of the PUSH_ORDERS Supplier Action and match orders that have been imported into ChannelApe. The Warehouse Location Map let's the play know which warehouses are available for routing. More details can be found on the Play Invocation Supplier API Reference\\nOrder Query Parameters​\\nOrder query parameters filter imported orders and will run the play for each matched order. The following fields are supported:\\n\\nstatuses: A list of statuses for querying orders. These are the fields used in supplier if they exist. This defaults to OPEN if not provided.\\nchannelIds: A list of channels on your business to query orders from\\npurchasedAtMinIntervalMinutes: Lookback interval for the startDate parameter when querying orders . Defaults to 1440 minutes.\\npurchasedAtMaxIntervalMinutes: Lookback interval for the endDate parameter when querying orders . Defaults to 0 minutes.\\nupdatedAtMinIntervalMinutes: Lookback interval for the updatedAtStartDate parameter when querying orders .\\nupdatedAtMaxIntervalMinutes: Lookback interval for the updatedAtEndDate parameter when querying orders .\\n\\nTypical Steps​\\nA Send Orders Play will typically consist of the following steps:\\n\\nCustomer Service Window Step\\nOrder Management Step\\n1 or many Warehouse - Send Order Steps\\nUpdate ChannelApe Step\\n\\nExample​\\nYesNoNew Fulfillment OrdersPending Warehouse A Fulfillment OrdersPending Warehouse A and B Fulfillment OrdersPending Fulfillment OrdersCommitted InventoryMatched OrderCustomer Service WindowSend order for fulfillment?Order ManagementUpdate ChannelApeWarehouse A - Send OrdersWarehouse B - Send OrdersInventory Items\\nThe play once installed on the business as a supplier will match 0 to many orders based on the Order Query Parameters.\\nA matched order will go through the Customer Service Window Step to decide if the order can be sent for fulfillment based on the intelligent maturity period. If the answer is yes then we proceed to Order Management Step.\\nWithin Order Management Step we check inventory levels and DOM Rules to see what is available to fulfill and create NEW fulfillments for everything available to ship. The NEW fulfillments are passed to one or many Warehouse - Send Order Steps (i.e. Webhook Send Orders Step)\\nEach warehouse step will look within the Warehouse Location Map to see what locations it is managing and capable of sending orders for. Any NEW fulfillments with a locationId that the Step can handle will be sent to the warehouse. The status will then be updated from NEW to PENDING and COMMITTED inventory will be increased at the location for every line item on the order fulfillment request.\\nLastly the Update ChannelApe Step will commit all changes to ChannelApe (order updates, inventory updates, order activity creation).PreviousOverviewNextStepsOrder Query ParametersTypical StepsExampleCopyright © 2024 ChannelApe, Inc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":3352,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"QqYYBt515tSdajDQNfBCD0t5wspn32IcZOzrrOz48Sk=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"15fd916d-fae6-458e-9274-7bfec0d2131f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"15fd916d-fae6-458e-9274-7bfec0d2131f\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/playbook-webhook-send-orders-play\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"550a9abb-6dfc-4d6d-b09f-14310d642dd2\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://dev.channelape.com/docs/playbook-webhook-send-orders-play\"},\"hash\":\"bOlDQGvHGnFF/80oXhhwXeSJgszTZ3ZaHzeKpkBGxbU=\"}},\"text\":\"Send Order Fulfillment Requests | ChannelApe Dev Docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main contentChannelApeDocsKnowledge BaseAPI ReferenceGraphQLREST API V2REST API V1SiteIntroductionAPI UsageBusinessesChannelsSuppliersLocationsActionsOrder ActivitiesPlaybookOverviewPlaysStepsWarehouse Location MapWebhooksSend Order Fulfillment RequestsReceive Fulfillment Order ReceiptsOrder Fulfillment Request RejectionsProcess CancellationsInventoryOrdersShipmentsUpsertsWebhooksPlaybookWebhooksSend Order Fulfillment RequestsOn this pageSend Order Fulfillment RequestsPlaybook allows for sending of orders to one or many warehouses for fulfillment via webhook.\\nConfiguration​\\nInstall the Webhook - Send Orders Playbook Play on a business either via the API or the app.\\nSend Orders Play contains most details needed for configuration.
