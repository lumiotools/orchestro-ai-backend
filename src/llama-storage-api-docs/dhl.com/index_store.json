It streamlines the creation, design, production, and delivery of personalized, data driven print mailings. This\nallows a partnersystem user to mix online and offline advertising when addressing their target audience. Print-Mailing Automation is not a marketing\nautomation system. That is, it does not provide the recipients (except for campaigns created to win new prospects), and it does not handle the events,\nfor which an advertising should be created. These are to be handled by the partnersystem.\nPrint-Mailing Automation consists of two separate, logical components - a web service and a **frontend\n** (https://print-mailing.deutschepost.de/planen(link is external)). The web services provides a set of APIs, which allows a partnersystem to manage:\nan advertising campaign, e.g. create a campaign with a specific name for a specific period\nvariables definitions, i.e. define what recipient information will be send and used in the design individualization in the campaign\nrecipient information, as defined in the previous point\nThe frontend enables the fine tuning of an advertising campaign. Through it, single users are able to select the advertising format, the shipping and production methods as well as visually proof the advertising campaign created via the frontend, and check potentials costs. However, the most important function of the frontend is the web editor, which can be used to create the physical design of the mailing, and to define rules, required for the automatic individualization of the advertisement.\nThis guide will help you start creating, designing and sending print mailings to your customers using your own webpage, mobile app, or marketing automation system by leveraging the power of the Print-Mailing Automation API.\nThe primary audience are readers with a technical background, who are interested in\nestimating the complexity of integrating the service\nunderstanding the business and technical requirements and\nintegrating the respective APIs to the service.\nActors\nIn Print-Mailing Automation, we differentiate between three actors:\nPartnersystem: A partnersystem is any system that offers Print-Mailing Automation service to its customers as an advertising channel for direct mail by implementing Print-Mailing Automation's APIs. Partner systems can be all systems that control advertising. These are in particular marketing suites or marketing automation systems. But it can also be mailing systems, shops or CRM systems.\nCustomer: A customer of a partner system, as defined above, operates the partnersystem as the tenant of this system. With the use of Print-Mailing Automation, customers can use the direct mailing advertising channel as an additional advertising channel, whereby they also become the customer of the Print-Mailing Automation web application. A customer has the right to create, change and delete campaigns and variables for their individualization from the partnersystem.\nSystemuser: A systemuser is a specific person who is an employee of a company that uses a partnersystem as a customer. The systemuser has the right to log in to the Print-Mailing Automation frontend. There he can edit campaigns for his company by selecting ad formats, specifying production and shipping options and designing the ad.\nAudience information\nThe primary audience of this documentation are readers with a technical background, who are interested in\nestimating the complexity of integrating the service\nunderstanding the business and technical requirements and\nintegrating the respective APIs to the service.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":3856,"endCharIdx":8132,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Rl2AIxlZG8mZY+6bStkF1Fbf9SmgL+i6Ii1aeekhl3I="},"348f5647-9e2a-4c0a-987c-bdcef1e99553":{"id_":"348f5647-9e2a-4c0a-987c-bdcef1e99553","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-automation-api"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55610f65-7cae-4208-87ff-495c6a28da86","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-automation-api"},"hash":"pyOEW2Dr7QYaSGj5mazN9mnxtUzLMDtLOS629Ib1zA4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"179fae20-3b78-4b3d-9373-bd0941752cb9","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-automation-api"},"hash":"f7DY6G7YToIbNZ7uFJ0ToIXeADXT/RNsSpgX0khRuT0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2888eae5-7187-4ee1-97d5-3ed103f6380d","metadata":{},"hash":"yf8I5sdCERF2p0toHJzzI+DJ/PCUXaxPatsRg4AI4gE="}},"text":"Get Access\nThe integration of Print-Mailing Automation in your system is a two-step process. The first steps is receiving access to the test environment and starting the integration development and testing. Once the development is finished and tests have been successfully conducted, you will be configured on the production environment and will receive your production credentials.\n\nYou need to have a signed contract with DPAG before the registration process.\n\nHow-To request your tenants test environment:\nPlease fill the Einrichtungsauftrag_Automation*.docx\nThe tenant name you would like to perform your testing with (if not specified, you will be provided one).\nContact person for technical questions/information exchange (the person will be used for generating example access token, as discussed later in the document. First name, last name, and email address suffice.\nIP addresses, from which you will be accessing the test environment (your IP address needs to be whitelisted in our firewall for you to gain access to the test environment).\nTo get your External Customer ID of the Group Developer Portal, you need to Register. After logged-in, the id can be found in the User Profile.\nsend it to it-csp@deutschepost.de(link sends email).\nUse \"[#ma] Configuration of YOUR COMPANY in Print-Mailing Automation Test System\" as e-mail subject header.\nOur staff will contact you directly.\nThe configuration process, including the IP whitelisting, may take up to a week. Once this is done, you will receive the following information per email:\npartnerSystemIdExt: The numeric id of your partnersystem in our system.\npartnerSystemCustomerIdExt: The alphanumeric id identifying your customer, you want to act for.\nauthenticationSecret: A shared secret for authentication.\nOnce you have successfully completed the integration and testing, you are eligible to receive access to the production environment. For this, repeat the registration process above with email header \"[#ma] Configuration of YOUR COMPANY in Print-Mailing Automation Prod System\" and the following information in the body:\nYour tenant name, as per your contract. If such does not exist.\nContact person for generating example token.\nA phone number on which you would like to receive credential information.\nConfiguration process for production environment may take up to one week. Once this is done, you will receive a password-secured zip file per email. The password for the zip file will be provided in a separate email shortly after.\nEnvironments\nWe offer two environments which may differ in their version and documentation\nProduction environment (PROD)\nuse this Documentation\nTest Environment (UAT)\nuse this Documentation for UAT\nserves as a sandbox\nRequests made to the test environment never affect productive systems and are not billed.\nSee the servers drop-down menu in the Reference Docs for the environments URLs.\n\nThere are two different technical specifications for both\n  the production environment (PROD) and test environment (UAT). Updates will be available in UAT first. These updates then also appear with a time lag on PROD. You can see from the release notes of both documentations whether the technical specification for the UAT is more up-to-date than for the PROD.Using the API\nThis API is built conform to the REST architectural style to provide interoperability.Exposed API resources can be manipulated using HTTP methods.Requests to a resource URL generate a response with JSON payload containing detailed information about the requested resource.HTTP response codes are used to indicate API errors.We use a token-based approach to authorize requests coming from your system.Http requests\nApply the standardized HTTP method semantics to communicate with the Print-Mailing Automation API.The API offers clearly identifiable resources (\"things of the Print-Mailing Automation universe\").You can use a resource's representation to create, update, delete and execute resources.There are different types of resources:\nSingle resource: E.g.a systemuser, a campaign and its corresponding properties.A PUT updates properties of an existing single resource identified by an id.List resource: A (pageable) list of single resources e.g.a list of systemusers.Usually, a list resource doesn't include all properties of the single resources.A POST adds a new single resource to a list resource.Processing resource: Triggers a usually long running asynchronous process.This might be a price calculation or a campaign order.A POST is used to trigger processing resources.Lookup resource: Offer permitted (enum) field values for simpler communication with the API.API clients can see which values they can expect and have to include in requests.E.g.values for campaign states (active, paused, …).Usually, lookup resources include an internationalized label.POST requests are used to create single resources on a list resource.The semantic for list endpoints is best described as 'please add the enclosed representation to the list resource identified by the URL'.On a successful POST request, the server will create one or multiple new resources and provide their URLs in the response.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"D3NYNxH7UwuYt27Fi1OD/+dfwr0ztKyidQWgCF4s5+M="},"2888eae5-7187-4ee1-97d5-3ed103f6380d":{"id_":"2888eae5-7187-4ee1-97d5-3ed103f6380d","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-automation-api"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55610f65-7cae-4208-87ff-495c6a28da86","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-automation-api"},"hash":"pyOEW2Dr7QYaSGj5mazN9mnxtUzLMDtLOS629Ib1zA4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"348f5647-9e2a-4c0a-987c-bdcef1e99553","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-automation-api"},"hash":"wi/eGBBhC6HQYO/JP0IjU3Pg3YrQPVIM/mvjHZa5cAo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"bdfc2937-7430-4342-8b61-1628d1305709","metadata":{},"hash":"EWlAhRqlUNB5DuFgI33yI81u+jGBJFsDXlgjPZgw09w="}},"text":"List

'please add the enclosed representation to the list resource identified by the URL'.On a successful POST request, the server will create one or multiple new resources and provide their URLs in the response.Successful POST requests will usually generate 201.PUT requests are used to update an entire resources, which already exists and thus can be clearly identified by an id.The semantic is best described as \"please put the enclosed representation at the resource mentioned by the URL, replacing any existing resource\".On successful PUT requests, the server will replace the entire resource addressed by the URL with the representation passed in the payload (subsequent reads will deliver the same payload).Successful PUT requests will usually generate 200.GET, DELETE and OPTIONS requests follow the standardized HTTP method semantics.Headers\nYou can (and sometimes have to) set HTTP headers.This could be the 'Content-Type', 'Accept', 'Accept-Encoding' or 'Authorization' headers, among others.Please only set headers that are necessary.Caution\nBe aware that HTTP headers with empty values are not allowed for security reasons and such requests will be rejected.Payload and media types\nThe standard media type for requests and responses is application/json with default encoding UTF-8.However, other media types like application/xml are supported, too.See the concrete resource definition for all accepted media types.Tip\nSet the header 'Accept: application/json' in your JSON requests in order to get a detailed JSON response in case of an error.Use the same semantics for null and absent properties.OpenApi 3.x allows to mark properties as required and as nullable to specify whether properties may be absent ({}) or null ({\"example\":null}).If a property is defined to be not required and nullable (see 2nd row in Table below), this rule demands that both cases must be handled in the exact same manner by specification.The following table shows all combinations and whether the examples are valid:\nrequired\nnullable\n{}\n{\"example\":null}\ntrue\ntrue\nNo\nYes\nfalse\ntrue\nYes\nYes\ntrue\nfalse\nNo\nNo\nfalse\nfalse\nYes\nNo\nrequired\nnullable\n{}\n{\"example\":null}\ntrue\ntrue\nNo\nYes\nfalse\ntrue\nYes\nYes\ntrue\nfalse\nNo\nNo\nfalse\nfalse\nYes\nNo\nboolean properties must not be null.A boolean is essentially a closed enumeration of two values, true and false.HTTP response compression\nThe Print-Mailing Automation API will compress all text-based responses using your favorite compression algorithm.Tip\nPlease set a correct Accept-Encoding http header for all your request, if applicable!This increases the API user experience and saves bandwidth.Date and time formats\nUse the date and time formats defined by RFC 3339(link is external):\nFor \"date\" use strings matching yyyy-MM-dd, for example: 2026-05-28\nFor \"date-time\" use strings matching yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z', for example 2026-05-28T14:07:17.000Z\nNote that the OpenApi format \"date-time\" corresponds to \"date-time\" in the RFC and \"date\" corresponds to \"full-date\" in RFC.Both are specific profiles, a subset of the international standard ISO 8601.A zone offset must not be used.Date time values are always interpreted in UTC without offsets.Localization of date time should be done by the api client, if necessary.Status codes and common error structures\nApply the standardized HTTP status code semantics to communicate with the Print-Mailing Automation API.The OpenApi specification of every resource provides information about specific success and error responses.It is not a complete list to avoid an overload with common sense information.See below the list of most commonly used status codes in the Print-Mailing Automation API:\nStatus code\nMeaning\n200 OK\nRequest completed successfully.201 Created\nRequest

resources of the Print-Mailing Automation API support pagination and filtering to reduce the amount of returned data and improve the API client experience.If no resource fits to the given filtering criteria an empty list is returned.An HTTP 404 is never returned form a list resource.Request\nMeaning\n?page=0&size=50\nGet the first page, maximum 50 items per page.?page=0&size=50&company=Dynp\nGet the first page, maximum 50 items per page.Search in field \"company\" with value \"Dynp\".?page=0&size=50&sort=company,asc\nGet the first page, maximum 50 elements per page.Sort ascending by fieldName

resources also include link relation fields for easier pagination:\nself: The hyperlink pointing to the same page.prev: The hyperlink pointing to the previous page.next: The hyperlink pointing to the next page.Lookup resources\nLookup resources offer permitted (enum) field values for simpler communication with the API.There are cases where a API client has to send a specific value from a set of permitted values.If you have a frontend application, these kind of values usually can be picked from a drop down menu.A lookup resource publishes all of this permitted values (which are mostly ids) together with an internationalized label.{\n   \"Font\": [{\n      \"id\": 10,\n      \"label\": \"Arial\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"id\": 11,\n      \"label\": \"Arial Bold\"\n   }, \"....\"]\n}\n\nError code lookup resources\nError code lookup resources offer a complete list of error codes, specific resources may return in an error response.This resource can be helpful during API client development.An error code lookup resource publishes all of this codes with an internationalized label.{\n   \"CommonBusinessError\":[\n      {\n         \"value\":\"DM_CO_0001\",\n

errors.This type of errors is common to all resources.Versioning\nThe API has explicit API versioning within the URL (/v1/).However, we apply the following rules to evolve the Print-Mailing Automation API in a backward-compatible way to stay on v1 as long as possible:\nAdd only optional, never mandatory fields.Never change the semantic of fields (e.g.changing the semantic from customer-ekp to customer-id, as both are different unique customer keys)\nInput fields may have (complex) constraints being validated via server-side business logic.Never change the validation logic to be more restrictive and make sure that all constraints are clearly defined in description.Support redirection in case an URL has to change 301 (Moved Permanently).API clients should apply the following principles:\nBe conservative with API requests and data passed as input, e.g.avoid to exploit definition deficits like passing megabytes of strings with unspecified maximum length.Be tolerant in processing and reading data of API responses.Be tolerant with unknown fields in the payload, i.e. ignore new fields but do not eliminate them from payload if needed for subsequent PUT requests.Remember, the semantics of PUT.Be prepared that enum return parameter may deliver new values; either be agnostic or provide default behavior for unknown values.Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in endpoint definitions.Note also, that status codes are extensible.Default handling is how you would treat the corresponding 2xx code (see RFC 7231 Section 6(link is external)).Follow the redirect when the server returns HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently).Authentication\nMost of the Print-Mailing Automation API resources are secured using OAuth 2.0.The first step accessing the Print-Mailing Automation API is to create an access token JWT (json web token) using the user/authentication resource.Add this access token, which usually starts with 'ey…', to the Authorization http header of every request:\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJJKK78Bhu53KB.......iJKV1QiL\nGET https://api-eu.dhl.com/post/advertising/print-mailing/resource/4711\n\nYou can decode (base64) the Print-Mailing Automation JWT to get further information for communicating with the API.A JWT contains the following payload:\n{\n    \"sub\": \"paul\",\n    \"iss\": \"com.dpdhl.dialogmarketing\",\n    \"fullName\": \"Paul Watson\",\n    \"customerIds\": [ \"4\" ],\n    \"exp\": 1588272706,\n    \"locale\": \"de\",\n    \"iat\": 1588269106,\n    \"userId\": 2,\n    \"authorities\": [ \"ROLE_PMP_ACCESS\", \"ROLE_DIS_ACCESS\", \"ROLE_DIS_MANAGE_DIALOGPOST\" ]\n}\n\nThe most important fields are:\ncustomerIds: Usually the Ids of the customer(s) you have access to.In the most cases, this will be exactly one.You need this id for subsequent requests.Depending on the API you access, this might be you employer.In this case, you have access to several other customers and you are offered a resource which returns the list of accessible customer Ids.exp: Expiry datetime of the token in UTC (jwt standard field).locale: Your chosen local for internationalization.userId: This is your systemuser id.authorities: An array containing all your access rights.Every access token has a specific valid time (about 30 minutes).An expired access token can never be used again and lets the Print-Mailing Automation refuse the whole request.You have to call the user/authentication/reauth resource with a valid token to get a fresh access token with the maximum valid time.We recommend to get a new access token a couple of minutes before the expiration time.Warning\nHandle your access token like a password!Depending on your systemuser account, you have a specific number of authorities (\"access rights\").The OpenApi specification of every resource provides information about the authorities you have to own to access a resource.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"JLhoe4DiLDf08gnSG+U/ZWnn/LFY/KoXaWESCXB9hIQ="},"898133f2-e100-4923-af5e-8076909fd3cd":{"id_":"898133f2-e100-4923-af5e-8076909fd3cd","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-automation-api"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"55610f65-7cae-4208-87ff-495c6a28da86","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-automation-api"},"hash":"pyOEW2Dr7QYaSGj5mazN9mnxtUzLMDtLOS629Ib1zA4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"544ae1cd-2f15-45e9-abc8-a17061e4a855","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-automation-api"},"hash":"naoB3yRpBBz/SGrE4vaz1TJp2uJYL2wJkKJH/5bt12g="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"dadbf8ba-4e42-47d0-b751-f436d329c324","metadata":{},"hash":"5xlqegM9xb3Auoa0TzGFO2Z6cE+Yvpa3i5qZXaPFkqI="}},"text":"In

numeric id of your partnersystem in our system.partnerSystemCustomerIdExt (equals \"masClientId\"): The alphanumeric id identifying your customer, you want to act for.ssoTokenKey: A shared secret used for signing the JWT you generated.You transfer the relevant data for the systemuser login in a JWT (RFC 7519(link is external)) to us.Use a short validity (about 2 minutes) and sign the token with the shared sso token key.Print-Mailing Automation API will validate the JWT and find or create the systemuser.The JWT you generate, must have the following structure:\n{\n    \"firstname\": \"Connie\",\n    \"lastname\": \"Baker\",\n    \"email\": \"connie.baker@dynp.com\",\n    \"username\": \"connie_baker\",\n    \"masClientId\": \"DynpCompany\",\n    \"masId\": 1000,\n    \"iss\": \"issuer\",\n    \"exp\": 1589269431,\n    \"iat\": 1589267631\n}\n\nThe most important fields are:\nfirstname: The systemuser's firstname (max.50 characters).lastname: The systemuser's lastname (max.50 characters).email: The systemuser's email address (max.150 characters).username: The systemuser's username (max.80 characters).Must be unique for the same partnersystem customer.exp: Expiry datetime

definitions and sending your first recipients.\nA campaign (likewise \"longtermcampaign\" or \"print mailing\") comprises all relevant information for a specific print mailing.Print mailings are rendered, printed and sent to your customers.\nA mailing comprises all relevant information needed for the graphical design of a print mailing. Based on a mailing template and probably enriched with variable definitions you design a personal mail experience for every customer.\nAfter activating the campaign, you supply us with concrete recipient data.Recipients contain delivery address and customization data for each print mailing (e.g. special offers per customer, salutation or date of birth).Recipients are accepted throughout the whole day, however they get rendered only once a day.\n\nImportant\nA campaign and all dependent information can only be changed as long as the campaign is not active. Creating and updating campaigns and variable definitions as well as sending recipients is a common task of an api user with the role partnersystem whereas uploading and design the mailing template, placing variable definitions on the mailing template and defining the variable definition's type usually is accomplished by partnersystem editors. A partnersystem editor typically uses our frontend(link is external) to accomplish these tasks.

It is recommended to save this id in your system for easy access.\nsenderAddress: You might want to add a sender address printed on your print mailings afterwards.\nCreate variable definitions\nYou can and should define the variable data printed on every print mailing. This is where variable definitions come into place. There are two types of variable definitions:\nAddress variable definitions: The recipient's postal address.To ensure the correct delivery, we have concrete validation rules for the variable values and do an address variable mapping.This means that we map a variable definition to a field in a postal address (e.g. street, house number, zip, …).The Print-Mailing Automation backend implements an algorithm to help you with this and keeps a list of synonyms which probably match your variable definition labels so that automatic mapping takes place.However, a partnersystem editor has to confirm the mapping before activating the campaign.A partnersystem editor can overrule our guess and set a specific addressVariableId which he can retrieve from the addressvariables resource.This resource also includes the current list of synonyms.\nIndividual variable definitions: Anything else you want to print on a print mailing including various data types.Depending on the campaign's individualization type (which a partnersystem editor can choose), the number of variable definitions might be limited.\nSpecial address line optimizations take place if you choose to address a company.You can choose between a maximum of three address lines for the company's name.Because of address formatting requirements, ma API will convert your recipient data according to the following rules:\ncompanyname2 and companyname3 are shifted left, if companyname1 or companyname2 are empty.\nIf companyname_X contains line breaks (Hex 0A or 0D), the contents are divided and distributed to the other address variables.\nEvery address variable content will be truncated to a maximum number of 40 characters.\nCompany address line optimization examples\nInput: companyname_1\nInput: companyname_2\nInput: companyname_3\n\nResult: companyname_1\nResult: companyname_2\nResult: companyname_3\nTodd’s Custom Meats\nTodd Carver\nand Becky Carver\n\nTodd’s Custom Meats\nTodd Carver\nand Becky Carver\n\nTodd’s Custom Meats\n\n\nTodd’s Custom Meats\n\n\n\nNandwani’s Tailors\nReginald Milton\n\nNandwani’s Tailors\nReginald Milton\n\nWASHCOLAUNDRY LLC.

rules above if you place company address variables onto a mailing template during the design phase.Facts about variable definitions\nVariable definition's label must be unique within one mailing.Variable definitions are visualized in the ma frontend ordered by sortOrder value.A variable definition always has a dataType (string, date, zip, …).There always has to be exactly one variable definition of type \"zip\".Only variable definitions of data type \"string\" can become address variable definitions.A variable definition becomes an address variable if an addressVariableId is defined.A partner system editor confirmed the address variable mapping if the value addressVariableMappingConfirmed is true.A variable definition has a selected flag.This controls the variable definition's visibility for different campaign individualization types.An individual variable definition can have an overprint style which positions the variable definition on a mailing template.Role ROLEPMPLONGTERMCAMPAIGNPARTNERSYSTEM can never set overprint style information, address variables and selected flags.You can (and must) ignore these properties.They are set when designing the mailing template.Tip\nMake sure to have understood the rules above before sending recipients to minimize effort for updating your variable definitions.Use the addressvariables resource to get information about required address variables and synonyms.Data types and allowed values\nID\nData Type\nFormat\n10\nSTRING\nFree text to the maximum length of 255 characters.The backslash and control characters

With the Print-Mailing Dispatch Preparation API, you calculate the prices, including postage and production optimization, frank your items using IT franking and generate all accompanying documents required for shipping, such as the posting list.\nWith the Print-Mailing API for Dispatch Preparation, you can use your software to simply and automatically prepare your print mailing for shipping:\nCalculate prices by entering address data and production parameters\nOptimize postage by entering production parameters such as the shipment format. Current requirements of Deutsche Post are automatically taken into account\nThe dispatch preparation supports franking types such as the franking wave or franking impression. IT franking is an integral element.\nYou can create, change or cancel orders using the order management system.\nCreate accompanying documentation such as the posting list and bundle, tray and pallet labels. Digital integration into customer processes.\nPost items yourself or organize their pickup automatically.\nThe benefits for you\nPrepare the dispatch of your print mailing with one software for all Deutsche Post dialogue marketing products\nFull integration into your system landscape and process flows\nNo license fees\nNew functions, data and prices without time-consuming software updates\nCompliant with GDPR and Postal Act\nData processing in Germany and the EU (private cloud of Deutsche Post DHL) For more information, see https://www.deutschepost.de/de/p/print-mailing/partner.html.\n\nThe web services covers the following postal products of DPAG:\nDIALOGPOST(link is external)\nPOSTWURFSPEZIAL(link is external)\nPOSTAKTUELL(link is external).\nThe Dispatch Preparation API perfectly harmonises with the Targeting API from Deutsche Post, which will support you to select regions or postal codes resulting in the required input for the POSTAKTUELL or POSTWURFSPEZIAL pricecalcualtion.\nFind more information about the Targeting API here.\n\nAdditional services\nWith IT franking, you organize your mail and merchandise shipments in a simple, cost-effective and efficient way via your own IT systems. It is not possible to transfer existing IT contracts. As is the case for other applications, a new IT contract must be additionally created and/or agreed for the Print-Mailing API for Dispatch Preparation. Here you will find all the necessary information and access requirements.\nThe intelligent process for your digital address maintenance: Click here to learn all about our Premiumadress product.\nWhen you post Postwurfspezial items for the first time, you must conclude a permanent contract on the use of Postwurfspezial partial addresses with Deutsche Post before the partial addresses are given to you. Please contact your customer advisor about this.\nThe API transmits the result of your optimization directly to the Deutsche Post electronic order management system (OMS). Not only can you create new orders, you can also change or cancel existing orders. When using the API, you do not require separate access data for data exchange with the OMS.\nAudience information\nThe primary audience of this documentation are readers with a technical background, who are interested in\nestimating the complexity of integrating the service\nunderstanding the business and technical requirements and\nintegrating the respective APIs to the service.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":6356,"endCharIdx":10236,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vtdUrnEa/NsDFcIXLz4MyTUfGPHwxDZDv5RlhNThKsE="},"9c17c4ae-e361-47f9-a619-bfc3ee23cabd":{"id_":"9c17c4ae-e361-47f9-a619-bfc3ee23cabd","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"edac8fd7-e374-431f-bdc9-6a353711d756","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"hash":"brTQW63nJET38zf0oovJNlwalBtfFH9VwCE19uFIVOI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d73c67f0-625f-418d-aa58-241e00224ac8","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"hash":"v11h8TQVhXR3CAZVQQnoHVftF3pjEnnGuoCOJG5QJpY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a019c8c0-5b24-4904-87c2-f0fb885f51e4","metadata":{},"hash":"MM0pg0kL+vQro5ljrld9atMmshuI7shKMdhdf5m6ubA="}},"text":"Get Access\nThe API functions for price calculation of the COST CALCULATION API resources are freely available to you, without having credentials:\nSimple/Standard cost calculation for DIALOGPOST\nStandard cost calculation for POSTWURFSPEZIAL\nStandard cost calculation for POSTAKTUELL\nIn order to process and book orders and receive shipment documents with the PROCESSING API resources, you need to have an own user environment and credentials.\nPlease fill the Einrichtungsauftrag_Dispatchprepation*.docx and\nsend it to it-csp@deutschepost.de(link sends email).\nUse \"[#dis] your company name\" as e-mail subject header.\nOur staff will contact you directly.\nInitially, only the access data for the test environment will be created.

Updates will be available in UAT first. These updates then also appear with a time lag on PROD. You can see from the release notes of both documentations whether the technical specification for the UAT is more up-to-date than for the PROD.Using the API\nThis API is built conform to the REST architectural style to provide interoperability.Exposed API resources can be manipulated using HTTP methods.Requests to a resource URL generate a response with JSON payload containing detailed information about the requested resource.HTTP response codes are used to indicate API errors.We use a token-based approach to authorize requests coming from your system.Http requests\nApply the standardized HTTP method semantics to communicate with the Print-Mailing Automation API.The API offers clearly identifiable resources (\"things of the Print-Mailing Automation universe\").You can use a resource's representation to create, update, delete and execute resources.There are different types of resources:\nSingle resource: E.g.a systemuser, a campaign and its corresponding properties.A PUT updates properties of an existing single resource identified by an id.List resource: A (pageable) list of single resources e.g.a list of systemusers.Usually, a list resource doesn't include all properties of the single resources.A POST adds a new single resource to a list resource.Processing resource: Triggers a usually long running asynchronous process.This might be a price calculation or a campaign order.A POST is used to trigger processing resources.Lookup resource: Offer permitted (enum) field values for simpler communication with the API.API clients can see which values they can expect and have to include in requests.E.g.values for campaign states (active, paused, …).Usually, lookup resources include an internationalized label.POST requests are used to create single resources on a list resource.The semantic for list endpoints is best described as 'please add the enclosed representation to the list resource identified by the URL'.On a successful POST request, the server will create one or multiple new resources and provide their URLs in the response.Successful POST requests will usually generate 201.PUT requests are used to update an entire resources, which already exists and thus can be clearly identified by an id.The semantic is best described as \"please put the enclosed representation at the resource mentioned by the URL, replacing any existing resource\".On successful PUT requests, the server will replace the entire resource addressed by the URL with the representation passed in the payload (subsequent reads will deliver the same payload).Successful PUT requests will usually generate 200.GET, DELETE and OPTIONS requests follow the standardized HTTP method semantics.Headers\nYou can (and sometimes have to) set HTTP headers.This could be the 'Content-Type', 'Accept', 'Accept-Encoding' or 'Authorization' headers, among others.Please only set headers that are necessary.Caution\nBe aware that HTTP headers with empty values are not allowed for security reasons and such requests will be rejected.Payload and media types\nThe standard media type for requests and responses is application/json with default encoding UTF-8.However, other media types like application/xml are supported, too.See the concrete resource definition for all accepted media types.Tip\nSet the header 'Accept: application/json' in your JSON requests in order to get a detailed JSON response in case of an error.Use the same semantics for null and absent properties.OpenApi

detailed JSON response in case of an error.Use the same semantics for null and absent properties.OpenApi 3.x allows to mark properties as required and as nullable to specify whether properties may be absent ({}) or null ({\"example\":null}).If a property is defined to be not required and nullable (see 2nd row in Table below), this rule demands that both cases must be handled in the exact same manner by specification.The following table shows all combinations and whether the examples are valid:\nrequired\nnullable\n{}\n{\"example\":null}\ntrue\ntrue\nNo\nYes\nfalse\ntrue\nYes\nYes\ntrue\nfalse\nNo\nNo\nfalse\nfalse\nYes\nNo\nrequired\nnullable\n{}\n{\"example\":null}\ntrue\ntrue\nNo\nYes\nfalse\ntrue\nYes\nYes\ntrue\nfalse\nNo\nNo\nfalse\nfalse\nYes\nNo\nboolean properties must not be null.A boolean is essentially a closed enumeration of two values, true and false.HTTP response compression\nThe Print-Mailing Automation API will compress all text-based responses using your favorite compression algorithm.Tip\nPlease set a correct Accept-Encoding http header for all your request, if applicable!This increases the API user experience and saves bandwidth.Date and time formats\nUse the date and time formats defined by RFC 3339(link is external):\nFor \"date\" use strings matching yyyy-MM-dd, for example: 2026-05-28\nFor \"date-time\" use strings matching yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z', for example 2026-05-28T14:07:17.000Z\nNote that the OpenApi format \"date-time\" corresponds to \"date-time\" in the RFC and \"date\" corresponds to \"full-date\" in RFC.Both are specific profiles, a subset of the international standard ISO 8601.A zone offset must not be used.Date time values are always interpreted in UTC without offsets.Localization of date time should be done by the api client, if necessary.Status codes and common error structures\nApply the standardized HTTP status code semantics to communicate with the Print-Mailing Automation API.The OpenApi specification of every resource provides information about specific success and error responses.It is not a complete list to avoid an overload with common sense information.See below the list of most commonly used status codes in the Print-Mailing Automation API:\nStatus code\nMeaning\n200 OK\nRequest completed successfully.201 Created\nRequest completed successfully.Resource created.400 Bad Request\nInvalid/not parseable JSON payload.Non existing enum value recognized.Concurrent update of a resource.401 Unauthorized\nMissing access token in

your application handle these specific error cases and don't only look for http status codes!If you want to get in contact with us because of an error response, please also supply the correlationId.This is a unique id which is generated for every request and can help us to trace requests through our backend.Common representation structures\nMost of the resource representations include common fields:\n{\n   \"id\":87075,\n   \"createdOn\":\"2020-04-02T11:48:51.000Z\",\n   \"changedOn\":\"2020-04-29T13:02:56.000Z\",\n   \"version\":44,\n   \".....\": \".....\"}\n\nUse this id to address the resource.The version is a simple counter informing about resource changes.A paged list resource has the following structure:\n{\n   \"elements\":[\n      {\n         \"id\":549,\n         \"createdOn\":\"2020-03-04T09:05:11.000Z\",\n         \"changedOn\":null,\n         \"version\":1,\n         \".....\": \".....\"},\n      { ...}\n   ],\n   \"page\":{\n      \"size\":50,\n

paging, if you expect bigger result sets.List resources also include link relation fields for easier pagination:\nself: The hyperlink pointing to the same page.prev: The hyperlink pointing to the previous page.next: The hyperlink pointing to the next page.Lookup resources\nLookup resources offer permitted (enum) field values for simpler communication with the API.There are cases where a API client has to send a specific value from a set of permitted values.If you have a frontend application, these kind of values usually can be picked from a drop down menu.A lookup resource publishes all of this permitted values (which are mostly ids) together with an internationalized label.{\n   \"Font\": [{\n      \"id\": 10,\n      \"label\": \"Arial\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"id\": 11,\n      \"label\": \"Arial Bold\"\n   }, \"....\"]\n}\n\nError code lookup resources\nError code lookup resources offer a complete list of error codes, specific resources may return in an error response.This resource can be helpful during API client development.An error code lookup resource publishes all of this codes with an internationalized label.{\n   \"CommonBusinessError\":[\n      {\n         \"value\":\"DM_CO_0001\",\n         \"label\":\"Auswahlwert existiert nicht.\"}, \"...\"],\n   \"RecipientBusinessError\":[\n      {\n         \"value\":\"DM_RC_0001\",\n         \"label\":\"Die Adressfelder des Print-Mailings sind nicht definiert.\"},\n      {\n         \"value\":\"DM_RC_0002\",\n         \"label\":\"Das Print-Mailing existiert nicht.\"}, \"...\"]\n}\n\nError code lookup resources may include common business errors.This type of errors is common to all resources.Versioning\nThe API has explicit API versioning within the URL (/v1/).However, we apply the following rules to evolve the Print-Mailing Automation API in a backward-compatible way to stay on v1 as long as possible:\nAdd only optional, never mandatory fields.Never change the semantic of fields (e.g.changing the semantic from customer-ekp to customer-id, as both are different unique customer keys)\nInput fields may have (complex) constraints being validated via server-side business logic.Never change the validation logic to be more restrictive and make sure that all constraints are clearly defined in description.Support redirection in case an URL has to change 301 (Moved Permanently).API clients should apply the following principles:\nBe conservative with API requests and data passed as input, e.g.avoid to exploit definition deficits like passing megabytes of strings with unspecified maximum length.Be tolerant in processing and reading data of API responses.Be tolerant with unknown fields in the payload, i.e. ignore new fields but do not eliminate them from payload if needed for subsequent PUT requests.Remember, the semantics of PUT.Be prepared that enum return parameter may deliver new values; either be agnostic or provide default behavior for unknown values.Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in endpoint definitions.Note also, that status codes are extensible.Default handling is how you would treat the corresponding 2xx code (see RFC 7231 Section 6(link is external)).Follow the redirect when the server returns HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Bz7o8zGKpkRNx1Ff1T9ibSInH4xz/Yfk+rqPuyRegco="},"562aedd6-28c5-4dfa-9780-64d497e100ea":{"id_":"562aedd6-28c5-4dfa-9780-64d497e100ea","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"edac8fd7-e374-431f-bdc9-6a353711d756","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"hash":"brTQW63nJET38zf0oovJNlwalBtfFH9VwCE19uFIVOI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"712b3f65-5a65-4c64-9619-8d9c9775cb98","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"hash":"Erqhn5iRzKap7Lg8KavfxG8BUys84O3GZYK+jqlx7+Y="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1777210d-da6a-4e05-b93c-b1b52c65531f","metadata":{},"hash":"nSZuU3WHswra2JfNlbLMrt+hKzsU+tvwDzp7/vbEy+s="}},"text":"Support

\nAuthentication\nMost of the Print-Mailing Automation API resources are secured using OAuth 2.0.\nThe first step accessing the Print-Mailing Automation API is to create an access token JWT (json web token) using the user/authentication resource.\nAdd this access token, which usually starts with 'ey…', to the Authorization http header of every request:\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJJKK78Bhu53KB.......iJKV1QiL\nGET https://print-mailing-api.deutschepost.de/resource/4711\n\nYou can decode (base64) the Print-Mailing Automation JWT to get further information for communicating with the API. A JWT contains the following payload:\n{\n    \"sub\": \"paul\",\n    \"iss\": \"com.dpdhl.dialogmarketing\",\n    \"fullName\": \"Paul Watson\",\n    \"customerIds\": [ \"4\" ],\n    \"exp\": 1588272706,\n    \"locale\": \"de\",\n    \"iat\": 1588269106,\n    \"userId\": 2,\n    \"authorities\": [ \"ROLE_PMP_ACCESS\", \"ROLE_DIS_ACCESS\", \"ROLE_DIS_MANAGE_DIALOGPOST\" ]\n}\n\nThe most important fields are:\ncustomerIds: Usually the Ids of the customer(s) you have access to. In the most cases, this will be exactly one. You need this id for subsequent requests. Depending on the API you access, this might be you employer. In this case, you have access to several other customers and you are offered a resource which returns the list of accessible customer Ids.\nexp: Expiry datetime of the token in UTC (jwt standard field).\nlocale: Your chosen local for internationalization.\nuserId: This is your systemuser id.\nauthorities: An array containing all your access rights.\nEvery access token has a specific valid time (about 30 minutes). An expired access token can never be used again and lets the Print-Mailing Automation refuse the whole request. You have to call the user/authentication/reauth resource with a valid token to get a fresh access token with the maximum valid time. We recommend to get a new access token a couple of minutes before the expiration time.\n\nWarning\nHandle your access token like a password!\n\nDepending on your systemuser account, you have a specific number of authorities (\"access rights\"). The OpenApi specification of every resource provides information about the authorities you have to own to access a resource.\nCreating access tokens\nAs an API systemuser you received the following login data from us:\nusername: Your unique username.\npassword: A secret for authentication.\nUse the /user/authentication/businesslogin resource to create an access token, issued with user account details and granted rights. Your token will include the authority 'ROLEDISACCESS' for accessing the dispatch preparation api. Others, like the authority 'ROLEDISMANAGE_DIALOGPOST', are granting rights to access specific api resources.\nAccess rights are assigned to your user account with your initial request for account creation. If you need more access rights, please ask the IT-CSP support to update your user account accordingly.\nExample request and response for a partnersystem login:\nPOST

Reference Docs for a detailed description of the representation structure.\n\n\n \nPROCESSING API\n\"Processing\" your mailing means that the Dispatchpreparation API takes all the necessary input data (shipment type, franking type, quantity, measures, …​) and prepares the necessary documents for posting and preparation.\n\nNote\nFor mailing processing you need a tenant context within the Dispatchpreparation system which is identified by a customer Id. This tenant context comprises all of your specific processing and master data. Please contact us at it-csp@deutschepost.de(link sends email) with a mail subject \"[#dis] API access\" to get your personal authentication data.\n\nPrior to processing, you may add the following master data:\nDV Contracts: If you use DV-Freimachung as your frankingtype for Dialogpost you have to define all relevant contract information you negotiated with your DV franking consultant. For more information about DV-Freimachung please refer to here(link is external).\nAddresses: You have to define all involved parties mentioned e.g. in contracts, Deutsche Post Ordermanagement (AM) Registration or processings.\nProduction definitions: There is a set of standard production definitions. However, you may add additional production definitions if you have specific requirements regarding the production.PROCESSING API - Common\nMaster data\nMaster data is used within your processings.You may add, update or delete you master data as needed.The next chapters explain each master data resource.Addresses\nYou need a valid access token including the access right ROLEDISACCESS to continue (see this section).For several API functions it is necessary to define addresses of involved parties.You have to define all involved parties mentioned e.g.in AM Registration or processings.A party is identified by an EKP number (Unique Customer ID of Deutsche Post), has a postal address and a business contact.Originator EKP: The company who is the sender of the mailing.Submitter EKP: The company responsible for handing over the mailing at the induction date to Deutsche Post.Note\nAll EKPs used in a processing must be defined as address master data prior to processing execution.Example request

Dialogpost the next step is to add a list of your concrete mailing items.We strongly recommend to upload mailing items using gzip encoding as it is much faster and allocates less resources.Large quantities are supported for compressed data, only.Example request to add a list of mailing items (using gzip encoding):\nPOST

order in AM (Deutsche Post Auftragsmanagement).See order records resource.dataMatrixType: Set this to 0 if you do not want Data Matrix Codes to be created.zipCodeCheck: If set to true, German postal codes will be checked.productionInfoText: You can identify production documents with the value of this parameter.accountingInfoText: You can identify the accounting document with the value of this parameter.createDocumentTypes: Control, which resulting documents should be created.See lookup resource DpDocumentType for available values.Variants\nIf you want to produce production variants you should define one production definition per variant and set this production definitions as a parameter in every mailing item.The production definition defined in the mailing will be the default production definition for all mailing items without a concrete definition.An example you can find here example for variants\nOverriding contract settings\nWhile adding information about your mailing to your processing you have to set the reference to a specific contract by setting the values for \"ownerEkp\", \"procedureNumber\" and \"subscriptionNumber\".Doing this the information stored in the contract apply for the processing as well.However you can overwrite some of the values when setting the information about your mailing.That means the values will be different from your contract and

The data will be transferred to order management during order creation.\n\n\n \nFAQ\nHow do I receive my access data for the Print-Mailing API for Dispatch Preparation?\nSee Requesting access data for dispatch preparation.\nWhere do I get the technical specification?\nYou will find the technical specification for the Print-Mailing API for Dispatch Preparation in English at our developer portal.\nWhom do I contact if I have any further technical questions?\nYou can reach us at it-csp@deutschepost.de.\nAre addresses also transmitted to the Print-Mailing API when optimizing Dialogpost?\nNo, a continuous ID is allocated to the addresses, and only the IDs with the associated postal codes are transmitted to the service. The IDs and postal codes are restored following optimization. The addresses can then be attributed again by the ID.\nIs it possible to transfer contracts for IT franking from other applications?\nIt is not possible to transfer existing IT contracts. As is the case for other applications, a new IT contract must be additionally created and/or agreed for the Print-Mailing API for Dispatch Preparation.\nCan address data be transmitted in different formats?\nNo. The transmission of data through the Print-Mailing API for Dispatch Preparation must take place via an API request in json format.\nCan order changes or cancellations be directly updated through an API entry in the OM (order management) system?\nYes. Through the Print-Mailing API for Dispatch Preparation, orders can be automatically created, changed or canceled.\nWhat personal data are transferred to the print mailing services for target group planning and dispatch preparation (API and online service)?\nFor the posting of your mailings at one of our acceptance points, we require information on the sender, poster and, if applicable, deviating payer. Transferred are not just company data, but also the personal data of contact persons from a company. Specifically, this refers to the first and last names, e-mail address, phone number, fax number and the company name.\nAre the complete recipient addresses transferred for a print mailing?\nRecipient addresses and thus personal data are not transferred for the dispatch preparation of addressed mailings (Dialogpost); however, all recipient postal codes are transferred in order to create an optimized delivery sequence.\nFor what purpose and on what legal basis are the data processed?\nThe data are used solely for the fulfillment of the contract concluded with you. The legal basis is therefore Art. 6(1), letter b, of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nHow are the data transmitted to our servers?\nAll communication with the print mailing services takes place with SSL encryption.\nHow long are the data retained?\nInformation pertaining to addresses and metadata (description, most recent processing status, number of shipments) is deleted 30 days after the last amendment of your data. System user data (e.g. first and last name, e-mail address, phone number) required to generate access data for the respective print mailing service are retained for the duration of the contractual relationship. These data are only deleted if the system user requests the deletion of their user account prior to the expiration of the contract.\nAre data passed on to third parties?\nNo. No data are passed on to third parties. No data are transferred to third countries (countries outside the EEA).\nWhat rights apply with regard to data processing?\nThose impacted generally have the right to notification and to correction, deletion, restriction of processing, objection and data portability.\nWho is responsible for data processing?\nDeutsche Post AG, Charles-de-Gaulle Str. 20, 53113 Bonn, Germany\nWhom can I contact if I have any questions about data protection?\na) Data Protection Officer of Deutsche Post AG: Gabriela Krader, 53250 Bonn, Germany datenschutz@dpdhl.com\nb) Competent supervisory authority: The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Postfach 1468, 53004 Bonn, Germany","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":98525,"endCharIdx":102947,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ujHl7jasfpDKxrtXiYsZz17/EgAcOlKZen1cSbK52H8="},"95ade161-7022-4292-8d8d-df9726e7c7d6":{"id_":"95ade161-7022-4292-8d8d-df9726e7c7d6","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"edac8fd7-e374-431f-bdc9-6a353711d756","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"hash":"brTQW63nJET38zf0oovJNlwalBtfFH9VwCE19uFIVOI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8e0daf99-a804-47d9-a5df-36d9ef27cbf4","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"hash":"q0Rz6IdGnb4jWYTmju2DwizY5W/f+SazUqjv8UhYvF0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"47beafdf-f41c-4d12-a071-6d4795f7c032","metadata":{},"hash":"vg8fjQbRBR1ozKNyE/h8BjJcp+9xG8kuAETmM75dPkQ="}},"text":"Support\nOur extensive documentation and developer starter kits (Postman collections), as well as our connection and support team, are available to optimally assist you while you develop the API.\nAt the beginning of the process, we individually advise you on technical and process-related issues associated with the integration of our API into your business processes.

There is a collection with sample requests for each product (Dialogpost, Postwurfspezial, Postaktuell) and a single environment file. The collections are suited for quickly testing the API and its main functions.\nBefore you import the collections in Postman and try out the API requests, please send our Support Team an API credentials request. API credentials (access data) are required to test the API. In our Postman collection user guide, you will learn how to install Postman, import the collections and begin testing the API.\nThe Postman collections are available here in the Download Area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Docs\n\n\n\nDownloadsBy downloading any file, you accept our Terms of UseOpen API Specification File YAML\n \nEinrichtungsauftrag_Dispatchpreparation_2022_12_1.docx\n      DOCX - VND.OPENXMLFORMATS-OFFICEDOCUMENT.WORDPROCESSINGML.DOCUMENT\n    - 19.28 KB\n\n\n \nPostman-Collection-User-Guide-EN_0.pdf\n      PDF - PDF\n    - 544.1 KB\n\n\n \nVersandvorbereitung API - DialogPost.postman_collection_0.json\n      JSON - OCTET-STREAM\n    - 419.5 KB\n\n\n \nVersandvorbereitung API - Postaktuell.postman_collection_0.json\n      JSON - OCTET-STREAM\n    - 28.06 KB\n\n\n \nVersandvorbereitung API - Postwurfspezial.postman_collection_0.json\n      JSON - OCTET-STREAM\n    - 27.17 KB\n\n\n \nNew UAT Versandvorbereitung API.postman_environment_0.json\n      JSON - OCTET-STREAM\n    - 2.2 KB\n\n\n \nGSA-Sortierung_01_2024_0.pdf\n      PDF - PDF\n    - 115.81 KB","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":113520,"endCharIdx":118174,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nuY60xK+TrKk94J07UajO2sNEnsHvh/k80r+PPi5bBc="},"0f162805-aee4-4528-a8e4-c7c1807ae510":{"id_":"0f162805-aee4-4528-a8e4-c7c1807ae510","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"edac8fd7-e374-431f-bdc9-6a353711d756","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"hash":"brTQW63nJET38zf0oovJNlwalBtfFH9VwCE19uFIVOI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e7387279-d494-4c72-b400-291863f5ce58","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api"},"hash":"VNuw/rGY8kW4RUCmiK0rnlyzCcN2JLsHAs9ED/Yrzt8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7d53bc41-5d1c-4605-93d7-8ff8fbabb35f","metadata":{},"hash":"ra4bX2cR/KKosZVzvNoCUDGTlomx168bG+XeAzAL/sc="}},"text":"Postman-Collection-User-Guide-EN_0.pdf\n      PDF - PDF\n    - 544.1 KB\n\n\n \nVersandvorbereitung API - DialogPost.postman_collection_0.json\n      JSON - OCTET-STREAM\n    - 419.5 KB\n\n\n \nVersandvorbereitung API - Postaktuell.postman_collection_0.json\n      JSON - OCTET-STREAM\n    - 28.06 KB\n\n\n \nVersandvorbereitung API - Postwurfspezial.postman_collection_0.json\n      JSON - OCTET-STREAM\n    - 27.17 KB\n\n\n \nNew UAT Versandvorbereitung API.postman_environment_0.json\n      JSON - OCTET-STREAM\n    - 2.2 KB\n\n\n \nGSA-Sortierung_01_2024_0.pdf\n      PDF - PDF\n    - 115.81 KB\n\n\n \nGSA-Sequenzen BZ bundesweit 2024-09-05_0.csv\n      CSV - TEXT/CSV\n    - 43.93 KB\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes\n \n2024-08-15 POSTAKTUELL - Change in bundle production according to delivery districts\n15.Aug.2024\nWith bundle production by delivery district, at least two bundles are now always produced per delivery district.

If you have an active account with DHL eCommerce UK please contact your Sales person or Account Manager.\n\tIf you do not have an account please use this web formhttps://www.dhl.com/gb-en/home/our-divisions/parcel/business-users/business-services/sales-enquiry.html\nThe DHL API team are unable to accept direct requests and will contact you directly once your case has been registered\nAt this stage access to the sandbox API's will be provided - you can try and make requests directly from the reference docs section. Read the detailed documentation on how to use APIs.\nUsing the API\nTo get access to the API, you will receive a Client ID and a Client Password; please use the contact form to apply for these.            \nThe API provides OAuth 2.0 Access Token with various authorization scopes. \nThe “Token” API call provides an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token with authorization scope, assigned to your client id. It grants you an access to use the APIs.\nIt is advisable to first use the Reference Data APIs to obtain valid product and shipping combinations. Invalid parcel combinations will not be allowed and will result in an error response. For example it will not be allowed to create an international shipment with a UK domestic service.\nA sound understanding of the Reference Data APIs will accelerate onboarding.\nEnvironments\nThe addressable API base URL/URI environments are:  \nEnvironment\nDescription\nhttps://api-uat.dhl.com\nUAT environment\nhttps://api.dhl.com\nProduction environment\nEnvironment\nDescription\nhttps://api-uat.dhl.com\nUAT environment\nhttps://api.dhl.com\nProduction environment\nThe UAT environment can be used for testing and development freely. Only the production environment will trigger underlying processes such as billing and operational procedures.\n \nRate Limits\nRate limits protect the DHL infrastructure from suspicious requests that exceed defined thresholds.\nShould you exceed your rate limit you will receive a HTTP status code within the API response that will indicate this. \nIn addition to the rate limit a so called “spike arrest” protects our API Platform from potential outages caused by a very large volume of requests sent in a short time span (minutes or seconds). This will be indicated by a different HTTP status code.\n \nShipping Label API\nThis API offers various functionalities that all support you in managing your parcel shipments. You will find a detailed description on how to use these along with snippets in the reference section \nLabels\nThis API can generate labels as a base64 encoded string\nLabels are available for all covered products, i.e. DHL Parcel Connect, DHL Parcel Return Connect and DHL Parcel International, to understand how this works please visit the reference section \nCurrently the following formats and resolutions are available:\n \nPDF\nZPL 203 dpi\n\t\t\t(10 x 15cm)\nPNG 203 dpi\n\t\t\t(10 x 15cm)\nConnect\nP\nP\nP\nReturn\n\t\t\tConnect\nP\nP\nP\nParcel International\nP\nP\nP\n \nPDF\nZPL 203

A second API is then called with a document identifier to return the Document or POD document details.\nScope\nThese versions of the APIs can return all Order types or just Transport Order data (shipments) and Documents or POD documents with detail.\nThe type of information available through the public API is the same as the one users can find on the MySupplyChain Track & Trace public web search without logging in.\n \nUsing the API\nThe Transport Orders Only API takes only 3 key parameters and is easy to setup.  \nAll that is needed is a Transport order reference and a country code for where the order originates.  The final parameter is a period of days in the past to search, this is a maximum of 120 days.\nThe All Order Types API takes only 3 key parameters in the first call.  An order reference, country code, and business partner ID are required.\nWithin the payload returned by this API will be a unique key,  \"order_id\", this must be used as the required parameter for the second API call.\nCalling the second API with the  \"order_id\" will return the Order Detail information regardless of the Order type.\nThe Document and POD documents API takes only one key parameter  in the first call.  An select is required with possibility to choose what to retrieve in response documents, pod_documents or both.\nWithin the payload returned by this API will be a unique key,  \"document_identifier\", this must be used as the required parameter for the second API call.\nCalling the second API with the  \"documentId\" for Documents or \"podId\" will return the detail for relevant document.\nIf you do not know your Business Partner ID is, then please reach out to your DHL MySupplyChain Track & Trace representative who will be able to provide this for you.\nThe MySupplyChain Track & Trace public API is a Restful API which uses GET HTTP requests.\nExample Use Cases\nFind the location of a shipment\nYou can use the API to help you build a website or application that enables DPDHL customers to see the location of their shipment.\n \nDiscover when a shipment will arrive\nYou can use the API to help you build a website or application that enables DPDHL customers to see when they can expect a delivery.\n \nGet information on shipment Status\nSome customers want to be informed of the current status of their request.   Is it \"Awaiting Dispatch\", \"In Transit\" or \"Delivered\".  These APIs can provide them with the information regarding shipment Status.   With the \"All Order Types\" API it is possible to return the status events for Purchase, Customer and Warehouse Orders along with the Transport Order information.  For example: have the goods been picked in the warehouse?\n \nCustomize my web application language\nCustomize your web application based on your users’ needs. You can use the API to create language-specific web applications, so that customers can track their shipment in their native language.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":487,"endCharIdx":5070,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"SyD/4QfZYYSRGaHic2b+luQExY7vp4UwvGvfSCmzQxI="},"6e92ea5b-ed92-454c-aa2b-4938caf4a3dc":{"id_":"6e92ea5b-ed92-454c-aa2b-4938caf4a3dc","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/track-and-trace-supply-chain"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f72e2783-44d6-47e7-b990-0460b55e37ea","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/track-and-trace-supply-chain"},"hash":"7ttcrdccJyK72QIBzO5wkaBIUvlGAiF0VNymy3rua+s="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bb782924-be6d-4db2-862d-a41cb96b4b78","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/track-and-trace-supply-chain"},"hash":"5HmXVIxZoOBRjy3JHWpbgd/6ff8jGV3CS0S/s43DvgE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"be6e836b-a77e-4a5b-9665-ae273450606a","metadata":{},"hash":"3dbrV6Suhmccv8E10SCv0h6HDxtZYMj6kJbc+vu1+Uw="}},"text":"User Guide\n \n \nGet Access\n All Orders Types &Transport Orders Only \nTransport Orders Only API requires an incident ticket in GSN as mentioned below.\nAll Orders Types API requires a Work Request in GSN for further engagement of DHL LINK Build team. .

API\n\nThis is the successful response which you will see when successfully authenticated.\nHTTP Response Status Code 200 OK\nThis is the failed response which you will see in the browser in case of invalid credentials.\nHTTP Response Status Code 401 UnauthorizedAvailable Authentication Methods\nDHL provides access to its APIs via the following mechanisms:\nAPI Key \nOAuth 2.0\nJWT (JSON Web Token)\nEach API will describe its particular access mechanism with regards of how to transmit the authentication within a single request.Credentials to use a certain API can be requested via the DHL Developer Portal.Resource Owner Password Grant Type\nFor Mobile and Desktop apps,  T&T Service supports the Resource Owner Password OAuth 2.0 grant type.This password grant type is for highly trusted apps where resource owners share their credentials directly with the app.Resource Owner Password Grant Type Roles\nThe Resource Owner Password grant type uses the following roles:\nResource Owner: A person or system capable of granting access to a protected resource.App: A client that makes protected requests using the authorization of the resource owner.Authorization Server (T&T): The server that issues access tokens to client apps after successfully authenticating the resource owner.Resource Server (T&T): The server that hosts protected resources and accepts and responds to protected resource requests using access tokens.Apps access the server through APIs.Resource Owner Password Flow\nThe diagram shows the flow for the Resource Owner Password grant type\n \nThe flow of the Resource Owner Password grant type is:\nAuthenticate: The user authenticates with the app using their username and password.POST /auth/oauth/token?grant_type=password: The app sends the username and password in Auth section (common technical user for all API calls but different per environment) and username and password in request body (different per customer) to the authorization server for validation.Response (access_token, token_type, refresh_token, expires_in, scope): The authorization server validates the username and password and response an access token, token_type, refresh_token, expires_in and scope.Request resource server: The app attempts to access the resource from the resource server by presenting the access token (instead of access token has to be used refresh token if access token expires).Return Resource: If the access token is valid, the resource server returns the resources that the user authorized the app to receive.Access Token\nAn OAuth Access Token is a string that the OAuth client uses to make requests to the resource server.Access tokens may be either \"bearer tokens\" or \"sender-constrained\" tokens.Sender-constrained tokens require the OAuth client to prove possession of a private key in some way in order to use the access token, such that the access token by itself would not be usable.JSON Web Token (JWT) access tokens conform to the JWT standard and contain information about an entity in the form of claims.They are self-contained therefore it is not necessary for the recipient to call a server to validate the token.Access tokens issued for the Management API and access tokens issued for any custom API that you have registered with Auth0 follow the JWT standard, which means that their basic structure conforms to the typical JWT structure, and they contain standard JWT claims asserted about the token itself.Refresh Token\nAn OAuth Access Token is a string that the OAuth client uses to make requests to the resource server.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"If+ZxMKtf9zAthGCmrV3X1V7M6HUXQuwgvf5v0dQ2s0="},"be6e836b-a77e-4a5b-9665-ae273450606a":{"id_":"be6e836b-a77e-4a5b-9665-ae273450606a","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/track-and-trace-supply-chain"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f72e2783-44d6-47e7-b990-0460b55e37ea","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/track-and-trace-supply-chain"},"hash":"7ttcrdccJyK72QIBzO5wkaBIUvlGAiF0VNymy3rua+s="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6e92ea5b-ed92-454c-aa2b-4938caf4a3dc","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/track-and-trace-supply-chain"},"hash":"7AWGkKL8UfR4eL6ICPfdhrRyVAPVj732PbszFIoIgS4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4be8258b-c65b-4d5d-b09b-b840bc260ff9","metadata":{},"hash":"aK1k0gex4MbXU3OI7w1r1XaoRIaqdhNjFoRUgNM36TM="}},"text":"Access

international palletized road freight transport orders (> 35 kg) across Europe.\n\n\nRegion: \nEurope\n\n\nUsed for: \nShipping,\nInformation\n\n\n\n\n \nOverview\nPrint API enables creating and printing transport documents that are related to relevant shipment bookings.\nUse Cases\nThere are 2 supported use cases for the Print API, especially with regards to creating barcode labels.\nCreating labels after you have created your bookings via the Booking API (preferred)\n\tEither use the shipment id (/print/printdocumentsbyid) or the complete response information (/print/printdocuments) from the Booking API in your request to the Print API.\n\tWhen using /print/printdocuments, you can copy the full segment shipment: { .....} from the Booking API into the shipment segment of the Print API and do not need to remove any non-matching fields that the Print API does not require. \nCreating standalone only labels, as your company transferred the bookings to DHL Freight via other means (e.g. EDI).\n\tIn this case, provide all details in your request (/print/printdocuments) to the Print API.Important: You must provide your own GS1 or ANSIFACT license plates as DHL Freight will not generate these for you. This use case assumes that you e.g. already created your bookings via EDI and have generated your own company license plates. You must provide your own license plates in your request to the Print API.\nDocument Types\nFollowing document types can be created:\nLabel, with license plate barcode types GS1 or Code128.\n\tFor each piece a label is created)\n\tPage type options:\n\tLabel (standard 1 label per page)\nLabel2xPortraitA4\nLabel3xLandscapeA4\nLabelCompact\n\nShipment List, containing one or multiple shipments you provided.\n\tThe Shipment List provides 2 copies, one for the consignor and one for the driver/chauffeur.\n\tAlso note that shipments are grouped per consignor per Shipment List. \nWaybill / CMR\nGuarantee  (only for Sweden and certain products)\nReturn Label (only for Sweden Parcel and certain products)\nPrint API Response\nThe Print API provides your requested document types in base64. You'll need to convert this base64 into PDF on your side.\nNote: In future the barcode label may also be returned directly in ZPL (Zebra Printer Language) . Contact us if you require this.\nAvailable Methods for above use cases\nYou can use following methods for your use case. \nPOST /print/printdocumentsbyid\n\tThis method is very easy to implement and strongly preferred to use, but is off course only available when you also created your bookings prior to the printing! You can simply provide an array of shipment id's and provide the relevant (print) options.\n\tPrecondition: you previously already created bookings and now provide your shipment id(s) to the Print API.\n\tNote that the response time will increase with large numbers of shipments and requesting multiple document types at the same time. Also the payload of the response in base64 will become larger. \nPOST /print/printdocuments\n\tYou can provide an array of shipments with all required shipment details for which you need to create e.g. labels or other documents. Note that the response time will increase with large numbers of shipments and requesting multiple document types at the same time. Also the payload of the response in base64 will become larger.\n\tYou can also use this method if you did not previously create bookings via the Booking API (= standalone usage of Print API), but you must provide your own generated license plates that you've already sent to DHL Freight via EDI.\nFor additional information, please contact api4freight@dhl.com\n\n\n\n \nUser Guide\nGet Access\nYou must request credentials for any applications you develop.

The customer benefits from these options in several ways:\nSimple exchange of information between the parties involved in the order.\nLean pre-notification and posting process.\nVia an Internet portal (AM.portal), Deutsche Post offers customers the option of tracking their postings from advance notice to posting to successful postal verification at the point of acceptance.\nFor pre-announced orders, invoicing can be done electronically.\nUsing the API\nAM can be used to map all product families of the Post corporate division and all franking types, i.e.:\nDIALOGPOST\nLetter Mail\nPOSTAKTUELL \nPostwurf Special\nPress Distribution products\nProducts international\nAM.exchange\nAM.exchange is the B2B protocol for electronic data exchange between customers, system partners and Deutsche Post.\nAM.portal\nAM.portal is an Internet portal that provides customers and system partners using the AM.exchange protocol with information on orders and order status.\n\nFigure: Overview of data communication between customer and Deutsche Post\n \nBrief overview of AM.exchange protocol\nThe AM.exchange protocol provides a collection of messages, so-called requests and responses, for the exchange of information with the order management system of Deutsche Post AG. The corresponding OrderManagement service is used to exchange order-related information.\nOrder Management Interface \nThe Order Management interface is used to exchange order-related information. The core of this message collection is the message for order creation: service operation createOrder. In addition, further service operations are available: changeOrder (change of an order), cancelOrder (cancellation of an order), seekOrder (search for orders), getOrder (loading of an order) and seekOrderMessage (search for system messages).\nThe following information collection provides IT project managers and software developers with all the important information on the subject of Deutsche Post's AM.exchange protocol. Among other things, it answers the following questions:\nWhat possibilities does the AM.exchange protocol offer?\nWhat do the processes look like in detail?\nWhat data is exchanged?\nWhich technical transmission channels can be used?\nWhich products and franking types are supported?\nWhat testing options are available?\nWho is the contact person for questions about AM.exchange?\nWe have more details for you in the Developer's Guide \nPlease note the following information on the currently valid order management versions:\nThe Developer's Manual in version 5.3.1 contains the specifications changed as of 01/01/2025 with regard to additional Order – Teilleistung Brief as well as  discount - changes for  Dialogpost and is thus applicable for developers who want to implement these specifications.\nThe Developer's Manual in version 5.2.3 contains the specifications valid until 31/12/2024 with regard to additional Order – Teilleistung Brief and is thus applicable for developers who want to implement and productively use these specifications in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nData transmission channels\nDeutsche Post offers its customers two data transmission channels. Each customer can decide which of the following options to use, depending on the technical options available to them and the use case:\nSOAP-Webservice\nCommunication with the AM.Exchange web service with order management runs exclusively on the basis of SOAP via https. This ensures secure, encrypted transmission of data between customers and Deutsche Post. The web service enables synchronous data communication between customers and Deutsche Post, which means that the connection remains established until the request has been answered and the caller can then process the response immediately.\nSecure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)\nThe use of SFTP is very similar to FTP from the user's point of view. However, a significant difference is that with the SFTP protocol the data is encrypted during data transfer by using the SSH protocol. With this type of transfer, communication is asynchronous, i.e. the customer places a file with the response on the SFTP account assigned to him and receives a file with the response in the same account as soon as processing of the request is complete.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":1459,"endCharIdx":6460,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"52bTMQBvGW8ZSZnda77F3CZZuMRU150JQyzkTYsOHjA="},"c831fd19-5b1a-434f-8fbf-97ad71ae4f26":{"id_":"c831fd19-5b1a-434f-8fbf-97ad71ae4f26","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/auftragsmanagement-am"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"114428fb-cb8d-4aa2-9227-3181aefcb66a","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/auftragsmanagement-am"},"hash":"MHlI/87rbJztwb4eWbdCzV8yGVAH3j+S8elXJgZTUMU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"961e88e3-90bb-4e1b-a329-b350736fa66c","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/auftragsmanagement-am"},"hash":"WMF2jED5BjeoxzU/kLHyvEM8l5h4pC5YWxa5wI/4TVQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6d728f19-08db-43f9-b3ec-8166959deef2","metadata":{},"hash":"G+po2qa8wrwp4HoiX9zJVeU1veJzo4cI1gfrKzgInqI="}},"text":"Support / Contact\nDo you have questions about the listed interfaces?

resource affordances and link relations between resources.Any non-error response of application/json media type shall be interpreted as defined in RESTful JSON(link is external) specification.JSON-LD\nFurthermore, the RESTful JSON responses are in JSON-LD-compatible(link is external) format.General conventions\nEnums defined in the API response entities might hold just a subset of possible values (e.g.new values can be added to enum in future non-breaking versions).In the case, when the value doesn’t meet clients expectation, client should process it as undefined.Error Message Format\nIn the case of error, the application/problem+json (Problem Detail(link is external)) is used to communicate details about an error.Date & Time format\nDate and Time always conform to the ISO 8601 format e.g.: 2017-06-21T14:07:17+2:00 (date time) or 2017-06-21T14:07:17Z (date time) or 2017-06-21 (date).If no time zone information is provided the time zone should be interpreted as in the place of the respective shipment event.Error Responses\nThis API might use the full range of common HTTP response statuses(link is external) as defined in RFC7231(link is external).This API documentation shows only the 404 for illustration purposes on how an error response might look like.Language\nThe API request might return localized messages (e.g.human readable description of a shipment status code).It is possible to indicate the language preferred by the calling user agent using the language query parameter.If the requested language is not available but the shipment is still found the API returns a successful response and indicates the actual langaguage of the response in the Content-Language header.API Client Recommendation\nClients of the API should expect, that enums defined in the API response entities might hold just subset of possible values (e.g.new values can be added to enum in future non-breaking versions).In the case, when the value doesn’t meet clients expectation, client should process it as undefined.Clients are advised, that optional fields may not be included in response when their value is not defined.Selecting the preferred language\nThe API request can return localized messages (e.g.a human readable description of a shipment status code).To select your preferred language:\nUse the language query parameter when calling the user agent.If the requested language is not available but the shipment is still found, the API returns a successful response and indicates the actual language of the response in the Content-Language header.Permitted HTTP methods\nHTTP method\nUse this to:\nGET\n\nRetrieve data\n\nHTTP method\nUse this to:\nGET\n\nRetrieve data\n\n \nDHL Parcel queries and responses\nDHL Parcel

\nOverview\nYou are on the documentation page of the DHL DATAFACTORY AUTOCOMPLETE 2.0 API of Post Direkt. In the following chapters we offer you:\nAn Overview of the business functions covered via the API\nThe technical documentation of the API\n\tThe User Guide describes connections and authentication\nOpen API Specification in Reference Docs\nCode examples in Use Cases,\n\nYou can find contact information for further support and a Testsuite in chapter Additional Information\nScope\nDATAFACTORY AUTOCOMPLETE 2.0 from Deutsche Post Direkt offers effective assistance in recording address data. Once integrated into your IT infrastructure, postal data can be simply and conveniently augmented on the basis of original Deutsche Post postcode data.\nAs soon as the first alphanumerical characters have been entered into the input field, your users will receive up to 15 suggestions to complete the address fields. A total of around 1.2 million different address suggestions are available, including all delivery-relevant streets, more than 16,000 postcodes associated with destinations, 14,000 town/ city names, 75,000 town district names, 7,000 postal retail outlets and 4,000 PACKSTATIONS.\nBasis for automatic completion is the street directory based on the original Deutsche Post postal routing data. In addition, the API has been expanded to include the building directory, which makes it possible to complete the house number. This also makes it possible to generate a routing code, which is required for parcel delivery. You can access up-to-date postal data quickly and securely via an interface connection and encryption.\nUsing the API\nDATAFACTORY AUTOCOMPLETE 2.0 is based on Representational State Transfer (REST).\nThe requests are implemented using HTTP GET requests. The base uniform resource locator (URL) for this service is: https://autocomplete2.postdirekt.de/autocomplete2\nThe following sections describe the uniform resource identifiers (URIs) with which the requests can be implemented.\n \nNote: \nURI is understood here as a resource identifier as opposed to a resource locator URL.\nExample:\nhttps://autocomplete2.postdirekt.de/autocomplete2/search/de/postalcodes_cities?postal_code=05\nhttps://autocomplete2.postdirekt.de/autocomplete2 is the base URL\n/search/de/postalcodes_cities?postal_code=05 is the URI\nThe interface offers two functions. The \"search\" function accepts structured address fragments and provides suitable suggestions. Each of these suggestions is delivered with an ID. This ID is used to call the \"select\" function as soon as one of the suggestions is selected and serves to improve the generation of suggestions.\nInput suggestions\nA suggestion represents a completion of the data entered.\nThe following types of requests are available, each of which returns unique suggestions. The selection is made by selecting the path of the call:\nSuggested postal codes\nSuggested towns/cities\nSuggested districts\nSuggested streets\nSuggested Packstations\nSuggested Deutsche Post retail outlets\nSuggested possible combinations of postal code and town/city\nSuggested possible combinations of postal code, town/city and district\nSuggested possible combinations of postal code, town/city and street\nSuggested possible combinations of all elements\nSuggested building data including house number suffix (if ordered)\n\nDATAFACORY AUTOCOMPLETE will answer each request with up to fifteen suggestions. A request can be pre-filtered using three different address types (A, F, P).","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":2512,"endCharIdx":6382,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wWig0ER2ACdwyJasq9a1hOkrPccDY3E/rJP++4UVLgM="},"b7612976-de9b-4ad4-be3f-6ec2d0ce58cb":{"id_":"b7612976-de9b-4ad4-be3f-6ec2d0ce58cb","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/datafactory-autocomplete-20-post-parcel-germany"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"515ed389-7b57-4eb2-ab9d-3e7df9541142","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/datafactory-autocomplete-20-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"QuZR25zh8591GPQ2YUEUeR22rlA1Nv1zYxjd02hDgRk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"da806198-15a8-42b3-bbd6-312f1ed00b59","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/datafactory-autocomplete-20-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"zAm32pYSMjIRQqA2lomwlx8TJz01IpitwueD1H4hgbo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c4bf8166-8872-44c9-a0cf-7cf3aa9ec401","metadata":{},"hash":"NTtLcbBRm0PqaHp2B71WNix0FPsQE29YGnhnvqJo+qQ="}},"text":"User Guide\nThe following provides an overview on how to get access to the API.\nTechnical Details on the API calls can be found here: \"API Specification\".\nFurther hints on API usage are given in the section \"Additioinal Information\".\nGet Access\nA prerequisite for this use of DATAFACTORY AUTCOMPLETE 2 is a contractual agreement, authorization by approval from POST DIREKT, authentication by the CUSTOMER by entering a user name and password, and transmission of the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier / Identifier) when the CUSTOMER selects a proposal.\nApply for release\nRequest an offer(link sends email)\nDeutsche Post Direkt GmbH\nJunkersring 57\n53844 Troisdorf\nFon +49 2241 2661-0\nFax +49 2241 2661-1111\nAuthentication\nThe user of the interface requires an account that has received the necessary authorization for Autocomplete 2 from Deutsche Post Direkt.

Check if a different first name and/or last name is being used (some people have multiple first names and use them differently).\n•    The customer provided a nickname during registration for a DHL customer account or when entering the address in the validation form, e.g., \"Loki\" instead of \"Hannelore\" or \"Rosi\" instead of \"Roswitha.\"\n•    Check if the first and last names are being used in the correct order.\n•    A title is provided (e.g., Dr., Prof., Graf) that was not provided during registration for a DHL customer account.\n•    The customer has provided only an abbreviation as the first name for addressing purposes (e.g., \"H. Schmidt\").\n•    The customer identified themselves with an ID card for the DHL customer account, and DHL has taken a different official last name than the one used by the customer in daily transactions (e.g., \"Katrin Edle von Giesheim Halbertshausen zu Schreckstein\" uses the name \"Katrin von Giesheim\" in daily transactions).\n•    Name change due to official measures (e.g., marriage, gender reassignment, unreasonable name) that has not been stored or updated in the DHL customer account.\nWhat are the most common reasons for a \"false\" result?\nThe most common reasons are improper use of the customer account (multiple family members using the same account, addressing to a Packstation without being enabled for the service):\n•    The customer tries to use the Packstation account of a roommate/partner, etc., but orders under their own name.\n•    The customer is not (yet) a customer of DHL or has not yet booked the Packstation service. In this case, they still receive a postal code that, for example, serves direct addressing to a branch.\n•    Typo in the postal code.\nWhat business logic does DHL recommend when the API returns \"false\"?\nThis depends on the sensitivity of the shipped goods. For general goods, we recommend using the API only for pre-validation and providing the end customer with a notification that the shipment may not be deliverable.\nIf applicable, offer your customers the option to bypass the validation and set up a warning message. You can also split the string of a name and query them against the API one by one.\nWhy doesn't DHL use \"Fuzzy Logic\" or similar to return \"true\" for names that are likely similar?\nSome of our business customers have strict requirements for recipient identity verification because the delivery must not be delivered to third parties (content sensitive, subject to credit or identity checks). For this reason, we allow business customers to perform a precise validation before shipment and build their own business logic on top of it.\n \n\n\n\n \nSupport\nYou can request support in our Help Center. You can raise a ticket that allows you to request direct support from DHL Support. Please describe your enquiry in as much detail as possible and also send us reproducible extracts from the web service communication.

shutdown can be found here.You are on the documentation page of the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API of Post & Parcel Germany.In the following chapters we offer you:\nAn Overview of the business functions covered via the API\nThe technical documentation of the API\n\tThe User Guide contains topics of connection and authentication\nPostman Collection\nOpen API Specification and code examples in Reference Docs\n\nFind further Use Cases, FAQ and Support Contact in section Additional Information\nLatest Release Notes\n\t \nScope\nThe DHL Parcel DE Shipping API permits the management of shipments and the online purchase of postage and is typically aimed at senders with a volume of more than 200 shipments per year.For DHL business customers who do not have a DHL business customer account (EKP) and who have a shipping volume of less than 200 shipments per year, shipping documents are created via the DHL private customer shipping API.Using the API\nThe DHL Parcel DE Shipping API takes care of:\nThe preparation of shipping documents for national and international shipping\nCreation of export documents\nRetrieval of labels\nGeneral basics\nTo connect the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API to your systems, we would like to give you an overview on shipping of goods with Deutsche Post DHL for business customers.To create business customer shipments, you (or your customer) need(s) a business customer contract and access to the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal (GKP).The DHL Parcel DE Shipping API must be set up precisely for these contractually agreed products and services.In addition, the user access data to the GKP, all used billing numbers, sender and return addresses and bank account data must be implemented as configurable attributes.There are two types of users: system users and personal users.System users can be used for system connections or webservices only.Logging in to the GKP interface is not possible with them.Personal users, on the other hand, are created for the usage in the GKP GUI.The access data to the GKP consists of a username and a password.The username can, for example, consist of first and last names and may only contain lowercase letters and certain special characters.The password must comply with the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal guidelines in order to meet certain security criteria: It must be at least 8 characters and no more than 20 characters long, contain at least one special character (!,$,/,(,),=,#,*,+), at least one letter and at least one number.Be sure to use the correct upper- and lower-case  spelling when entering the password.Password validity is 365 days for system users and 90 days for personal users.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AkOKbR4Bj+frlu+6aUng8WOBlt+Djl8aa+Wb2eBWOLc="},"58631aab-c941-4b61-be34-a37cde324932":{"id_":"58631aab-c941-4b61-be34-a37cde324932","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-de-shipping-post-parcel-germany-v2"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"83776c5e-4a72-4ae4-9192-0a45ffb4adbb","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-de-shipping-post-parcel-germany-v2"},"hash":"NsVPb1cCov1YJGVNGOkAVINkiqf78W8RpONizhSis6s="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"eca36385-984e-455c-a969-a1e26fc5c8e8","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-de-shipping-post-parcel-germany-v2"},"hash":"AkOKbR4Bj+frlu+6aUng8WOBlt+Djl8aa+Wb2eBWOLc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6773b833-25f3-40c0-821e-0fbf1b6f836c","metadata":{},"hash":"rkSdme32ys1bh4ZnlNLkS8uuTljb0NEn99Ludh9UgLk="}},"text":"There

lower-case  spelling when entering the password.Password validity is 365 days for system users and 90 days for personal users.Users will be informed by e-mail before a password expires and will also receive a link to assign a new password in this e-mail.If the link in the e-mail has expired or if a user has not received an e-mail, they can use the \"Forgot Password?\"function on the GKP login page (https://geschaeftskunden.dhl.de/(link is external)) to assign a new password.EKP: The EKP is a \"uniform customer and product number\" and thus the key to using Deutsche Post DHL products.It consists of ten digits and is created and assigned by the DHL sales team.Each customer can be uniquely identified via this EKP.It is required for all system connections and must always be transferred.Contract Procedure: The products used for shipping are referred to as contract procedure.You can find more information about the products here.Contract Participation: The so-called contract participation is a two-digit numeric (00 to 99) or alphanumeric (AA to ZZ) character string.It is assigned by the DHL sales team.For each product (so-called contract procedure) a customer can use one or more contract participations.It is therefore recommended to keep the number of contract participations variable when configuring the interface.The contract participations enable a subdivision, for example, according to locations, seasonal business or different conditions.In addition, certain services, such as environmentally friendly shipping with GoGreen, are also stored as separate contract participations.Bank account data: Bank data is only required if the cash on delivery service is enabled.Details of IBAN, BIC, payee, bank name and reason for payment must be entered here.Contract Billing Number: The billing number is a 14-character string.It consists of the EKP, the contract procedure (=product) and the contract participation.The correct spelling is without spaces or special characters (all 14 characters directly one after the other).Example:\n1234567890\n53\n01\nEKP\nContract Procedure\nContract Participation\n1234567890\n53\n01\nEKP\nContract Procedure\nContract Participation\nLabel format and printing\nThe DHL Parcel DE Shipping API offers all label formats, which are also available in the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal.We would like to point out that scaling of the label is not permitted, as this no longer guarantees the legibility of the label.Shipments for which machine readability is not possible will be invoiced to the sender with an additional charge for the required manual post-processing.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fH6U0kiOKXTbmzNEKKOElBsGLML8rYtROcXn5r0hdew="},"6773b833-25f3-40c0-821e-0fbf1b6f836c":{"id_":"6773b833-25f3-40c0-821e-0fbf1b6f836c","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-de-shipping-post-parcel-germany-v2"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"83776c5e-4a72-4ae4-9192-0a45ffb4adbb","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-de-shipping-post-parcel-germany-v2"},"hash":"NsVPb1cCov1YJGVNGOkAVINkiqf78W8RpONizhSis6s="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"58631aab-c941-4b61-be34-a37cde324932","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-de-shipping-post-parcel-germany-v2"},"hash":"RTbtODVHpf/hn18DAEQ7+iiLLqlTJGFdPI5fl8UJl9E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"163d3a9c-37c5-496c-9875-6ce8f89fe6d6","metadata":{},"hash":"GKCHOfqsXuTjLue9gN2lIQLzQXISXjh48TGk+/jSHmw="}},"text":"Details

which machine readability is not possible will be invoiced to the sender with an additional charge for the required manual post-processing.The following label formats are currently available (printFormat):\n\"A4\" Common Label laser printing A4 plain paper\n\"910-300-700\" Common Label laser printing (sheet A5) 105x208mm (910-300-700)\n\"910-300-700-oz\" Common Label laser printing (sheet

105x148mm, without additional labels (910-300-300)\nAdditionally, the label format 100 x 70 mm can be used, but exclusively for the products Warenpost and Warenpost International.Please note that some information cannot be printed on this label due to its smaller size.The following rules therefore apply to address data on this label format:\nSender: Name 2 and Name 3 are not printed\nFor German consignee addresses, Name 3 is  is not printed\nFor international addresses, 6 lines are printed, with the last line always being the consignee country.Label printing with a thermal printer corresponds to a resolution of 203dpi.We ask you to take this into account accordingly so that a smooth production run is possible.Note on the Returning the label as a pure data structure: Returning the label information as a pure data structure (e.g.in XML format) without returning the actual label is not possible via the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API.However, the web service response contains all data attributes generated by DHL that are printed on the label (e.g.shipment number, routing code).Printer settings in the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal\nIf all users are to use the same printer settings, these can be configured uniformly in the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal via the section \"Parcel & Goods > Ship > Settings > General settings\".In the \"Customize settings for users\" section, select the \"All users\" entry and make the desired printer settings in the same screen.If different printer settings are required for individual users, these can be configured in the same mask.Select the entry of the desired user in the \"Customize settings for users\" section and then make the desired settings.The printer settings stored in the GKP are also valid for the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API.Only for requests which contain explicit printer settings, these will be used instead of the settings stored in the GKP for this transmission only (printFormat, retourePrintFormat, combine).Shipments manifests\nShipments are initially stored without passing on the electronic shipment data (PAN data) until they are manifested.Manifesting means that the shipment data is finally transferred to the Post & DHL backend systems.This takes place as part of the so-called end of day closing.For shipments that were created via webservice, the end of day closing takes place either automatically at a specified time at the end of the day or via the \"/manifest\" method.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"x5T/blLKaPFO+R/t0IK06S+8JUloFEiOHcs0AXWvpVc="},"163d3a9c-37c5-496c-9875-6ce8f89fe6d6":{"id_":"163d3a9c-37c5-496c-9875-6ce8f89fe6d6","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-de-shipping-post-parcel-germany-v2"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"83776c5e-4a72-4ae4-9192-0a45ffb4adbb","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-de-shipping-post-parcel-germany-v2"},"hash":"NsVPb1cCov1YJGVNGOkAVINkiqf78W8RpONizhSis6s="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6773b833-25f3-40c0-821e-0fbf1b6f836c","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-de-shipping-post-parcel-germany-v2"},"hash":"rkSdme32ys1bh4ZnlNLkS8uuTljb0NEn99Ludh9UgLk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b24857d4-8855-4e9f-9b09-16fd1ac040be","metadata":{},"hash":"jArsrVyx4MlGby4PquGL92t+iSW9cRN2obGcW5W/5Pg="}},"text":"If

regular end of day closing takes place by default at 5:45 pm or at the time that has been individually set by the customer.These settings can be configured in the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal via the section \"Parcel & Goods > Ship > Settings > Notifications & end of day time\".Shipments can only be edited if they have not yet been manifested, i.e. if they have not yet been included in the end of day closing.Special case for shipments with the product DHL Paket International:\nFor shipments with DHL Paket International, it is mandatory that they are manifested before they are physically handed over to the international postal companies.To ensure that the data for these shipments is transferred to the DHL systems on time, an additional automatic end of day closing has been set up especially for shipments with DHL Paket International.This takes place daily at 8:45 pm and includes all international shipments that were created after the regular end of day closing.Editing a shipment\nA manifested shipment can no longer be edited.As long as a shipment has not yet been manifested, it can be deleted by calling “DELETE /orders”.A new shipment with the corrected data can then be created using “POST /orders\nRoles and rights\nFor the usage of the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API the same user model applies as for online access via the function Ship in the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal.This means that users and their permissions can be created, deleted or changed in the \"Manage users\" section of the GKP.Users can be assigned to a specific user group profile.The user group profile defines the set of billing numbers that a user of this profile is entitled to use.Both personal users and system users are assigned to a user group profile.If you are unsure which user group profile to use, please contact your administrator.The administrator can view and edit the user group profile assignments in the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal under \"Parcel & goods > Ship > Settings > User groups\".Products and services via the web service interface \n\nProducts\nShipments can be created using the API function POST \"/orders\".All products are handed over in the web service attribute \"product\" and validated by the \"contract procedure\" in the contract billing number.The contract procedures and  product codes to be used can be found in the following

You will receive a notice, once your APP has been approved.\nHere you can find more help on how to register an app.\nAuthentication\nAccess Token\nTo access the API resources of the Post & Parcel Germany APIs, you must first verify yourself against our Authentication API. In exchange, you will receive the Access Token required for further requests. Please follow the instructions of the Authentication API (Post & Paket Deutschland) to get an Access Token.\nPlease note: You've been already granted to use the Authentication API (Post & Parcel Germany) automatically, when you have access to this specific API. There is no further action required on your part.\nAlternatively, you can use Basic Auth (Username: \"user-valid\", Password: \"SandboxPasswort2023!\") for authentication and additionally provide your API key (take it from the firstly generated APP) as request header information (\"dhl-api-key\"). Please note that we will no longer offer Basic Auth in future API versions.

the old Business Customer Shipping API (SOAP)?The documentation of the old Business Customer Shipping API (SOAP) is available in the download area of the Group API Developer Portal.Please raise a support ticket to get access.It is recommended to switch to the latest DHL Parcel Shipping API.How to find the Download Area in the Group API Developer Portal: Navigate to your private settings via the person symbol at the top right and then activate the \"Downloads\" tab.You will then find the \"Documentation Developer Portal\" area after approval.Where can I find samples for authentication?Please refer to the section on authentication at the User Guide .This also has a curl example.My setup works for getVersion() but I get HTTP 401 for all other calls.Please check the GKP credentials (they are provided via basic auth header).getVersion() (GET call on API URI) does not require those, but all other calls do.I requested access and did not hear back for 48 hours or more.Please reach out via contact form  Help Center..Approval is not automatic as long as we are in Early Access or Beta.Encoding\nWhat encoding should I use for API calls?You should use UTF-8 encoding for all API calls.Using UTF-8 ensures that all characters are correctly interpreted and processed, especially if your data contains non-ASCII characters.Using a different encoding might result in errors or unexpected results.Label Formatting and Printing\nCan I modify the side margin when printing ZPL label?A client reported successfully using the following: Before sending the received ZPL file to the printer: “I add on the fly a ZPL command (^LS-30) just after the beginning of ZPL Data (^XA command).”Can I retrieve only the relevant data attributes instead of the label?Returning the label information as a pure data structure (e.g.in XML format) without returning the actual label is not possible via the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API.However, the web service response contains all data attributes generated by DHL that are printed on the label (e.g.shipment number, routing code).Request Document\nDo you support multi-piece shipments?No, multi-parcel shipments are not supported.To make it clear to your customers on the shipping label that several parcels belong to one order, you can use the “costCenter” attribute and enter “1/2”, “2/2”, for example.ShipperRef attribute -- how to use\nYou need to set the reference to a shipper (address details) in the business customer portal under “Parcel & goods -> Ship -> Address book -> Sender” and may then refer to this shipper via the shipperRef attribute.In that case, no shipper details are needed.If both are provided, the explicit information will be applied.A hard validation error with HTTP 400 occurs if the shipper reference is unknown.Weight\nShipment weight is important for billing.This is a mandatory attribute.You can provide shipment weight in either kg or g unit.If shipping internationally and needing customs data: Similar rules apply for individual item weights.Dimensions\nProviding dimensions (length, width, height) are optional.Adherance to product limitations will be checked by DHL.If you choose to provide that data, all attributs (unit of measure, length, height, width) are required.Packstation Addresses\nPlease refer to sample included in the API specification.A packstation destination is identified by providing the lockerID attribute.additionalAddressInformation1 and additionalAddressInformation2 elements of the consignee address\nPlease check the API specification.Those elements are not printed for most labels.Exceptions include Parcel International labels for selected countries.Label Download\nHow long are the labels available for download via

available for download via /labels URL?The labels are available for download until they have been manifested.After an initial download (and only then), the labels are being cached for currently 48 h.This means that labels can be downloaded for up to 48 h after manifesting.Note that after this time expired you receive HTTP 500.Via the GET /orders call, labels can be retrieved again up to three days after manifesting.A specific shipment number must be added to the call.Services\nI set premium=false but PREMIUM is still printed on the label?This is country-specific.Most EU countries do not offer economy products, so premium=true is applied.Other countries (CH) offer both.COD (cash on delivery) - cannot provide the full bank account data\nDepending on the GKP account privileges you may be required to create the account in the business customer portal and refer to it via AccountReference attribute in the API.Retoure international\nThis is NOT supported on this API.Please check the Parcel DE Returns API.You can create return labels for standard domestic parcels.Customs Information\nWhen providing customs information, do I need to provide it for each item I plan to ship?Yes.Will I need to provide customs information?Depends on origin and destination address.Whenever shipping internationally and not covered differently.(E.g., You don't need it when shipping within the European customs union).Northern Ireland is part of the European customs union.Therefore, shipments to UK containing postal codes starting with “BT” do not require customs information.Manifest\nGet / manifest appears slow on the sandbox\nThe sandbox accounts are heavily shared.All customers with a sandbox account can create shipments on the sandbox environment.The manifest-all call may apply to a large number of shipments and therefore, the call might take longer.Please note: The production behavior is different since your manifests are exclusively related to your shipments.Can I get a manifest for each billing number?Yes, you can create a manifest for each billing number.To do this, use the “billingNumber” attribute in the “POST /manifest” call.Yes, you can create a manifest for each billing number.To do this, use the “billingNumber” attribute in the “POST /manifest” call.When is Manifest done?Do I have to do it?It is done automatically at a pre-agreed time, usually the end of your working day.Afterwards shipments cannot be changed and labels (unless cached) cannot be downloaded.You can trigger manifesting explicitly via API as well (POST /manifest).Version\nDo I need to call this?This helps you as a quick connectivity check and also tells you the current version number.Part of the response is like \"version\": \"v2.0.2\" - the version of the API.Updates in the last component -- patch level -- will not be announced, they are guaranteed to be compatible.Errors\nGeneral Hints\nPLEASE use the validation switch available for POST /orders.It will tell you if you are

and want to migrate to REST.What do I need to know?You should speak with your DHL sales representative.Likely you will need new billing numbers to avoid clashing number ranges between your Easylog shipments and shipments generated via API.How long does the activation take to use the production environment?You should have received the activation of the production API within 1-3 working days.Will I use the same key for PROD and SANDBOX?If you have requested access to both sandbox and production products in the same app, the same key will typically be enabled for both PROD and SANDBOX.We can set you up based on your preferences.We can also add PROD access if you had originally only requested sandbox access.\n\n\n\n \nSupport\n\n\n\n\nYou can request support in our Help Center.

\"You\"/\"Your\") need to have an active customer account with Post & DHL Business Customer Portal (hereinafter referred to as \"DHL\").An API Productive Key and access details will be provided to You subject to a successful validation of Your credentials by DHL.If You engage an external developer, or other IT services provider to develop Your Application or any other third party to access and/or use the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API on Your behalf, You remain fully liable for any acts or omissions of such Third Parties in connection with the access to and/or usage of the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API.These Legal Terms do not replace and/or modify the applicable \"General Terms and Conditions of DHL Parcel for business customers\", available at https://www.dhl.de/en/geschaeftskunden/paket/rund-um-den-versand/agb.html or any other shipment services agreement, which govern Your parcel shipments.In case You act as a third party software, vendor, marketplace or otherwise as commercial agent on DHL's and/or its affiliates' behalf, i.e. with DHL's and/or its affiliates' consent, You are obliged to refer the customer (i.e. the sender of the shipments) to the applicable terms and conditions for shipment.You shall use the services and/or data that You receive via the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API only for the legitimate contractual purposes and only in connection with Your or the shipping customers DHL shipments.The following prerequisites and/or restrictions apply for the usage of and/or access to the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API:\nThe DHL Parcel DE Shipping API provides the possibility to create and print shipping labels and to book shipments.Please be aware that the booking of the shipment within DHL Parcel DE Shipping API does not constitute the contract of carriage.The contract of carriage will only be concluded when the shipment is handed over or picked up and accepted by DHL.Please note that the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API only facilitates shipments from Germany to Germany and from Germany to other countries.Creating shipping documents from abroad to Germany and from abroad to abroad is not possible via the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API .Please note, that the standard implementation of the functionality \"Print Label and Export Documents\" (createShipmentOrder) is as PDF label; an implementation according to the\" Common Label specification\" requires a separate approval by DHL.You need to configure your Post & DHL business customer portal (account number or \"EKP\", procedures, products, services etc.) according to the necessities of the DHL Parcel DE Shipping API.If you act as a third party vendor or marketplace, these configurations need to be implemented for each shipping customer (merchant) individually.Credentials (user / password) for the Post & DHL business customer portal need to be delivered/shared within the XML Request.When using the service \"cash-on-delivery\" (\"Nachnahme\") bank details (incl.BIC and IBAN data for national and international transfers) need to be delivered/shared within the XML Request.You shall implement the functionality \"Cancel Shipment\" (deleteShipmentOrder) within your Application.For all products value for the weight must necessarily be delivered.This value may have a predefined default value (only for contractually agreed fixed prices in procedure 01 (\"Verfahren 01\")) or consist of the specific weight of the shipment.Accordingly, the detection / default must be displayed in the e-shop or marketplace.You need

\n2.1.11\n23.Sep.2024\nIntroduction of the authentication method OAuth2 parallel to the current Basic Auth. Later API versions will no longer support Basic Auth.\n\n\n\n \n2.1.10\n10.Jul.2024\nThe \"status\" attribute is added to the web service response. It contains the same value as the existing \"statusCode\" attribute. This backwards-compatible extension ensures conformity with RFC 7807.\nThe attributes \"name2\" and \"name3\" are now printed on the label when a returns label is ordered.\nIf a sender phone number is transmitted when ordering a dutiable international shipment, it will be printed on the CN23 form.\nBug fix for GET /orders call for international shipments with service cash on delivery.\nWhen using Packstations, the shipment number to be scanned could often not be identified on the package label because the naming of the barcodes was not clear. Therefore, the barcodes are now labeled \"Sendungsnummer\" or \"Shipment Identifier / numéro de l'envoi\" instead of the old designation \"Identcode/License Plate\".\nOn all domestic shipments within Germany and on all DHL Paket International shipments, weights over 10kg or over 20kg are now indicated. The new weight symbols are printed above the weight information on the labels.\n\n\n\n \n2.1.9\n29.May.2024\nThe routing code of the consignee’s address is added to the webservice response.\nBug fix for retrieving labels of international shipments via GET /orders.\nBug fix for GET /manifests call with return type URL.\n\n\n\n \n2.1.8\n25.Jan.2024\nThe Movement Reference Number (MRN) can now be transferred as an optional parameter in the request when ordering an international shipment.\nIn the customs declaration, up to 99 goods items can now be transferred in the request.\nCorrection of enum values of attribute “printFormat” of the objects “Document” and “GetManifestData”.\n\n\n\n\n \n2.1.7\n12.Oct.2023\nThe service „shipping confirmation” has been removed from the section “value added services” (VAS).

This web service allows business customers to create return labels on demand.\nScenarios\nMain Scenario: Creating a returnlabel\nThis is achieved by posting a return order to the URI '/rest/orders'. The service will respond with a return label.\nQuerying to get receiver locations\nThe single scenario supported by this service is the determination of the receiver's location. This is achieved by getting a location to the URI '/rest/locations'. The service will respond with a Receiver.\nTechnical Note on Authorization\nThis API supports two alternative ways to authorize yourself:\n\nCombination of Apikey and Basic Authentication which you can provide with every call.\nOAuth2 Password Flow: After having obtained your access token once, you provide this token as bearer token.\n\nYou can try it out here.

If a longer value is transferred in the request, it is shortened accordingly.\n2. EORI number\nThe \"Economic Operators Registration and Identification\" (EORI) number has been added to return recipients with sender country Switzerland or the United Kingdom in April 2023. The EORI must be specified in the import process for returns. \nThe EORI number field will be expanded to 22 characters so that customers with headquarters abroad can now add the German branch number to the foreign EORI number.\nYou can enter the EORI number for your return recipients with the sender country Switzerland or the United Kingdom by navigating to \"Returns -> Settings\" in the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal and editing the corresponding return recipients there.

With effect from April 1, 2023, DHL Retoure International (returns API) will be expanded to include the mandatory fields of the CN23 document for the United Kingdom, as is the case now with Switzerland. Transmission of the required customs information will therefore be mandatory for Switzerland and the United Kingdom in the future.\nWhat this means for you specifically is that with requests for the sending country “United Kingdom” the information for the CN23 document must be included as an obligatory field via the object “customsDetails“. The array “items” in this object must contain at least one goods item. Here we would like to note that the two fields “countryOfOrigin“ and “hsCode“ are optional entries but should nonetheless also be transmitted in order to simplify imports to Germany and avoid possible transit time delays. These two values will also be printed on the CN23 document in future.\nPlease note that due to the Northern Ireland Protocol negotiated between the UK and the European Union, DHL Retoure International is not subject to customs processes or customs registrations for items being returned from Northern Ireland. Effective April 1, 2023, therefore, no data need be transmitted for returns from Northern Ireland, the postal codes for which always begin with “BT”.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":27781,"endCharIdx":31861,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6UzlfbwRFtCkirDBS/Z/URRhDfjUmh3mkO5qeQML1PQ="},"a769c7fd-c3b3-490d-a842-a67e7457e9ae":{"id_":"a769c7fd-c3b3-490d-a842-a67e7457e9ae","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/dhl-paket-de-retoure-post-paket-deutschland"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"b853a688-3a74-462b-92e7-8b5415a706ea","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/dhl-paket-de-retoure-post-paket-deutschland"},"hash":"i5AUAcyrTwirVyaHb4sCVCnXYwZzSQ/f3xVEkLiBrX8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"90406558-c2fd-4dd1-9cc1-0031037a08fc","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/dhl-paket-de-retoure-post-paket-deutschland"},"hash":"sLtldUeMzoTyrdeurq+6K3YTXqppkN7w2DFu+Ms/EIo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4a1e23ad-feb6-4b01-addb-9abaadcef815","metadata":{},"hash":"fXCaXsfLHe9bC2cfdnJZXmxzHjilBx7ZzrgJybUOg9U="}},"text":"1.0.1\n07.Sep.2022\nInitial release of the redsigned DHL Parcel DE Retruns API including following changes in compare to the old API:\nNew Services and Functions:\nGet available return locations for your account by using /locations\nInternational returns response including international shipping number\nMajor changes compared to the initial Returns API on entwickler.dhl.de:\nDue to an API modernization and harmonization programm, Post & Parcel APIs becoming more similar to each other.If you implemented the previous parcel returns API, please notice the following changes in the new version here:\nRenaming of business objects\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nsenderAddress \nshipper\npostCode \npostalCode\nstreetName \naddressStreet\nhouseNumber \naddressHouse\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nsenderAddress \nshipper\npostCode \npostalCode\nstreetName \naddressStreet\nhouseNumber \naddressHouse\nRenaming of business objects for international shipment\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\npositionDescription \nitemDescription\ncount \npackagedQuantity\nweightInGrams\nobject: \"itemWeight\": {\"uom\": \"g\",\"value\": 1000}\ncurrency \n\nobject: \"itemValue\": {\"currency\": \"EUR\",\"value\": 100}\nPlease notice, that each item has to have a currency object and all CN23 items should have the same currency\n\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\npositionDescription \nitemDescription\ncount \npackagedQuantity\nweightInGrams\nobject: \"itemWeight\": {\"uom\": \"g\",\"value\": 1000}\ncurrency \n\nobject: \"itemValue\": {\"currency\": \"EUR\",\"value\": 100}\nPlease notice, that each item has to have a currency object and all CN23 items should have the same currency\n\nFollowing parameter are no longer necessary:\noriginalShipmentNumber, originalOperator, acompanyingDocument, originalInvoiceNumber, originalInvoiceDate, comment, originCountry, articleReference, tarifNumber\nChanges in Requests\nreturnDocumentType is not longer in request body, use the URL-Parameter instead: ?labelType=SHIPMENT_LABEL\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nRequest-Body-Parameter:\n\t\t\t\n\"returnDocumentType\": \"BOTH\"\n\n\nURL-Parameter : ?labelType=BOTH\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nRequest-Body-Parameter:\n\t\t\t\n\"returnDocumentType\": \"BOTH\"\n\n\nURL-Parameter : ?labelType=BOTH\nChanges in Responses\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nshipmentNumber\nshipmentNo\n \nResponses including internationalShipmentNo\n \nNew object for response shipment status \"sstatus\" . {\"title\": \"Created\", \"status\": 201, ... }\nlabelData \n\"label\":{\"b64\": \"...\"}\nqrLabelData \n\"qrLabel\":{\"b64\": \"...\"}\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nshipmentNumber\nshipmentNo\n \nResponses including internationalShipmentNo\n \nNew object for response shipment status \"sstatus\" . {\"title\": \"Created\", \"status\": 201, ... }\nlabelData \n\"label\":{\"b64\": \"...\"}\nqrLabelData \n\"qrLabel\":{\"b64\": \"...\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Content\n\n\nSearch\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs of our divisions\n\n\nDHL eCommerce\n\n\nDHL Express\n\n\nDHL Global Forwarding\n\n\nDHL Freight\n\n\nDHL Supply Chain\n\n\nPost & Parcel Germany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n\nAPI Catalog\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nAPI Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nImprint\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nCookie Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              2024  © DHL International GmbH.

An API Productive Key and access details will be provided to You subject to a successful validation of Your credentials by DHL. For the avoidance of doubt, a reference to the DGF Shipment Label API in these Legal Terms is deemed a reference to the DGF Shipment Label API including the API Services (such API Services include the upload and download of documents as set forth herein and in the scope description), unless the context suggests otherwise.\nThe DGF Shipment Label API provides the possibility to generate DHL shipment labels using DHL’s shipment number (e.g. Housebill number and DHL Shipment ID). Please be aware that the generation of the shipment label by use of the DGF Shipment Label API does not constitute the contract of carriage. The contract of carriage will only be concluded when the shipment is handed over or picked up and accepted by DHL.\nIf You engage an external developer, or other IT services provider to develop Your Application or any other third party (“Third Parties”) to access and/or use the DGF Shipment Label API on Your behalf, You remain fully liable for any acts or omissions of such Third Parties in connection with the access to and/or usage of the DGF Shipment Label API.\nThese Legal Terms and the General Developer Portal Terms of Use govern Your use of and/or access to the DGF Shipment Label API and, unless otherwise stated herein, do not replace and/or modify the applicable terms and conditions of carriage; any transportation services agreement; or any other agreements with DHL or any of its affiliates, which govern services or products provided to You (separately, each an “Agreement”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, You expressly acknowledge and agree that solely with respect to Your use of and access to the DGF Shipment Label API the Legal Terms shall take precedence over the terms and conditions in an Agreement, unless an Agreement specifically addresses the use of or access to the DGF Shipment Label API by You, in which case the Agreement shall prevail.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference DocsDHL Global Forwarding Shipment Label API 1.0.1 OAS3Download API SpecServershttps://api-sandbox.dhl.com/dgff/transportation - Sandbox - test environmenthttps://api.dhl.com/dgff/transportation - ProductionAuthorizedefaultEndpoints POST/shipment-labelCreate a shipment label \n\n\n\nRelease Notes\n \n1.0.0\n29.Jul.2021\nSupports Air Freight House waybill label\n\n\n\n \n1.0.1\n16.Nov.2021\nSupports Ocean Freight House waybill label and additional shipment ID as input parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Content\n\n\nSearch\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs of our divisions\n\n\nDHL eCommerce\n\n\nDHL Express\n\n\nDHL Global Forwarding\n\n\nDHL Freight\n\n\nDHL Supply Chain\n\n\nPost & Parcel Germany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n\nAPI Catalog\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nAPI Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nImprint\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nCookie Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              2024  © DHL International GmbH.

Use this service to create any shipping label, so you can rest assured that we’ll deliver all of your shipments. \n \nPrint Labels\nCreate shipping and return labels for all your shipments with the Label Service API. A shipment can consist of several parcels, or you can designate each parcel as a separate shipment. Before creating the label, check whether the selected products are available by using the Capability Service API.\n \nDelivery Times\nLet your customers choose the day and time they want to receive their parcel. Put delivery times in your online store’s check-out to give your customers more options. In order to deliver shipments within the selected time windows, please present them to the DHL driver on the correct day. \n \nPick-ups\nBook pick-ups for your shipments and have them picked up at your convenience. We pick up parcels and pallets in one pick-up. Our standard option is to book pick-up as of the next pick-up day – you can only schedule a pick-up appointment for the same day in Spain and Portugal. If a pick-up is scheduled for the same day, please check availability with an ISO country code and the postal code of the pick-up address.\n \nTrack and Trace\nThe Track and Trace API displays the current status of the delivery. Linking with this API offers you a whole range of options. You can integrate the track and trace component into your own online store, so that your customers return to your website to check the status of their delivery. Based on the delivery status, you can also send useful notifications to your customers, such as when the delivery time has been scheduled.  \n \nUsing the API\nThe DHL Parcel EU (BE  - LU - NL) has been developed for and by developers. You need knowledge of REST APIs, JSON, and HTTPS and a business account in the My DHL Parcel online shipping service.\nLog in to My DHL Parcel in Belgium(link is external), Luxembourg(link is external) or Netherlands(link is external) and go to the “Settings” menu. This is where you can create your API user ID and key and start linking the API right away. Click on the button ‘CREATE API KEY’ in the tab ‘API KEYS’, the user-id and key are generated.\nHold on to this information, since it will only be given out once. When pressing the button again, a new user-id and key will be generated, overwriting and invalidating the previous one.\n\n \nExample Use Cases\nAutomatically more convenience\nLinking to the Label API means labels will automatically roll out of your systems when orders come in. This will save a lot of time in your shipping process and prevent errors due to retyping or data import and export.\n \nAttract more customers with track and trace\nIf you’ve linked our API to your online store, you can utilize even more opportunities during the customer journey – all the way from purchase through to delivery. By offering track and trace in your own online store, your customers will receive automatic notifications and you’ll increase the chance of repeat sales.\n \nServicePoint: a plus point for you\nYour customers will be thrilled to know they can collect their parcel at a DHL ServicePoint, as they won’t have to worry about waiting for the delivery at home. If you’ve added the delivery option to your online store with our API, your customers can arrange everything immediately. Once the parcel has arrived, they’ll be sent a notification.\n \nImprove your customer service with the track and trace API\nThe track and trace API helps your customer service employees by placing up-to-date track and trace details directly in view in your own system. Your agents can inspect the signature for receipt, if available. As they’ll no longer need to consult a separate track-and-trace system, you can considerably reduce the length of calls to Customer Service.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":1922,"endCharIdx":6980,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"U3QVw/5j6gWVoXqKGazPk2TZ48GL3ARgyMZtThKhq4k="},"85e39040-9845-4f1c-b96a-b88bcbb5c0fc":{"id_":"85e39040-9845-4f1c-b96a-b88bcbb5c0fc","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-eu"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ac9dd222-5e81-4a15-9955-d41c4ca27916","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-eu"},"hash":"obgr7Yl2ogcssKo333NfSdY9uj5gHAe9Vq7JduxXhvc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2c0ddcbb-634c-4fec-80e7-e381ed591846","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-eu"},"hash":"SBr3u4S/2t3VuungB5PQ8O5psn7vF5X5taZvyf+tuXM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"30df70b4-894c-4a62-85bb-f37c9bcdd69e","metadata":{},"hash":"d88CjLsFB4Sacl8wikpq3KJwKblf1oczcQWXJBcOybI="}},"text":"User Guide\nGet Access\nTo use the DHL Parcel EU (BE - LU - NL) API, your organization requires to have an active customer account with one of the DHL Parcel countries.\nI already have an account number with one of the DHL Parcel EU countries:\n\n[1.] Sign up for My DHL Parcel\n\n\n[2.] Request API access\n\n\nCreate an account for My DHL Parcel in:\n Belgium(link is external), Luxembourg(link is external) or Netherlands(link is external)\n\n\n\nGet your API credentials under the user account on the My DHL Parcel application page.

the Authenticate API key endpoint.As a response, the endpoint returns both an access token and a refresh token.The access token is valid for a limited time, indicated by the expiration time in the response attribute ‘accessTokenExpiration’.When this time (expressed as a unix time stamp) has expired, the secure access can again be established by obtaining a new access token using the refresh token and the Authenticate refresh token endpoint.Please keep in mind that this refresh token also has an expiration date time, but it is significantly longer than that of the access token.The response of the refresh endpoint is the same as the initial call to the Authenticate API key endpoint; it also results in an access and a refresh token with expiration date times.The resulting access tokens contain some encoded information about your access rights, including a list of account numbers.By default, access tokens give access to all account numbers assigned to your API key user.To limit this list, you may provide the optional accountNumbers field in your authentication request.Example of response body (200) of the /api-key:\n{\n

environments you have to sign up. To sign up, please get in touch with your local sales representative.\nImplement your API solution in our Sandbox environment (see use cases) and seek approval from our DHL experts (for data and label).\nRetrieve access to Production environment and start shipping.\nTo contact your DHL eCommerce team, please use this contact form.\nAuthentication\nTo get access to the API (Sandbox and Production environment), you will receive a Client ID and a password. Please use the contact form (including your company name, industry and contact details (incl. phone number and email address)) to apply for these.\nThe API provides OAuth 2.0 Access Token with various authorization scopes.\nThe \"Get Access Token\" API call provides an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token with authorization scope, assigned to your client id. It grants you an access to the CCC APIs.\nThe API operation is secured by HTTP Basic authentication, therefore you have to provide 'client_id' and 'client_secret' as an username and password, when calling the API. Credentials will be provided to you via secured channel.\nEnvironments\nThe addressable API base URL/URI environments are:\nEnvironment\nDescription\nhttps://api-sandbox.dhl.com\nSandbox environment\nhttps://api.dhl.com\nProduction environment\nEnvironment\nDescription\nhttps://api-sandbox.dhl.com\nSandbox environment\nhttps://api.dhl.com\nProduction environment\nThe Sandbox environment can be used for testing freely. Only the production environment will trigger underlying processes, e.g. billing, operational procedures.\nInformation for Integrators\nThe DHL eConnect API differentiates between customers and integrators. If you are an integrator, you may retrieve permission to operate the API on behalf of an assigned customer. For administrative reasons, shipments are always assigned to a dedicated customer. API users with status \"integrator\" cannot generate shipments themselves, unless they additionally have a customer account.\nThe customer/integrator configuration is performed by DHL, please contact via the contact form.\nRate Limits\nRate limits protect the DHL infrastructure from suspicious requests that exceed defined thresholds.\nShould you exceed your rate limit you will receive a HTTP status code within the API response that will indicate this.\nIn addition to the rate limit a so called \"spike arrest\" protects our API Platform from potential outages caused by a very large volume of requests sent in a short time span (minutes or seconds). This will be indicated by a different HTTP status code.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Ck58qF2TQQU17Ub6j3NoLgs/a+CJfL3CoCGlLDVKfng="},"feaa8506-8d6e-4878-8380-0c3d7fbd11bd":{"id_":"feaa8506-8d6e-4878-8380-0c3d7fbd11bd","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/ecommerce-europe"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"3609d577-13b6-46b5-b033-2a7581cd0b84","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/ecommerce-europe"},"hash":"FbdhkcAoPm9kLHJI4WqLzh5mMWe/SlplXfe6Hy38N50="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"22dee7e8-263e-4ad1-86f1-1ea15dd40216","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/ecommerce-europe"},"hash":"mOlT2Dv5oUVp8jSH0LUSPSOFOz3gJlAZUcGCm44X9fA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d523ca94-518b-4562-a308-0a9589d7e8e2","metadata":{},"hash":"pH+X4UHOhqcHOtqhX6RjgPNKkR047lf+Q8r35bf0gRM="}},"text":"Functionalities\nThis API offers various functionalities that all support you in managing your DHL eCommerce Solutions cross-border parcel shipments.

to the API channel, customers shipments can be monitored as well via public websites, e.g.: www.dhl.com/tracking\nSenders can communicate track & trace information to their recipients via one link for all European destinations.The link gives direct access to tracking information: http://www.dhl.com/tracking?tracking-ID=#### and can be personalized with an individual shipping ID.Customs data\nThe customs functionality of the eConnect API is applicable for the products \"DHL Parcel International\" and \"DHL Parcel Connect\".However, the product \"DHL Parcel Connect\" only supports shipments from or to the United Kingdom via this eConnect API.For parcels into customs destinations, it is mandatory send customs data per each shipment (i.e. cCustoms request) in addition to the shipment data (i.e. cPAN request).The cCustoms call requires information about the content of the parcel (including its value and purpose).It will forward the electronic information to the customs entities (directly or through the customs broker).For customs destinations which require CN23 document, the eConnect API returns this document accordingly to the user on request.The CN23 document is returned together with the shipment label (see explanations on \"Label\" above).It is issued in PDF format for printout and attachment to the parcel.Overview of use cases:\n\tIf you create a shipment to a non-customs destination, you don't need to send a \"cCustoms\" request.If you still send customs data, these will be ignored by the eConnect API.If you create a shipment to a customs destination or region, the \"cCustoms\" request containing the customs data is mandatory.If you don't send it, your shipments will be rejected and you will not receive a shipment label.If either one of CPAN and/or cCustoms is inconsistent, your shipments will be rejected too.Use Cases\nUse Case Overview\nBelow you can find an overview of the different use cases, that are available via the eConnect API.In the

business customer service available here\nIn case of technical questions related to the eConnect API and it's associated services please contact our technical support.\n \nFAQ\nShould we conduct all testing against the sandbox API or are we also able to test towards the production API?\nFirst we kindly ask you to do all testing against the Sandbox, until you have finalized your flow with working requests/replies. Then we will do an approval of label & request data. After that you will receive PROD credentials for real-life shipment tests (e.g. with a couple of customer shipments).\nNote: usually a limited amount of test shipments against the production environment remain without consequence, if there are no scan events performed by DHL and no additional services are requested (e.g. pickup-requests).\nDo you have any Postman collections of the different requests that you could share with us?\nUnfortunately we do not share those at the moment, they are only used internally by our developer team.\nWhich information is mandatory to enter to be able to book a shipment?\nPlease see our request spec for details on each field.\nDo you have package volume and weight validations on your side through the API, or do we need to have all the validations on our side?\nWe have a validation service for several aspects of the shipment, but that is currently inactive for self-labeling customers. Only active for API-label customers.\nWhich package types should be available?\nThe allowed packaging types per product and shipment can be obtained from the product information (see overview section) and need to be obeyed. On the API-call there is no package-type field, so from IT-integration perspective the type of packaging does not have relevance.\nHow do we request the label through the API, do you have any examples?\nThis is part of the GET request, it is defined here.\nIs it possible to send in a parcel ID/parcelIdentifier while also requesting a label, so that the label would contain the customers own parcel ID?\nThis is not supported at the moment. Either you use our API-generated label, which will come with a dedicated number range starting with \"JVGL...\" or you create the label yourself, applying a different number range.\nDo you have any restrictions on which kinds of parcel ID's you are accepting?\nThe following options exist for identifiers:\nASC MH10 in symbology Code 128 barcode, max. 35digits (alphanumeric characters)\nGS1 (former EAN), starting with an FNC1 character in symbology Code GS1 128, 20digits (numerical)\nIt is permitted that the routing barcode is shown in one license plate barcode format (i.e. ASC MH10) while the identifier is shown in another license plate barcode format (i.e. GS1)\n \nFAQ on Service Points\nWhen we request available service points from the API, does the receiving address need to look exactly like in your specification?\nThe minimum requirement is to provide a correct zip code and city.\nHow should the service point be sent in the EDI to you?\nIt is essential to map the retrieved service point addressing information to the correct API fields. Please see our example CPAN for this use case here.\nIs it possible to search by ServicepointID via the API?\nThis search option is not available at the moment.\n \nIntegrators\nAre the API credentials unique to the integrator or to the customer?\nGenerally the credentials are customer-unique.

The customer benefits from these options in several ways:\nSimple exchange of information between the parties involved in the order.\nLean pre-notification and posting process.\nVia an Internet portal (AM.portal), Deutsche Post offers customers the option of tracking their postings from advance notice to posting to successful postal verification at the point of acceptance.\nFor pre-announced orders, invoicing can be done electronically.\nUsing the API\nAM can be used to map all product families of the Post corporate division and all franking types, i.e.:\nDIALOGPOST\nLetter Mail\nPOSTAKTUELL \nPostwurf Special\nPress Distribution products\nProducts international\nAM.exchange\nAM.exchange is the B2B protocol for electronic data exchange between customers, system partners and Deutsche Post.\nAM.portal\nAM.portal is an Internet portal that provides customers and system partners using the AM.exchange protocol with information on orders and order status.\n\nFigure: Overview of data communication between customer and Deutsche Post\n \nBrief overview of AM.exchange protocol\nThe AM.exchange protocol provides a collection of messages, so-called requests and responses, for the exchange of information with the order management system of Deutsche Post AG. The corresponding OrderManagement service is used to exchange order-related information.\nOrder Management Interface \nThe Order Management interface is used to exchange order-related information. The core of this message collection is the message for order creation: service operation createOrder. In addition, further service operations are available: changeOrder (change of an order), cancelOrder (cancellation of an order), seekOrder (search for orders), getOrder (loading of an order) and seekOrderMessage (search for system messages).\nThe following information collection provides IT project managers and software developers with all the important information on the subject of Deutsche Post's AM.exchange protocol. Among other things, it answers the following questions:\nWhat possibilities does the AM.exchange protocol offer?\nWhat do the processes look like in detail?\nWhat data is exchanged?\nWhich technical transmission channels can be used?\nWhich products and franking types are supported?\nWhat testing options are available?\nWho is the contact person for questions about AM.exchange?\nWe have more details for you in the Developer's Guide \nPlease note the following information on the currently valid order management versions:\nThe Developer's Manual in version 5.3.1 contains the specifications changed as of 01/01/2025 with regard to additional Order – Teilleistung Brief as well as  discount - changes for  Dialogpost and is thus applicable for developers who want to implement these specifications.\nThe Developer's Manual in version 5.2.3 contains the specifications valid until 31/12/2024 with regard to additional Order – Teilleistung Brief and is thus applicable for developers who want to implement and productively use these specifications in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nData transmission channels\nDeutsche Post offers its customers two data transmission channels. Each customer can decide which of the following options to use, depending on the technical options available to them and the use case:\nSOAP-Webservice\nCommunication with the AM.Exchange web service with order management runs exclusively on the basis of SOAP via https. This ensures secure, encrypted transmission of data between customers and Deutsche Post. The web service enables synchronous data communication between customers and Deutsche Post, which means that the connection remains established until the request has been answered and the caller can then process the response immediately.\nSecure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)\nThe use of SFTP is very similar to FTP from the user's point of view. However, a significant difference is that with the SFTP protocol the data is encrypted during data transfer by using the SSH protocol. With this type of transfer, communication is asynchronous, i.e. the customer places a file with the response on the SFTP account assigned to him and receives a file with the response in the same account as soon as processing of the request is complete.\n\n\n\n \nSupport / Contact\nDo you have questions about the listed interfaces?

The search takes place over the last 3 months.\nIn order to display the data e. g. for \"Location\" and the adress of the branch/Packstation, the recipient's postal code must be provided. \nIn case of online returns, it is necessary to enter the sender's zip code in order to obtain further information.\nThe response does not contain any data protection-related information about the sender / recipient.\n*) The reference number must be uniquely assigned to a shipment number.\nAccess requirements:\nIn order to be able to use this interface, you need access to DHL shipment tracking. Please contact your DHL sales contact person to obtain a user ID and password.\nNote: For data protection reasons, the user ID and password provided may not be passed on to third parties. Furthermore, restrictions on the query volume and a performance-optimized design of the retrievals must be observed.\nShipment tracking API for business customers (\"business\" query)\nFor individual requests, we recommend that you include the postal code in the request in order to retrieve the maximum shipment  information.\nUp to 20 shipment numbers or reference numbers *) of a DHL business customer can be queried at the same time. It is not possible to specify a postal code for these collective queries.\nThe proof of delivery can be queried via a further request.\n*) The reference number must be able to be clearly assigned to a shipment number.\nAccess requirements:\nIn order to be able to use this interface, you need business customer access. To be activated as a DHL contract customer and to receive a user ID and password for DHL shipment tracking for business customers, please contact your DHL sales contact person.\nNote: Since the call provides sensitive customer data, this information may only be displayed in your internal systems. For data protection reasons, the user ID and the associated password provided may not be passed on to third parties. Furthermore, the limitation of the query volume and a performance-optimized design of the retrievals must be observed.\nIntegration options through HTTP direct access link\nThe HTTP direct call link is a parameterized URL call that displays the search result for a specific shipment directly on www.dhl.de.\nThis direct access link can be used e.g. in a shipping confirmation e-mail received by the recipient to enable direct access to the status of a shipment in the \"Track\" function (DHL shipment tracking). Another possible use is the link to the shipment status from the order overview of the mail order company.\nUp to 15 shipment numbers or reference numbers can be queried at the same time. The search is carried out over a clearly defined period of the past 3 months\nAdvantages of forwarding to DHL Paket shipment tracking:\nDisplay of the current shipment status\nLive tracking display (if available)\nSelection of recipient services such as depositing a specific storage location, delivery to a neighbor, a branch or packing station instead of to the recipient's home address, and changing the delivery date\nContext-related linking to additional help pages and contact option for DHL customer service\n\t \nSince DHL shipment tracking is public information, the display does not provide any information on the sender / recipient that is relevant to data protection. For detailed shipment information on the sender / recipient, the postal code must therefore also be entered.\nExample - integration of a direct access link in an e-mail:\n\nTechnical description of

shipment number range assigned to your business customer account.This ensures that access to the shipment status of third-party shipments is excluded.For calls without a DHL business customer

currently displayed in the DHL public shipment tracking area ( www.dhl.de ).The following special features apply to the \"get-status-for-public-user\" operation:\nThe shipment query is possible via a shipment number or reference.Up to 15 consignment numbers or references can be transferred per call.The individual numbers must be separated from each other by a semicolon.If several consignment numbers or shipment references are included in the query, there will be several elements in the response accordingly.If a shipment cannot be clearly identified (e.g.if a shipment number is not assigned twice within one year), the shipment results are returned in the form of a list.In order to restrict the result set from the outset, the attribute \"zip-code\" should be given when calling.In order to display the data for \"Location\" and the warehouse address of the branch/Packstation, the recipient's postal code must be provided.In case of online returns, the sender's zip code must be provided .Personal data will not be provided.Important instructions:\n\tThe zip code only works when querying the shipment number ( no references)\nThe post code only works with one request for a shipment (collective queries with post code are not possible)\n\t\t \n\nThe number format is checked on the DHL side.If the structure does not correspond to a valid shipment number format, the shipment search for this shipment is aborted.Sample Data\nRequest\nhttps://api-eu.dhl.com/parcel/de/tracking/v0/shipments?xml=\n<data

\"d-get-signature\" function can retrieve the recipient's or substitute recipient's signature.The signatures are also known as POD = Proof of Delivery.Of note here are the following particular features:\nRecipient signatures can only be retrieved via the tracking number.The signature itself is provided in the form of a GIF image format.Since this image format contains binary data and this would cause problems when transferred to XML, the data is converted byte-by-byte into hexadecimal notation.The accesses are typically very resource-intensive.It is advisable to only call up signatures for delivered shipments ( delivery-event-flag = 1 ) with dest-country = DE , since signatures are only available in the system for these shipments.The signatures may only be retrieved once.If you have already retrieved a signature, you should store it in your system for future reference.Please note the regulation of data minimization according to Art.5 Para.1c EU-DSGVO.The recipient's signature may only be downloaded as proof of delivery in disputed cases or if there are legal requirements.Note:To display the signature as an image file, the character string must be converted to the gif image format.In this case, two characters of the image data from the response correspond to a hexadecimal code.For example, a value FF corresponds to 255 decimal, so the ASCII character for code no.255 is the correct interpretation.The transformation of all characters provides the valid image.Sample Data\nRequest\nhttps://api-eu.dhl.com/parcel/de/tracking/v0/shipments?xml=\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"

A check is made here to see whether the shipment is in the customer's number range. If this is not the case, the shipment search is unsuccessful.\nWhy are shipments not marked as delivered after a long time, even though some have definitely been delivered already?\nThese shipments are exclusively international shipments. Depending on the destination country, sometimes a shipment can be in transit for more than 3 weeks. Added to this is the fact that some partner countries do not send us any feedback about the delivery. We are doing our best to gradually improve this exchange of communication, however.\nWhen I submit a DASS query, why do I receive the message \"The request sent by the client was syntactically incorrect ().\"?\nCheck the request again carefully. The cause is usually a small typing error in the request itself. This may be a missing opening quotation mark or an unclosed element. Also check that you are using the right URL for the function call. A distinction is made between business and public.\n\n\n\n \nSupport\nYou can request support in our Help Center.

Updates will be available in UAT first. These updates then also appear with a time lag on PROD. You can see from the release notes of both documentations whether the technical specification for the UAT is more up-to-date than for the PROD.Using the API\nThis API is built conform to the REST architectural style to provide interoperability.Exposed API resources can be manipulated using HTTP methods.Requests to a resource URL generate a response with JSON payload containing detailed information about the requested resource.HTTP response codes are used to indicate API errors.We use a token-based approach to authorize requests coming from your system.Http requests\nApply the standardized HTTP method semantics to communicate with the Print-Mailing Automation API.The API offers clearly identifiable resources (\"things of the Print-Mailing Automation universe\").You can use a resource's representation to create, update, delete and execute resources.There are different types of resources:\nSingle resource: E.g.a systemuser, a campaign and its corresponding properties.A PUT updates properties of an existing single resource identified by an id.List resource: A (pageable) list of single resources e.g.a list of systemusers.Usually, a list resource doesn't include all properties of the single resources.A POST adds a new single resource to a list resource.Processing resource: Triggers a usually long running asynchronous process.This might be a price calculation or a campaign order.A POST is used to trigger processing resources.Lookup resource: Offer permitted (enum) field values for simpler communication with the API.API clients can see which values they can expect and have to include in requests.E.g.values for campaign states (active, paused, …).Usually, lookup resources include an internationalized label.POST requests are used to create single resources on a list resource.The semantic for list endpoints is best described as 'please add the enclosed representation to the list resource identified by the URL'.On a successful POST request, the server will create one or multiple new resources and provide their URLs in the response.Successful POST requests will usually generate 201.PUT requests are used to update an entire resources, which already exists and thus can be clearly identified by an id.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gNYSmU89D16eWgUL5iOhbNQFwPfqIwSbthrRro/xYEE="},"f8be90b7-d48f-4f12-aedd-354e28ba7d67":{"id_":"f8be90b7-d48f-4f12-aedd-354e28ba7d67","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-targeting-api"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"037702ba-a850-4e98-9dd4-c4eac0f7b515","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-targeting-api"},"hash":"q36tDtX5XPWwFe5WZkH2+fEJJSXNGh7N/aFxOkCC8T0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d6c7a1d2-bd66-490c-9105-cf3c5688faff","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-targeting-api"},"hash":"p/vAavAIdRyiK7sUU3Xbi3mgknFkHchgyShNkQvRK0E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"340a3b8d-c859-49cd-98a0-346df1b53584","metadata":{},"hash":"nTKyflvL1+Wnqvg3nbTbCGjrPqCsCbrJ2Vqh3BjXxKA="}},"text":"A

be clearly identified by an id.The semantic is best described as \"please put the enclosed representation at the resource mentioned by the URL, replacing any existing resource\".On successful PUT requests, the server will replace the entire resource addressed by the URL with the representation passed in the payload (subsequent reads will deliver the same payload).Successful PUT requests will usually generate 200.GET, DELETE and OPTIONS requests follow the standardized HTTP method semantics.Headers\nYou can (and sometimes have to) set HTTP headers.This could be the 'Content-Type', 'Accept', 'Accept-Encoding' or 'Authorization' headers, among others.Please only set headers that are necessary.Caution\nBe aware that HTTP headers with empty values are not allowed for security reasons and such requests will be rejected.Payload and media types\nThe standard media type for requests and responses is application/json with default encoding UTF-8.However, other media types like application/xml are supported, too.See the concrete resource definition for all accepted media types.Tip\nSet the header 'Accept: application/json' in your JSON requests in order to get a detailed JSON response in case of an error.Use the same semantics for null and absent properties.OpenApi 3.x allows to mark properties as required and as nullable to specify whether properties may be absent ({}) or null ({\"example\":null}).If a property is defined to be not required and nullable (see 2nd row in Table below), this rule demands that both cases must be handled in the exact same manner by specification.The following table shows all combinations and whether the examples are valid:\nrequired\nnullable\n{}\n{\"example\":null}\ntrue\ntrue\nNo\nYes\nfalse\ntrue\nYes\nYes\ntrue\nfalse\nNo\nNo\nfalse\nfalse\nYes\nNo\nrequired\nnullable\n{}\n{\"example\":null}\ntrue\ntrue\nNo\nYes\nfalse\ntrue\nYes\nYes\ntrue\nfalse\nNo\nNo\nfalse\nfalse\nYes\nNo\nboolean properties must not be null.A boolean is essentially a closed enumeration of two values, true and false.HTTP response compression\nThe Print-Mailing Automation API will compress all text-based responses using your favorite compression algorithm.Tip\nPlease set a correct Accept-Encoding http header for all your request, if applicable!This increases the API user experience and saves bandwidth.Date and time formats\nUse the date and time formats defined by RFC 3339(link is external):\nFor \"date\" use strings matching yyyy-MM-dd, for example: 2026-05-28\nFor \"date-time\" use strings matching yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z', for example 2026-05-28T14:07:17.000Z\nNote that the OpenApi format \"date-time\" corresponds to \"date-time\" in the RFC and \"date\" corresponds to \"full-date\" in RFC.Both are specific profiles, a subset of the international standard ISO 8601.A zone offset must not be used.Date time values are always interpreted in UTC without offsets.Localization of date time should be done by the api client, if necessary.Status codes and common error structures\nApply the standardized HTTP status code semantics to communicate with the Print-Mailing Automation API.The OpenApi specification of every resource provides information about specific success and error responses.It is not a complete list to avoid an overload with common sense information.See below the list of most commonly used status codes in the Print-Mailing Automation API:\nStatus code\nMeaning\n200 OK\nRequest completed successfully.201 Created\nRequest completed successfully.Resource created.400 Bad Request\nInvalid/not parseable JSON payload.Non existing enum value recognized.Concurrent update of a resource.401 Unauthorized\nMissing access token in

resources also include link relation fields for easier pagination:\nself: The hyperlink pointing to the same page.prev: The hyperlink pointing to the previous page.next: The hyperlink pointing to the next page.Lookup resources\nLookup resources offer permitted (enum) field values for simpler communication with the API.There are cases where a API client has to send a specific value from a set of permitted values.If you have a frontend application, these kind of values usually can be picked from a drop down menu.A lookup resource publishes all of this permitted values (which are mostly ids) together with an internationalized label.{\n   \"Font\": [{\n      \"id\": 10,\n      \"label\": \"Arial\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"id\": 11,\n      \"label\": \"Arial Bold\"\n   }, \"....\"]\n}\n\nError code lookup resources\nError code lookup resources offer a complete list of error codes, specific resources may return in an error response.This resource can be helpful during API client development.An error code lookup resource publishes all of this codes with an internationalized label.{\n   \"CommonBusinessError\":[\n      {\n         \"value\":\"DM_CO_0001\",\n

errors.This type of errors is common to all resources.Versioning\nThe API has explicit API versioning within the URL

errors.This type of errors is common to all resources.Versioning\nThe API has explicit API versioning within the URL (/v1/).However, we apply the following rules to evolve the Print-Mailing Automation API in a backward-compatible way to stay on v1 as long as possible:\nAdd only optional, never mandatory fields.Never change the semantic of fields (e.g.changing the semantic from customer-ekp to customer-id, as both are different unique customer keys)\nInput fields may have (complex) constraints being validated via server-side business logic.Never change the validation logic to be more restrictive and make sure that all constraints are clearly defined in description.Support redirection in case an URL has to change 301 (Moved Permanently).API clients should apply the following principles:\nBe conservative with API requests and data passed as input, e.g.avoid to exploit definition deficits like passing megabytes of strings with unspecified maximum length.Be tolerant in processing and reading data of API responses.Be tolerant with unknown fields in the payload, i.e. ignore new fields but do not eliminate them from payload if needed for subsequent PUT requests.Remember, the semantics of PUT.Be prepared that enum return parameter may deliver new values; either be agnostic or provide default behavior for unknown values.Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in endpoint definitions.Note also, that status codes are extensible.Default handling is how you would treat the corresponding 2xx code (see RFC 7231 Section 6(link is external)).Follow the redirect when the server returns HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently).API resources and workflow steps\nThis section walks you through the resources currently available.For all resources where household quantities play a role it is important to distinguish between brutto (gross) and netto quantites.You need the authority POSTAKTUELLANYANDALLHOUSEHOLDS to see brutto quantities.Please contact us if you are eligible of gaining this authority.The brutto quantity is the maximum quantity of reachable households.Retrieving Data for your selection\nVia \"GET\" Endpoints\nThe Targeting API provides multiple ways of retrieving the data you need for your selection via a variety of requests using the HTTP \"GET\" method.For the following example you use the endpoint:\n/postal-code/{postal code}\nwhere {postal code} is replaced by postal code of your choosing.GET

API response includes:\nShipment details\nLatest event & timestamp\nHistorical events & timestamps\nThere are additional fields (masterbill number, operational irregularity and etc.) that will only be visible for Registered Users. To be a Registered User, the requestor should be an existing DGF customer. During the rate limit upgrade process, we will automatically set up customers as a Registered User.\nAPI also allows query using customer's reference, container number or masterbill number. To do that, use GET /housebill-number to get a list of housebill numbers for a given reference, like, customer’s reference, container number or masterbill number. Use the housebill number list returned by the response to perform the next step, GET /shipment-tracking.\nPlease see API specification for more details.\nScope\nThe Shipment Tracking (DHL Global Forwarding) API provides access to tracking services relating to various products at DHL Global Forwarding. \nUsing the API\nYou must have an eligible housebill number (DHL shipment number) for the shipment and an API subscription key (this key needs to be either passed through HTTP request header).\nShipment Tracking (DHL Global Forwarding) - Environment: Production - Rate Limit: Starter API product is auto-approved. It is meant for users with low usage and for users to try out the API without having to wait for approval. Higher rate limit API product (Standard and Internal rate limit) requires approval from DHL team.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":2870,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"uShPWUw0ZRsIqW92digoHR1fzRyNEqrjdiVqQFuEE2k="},"5987bc51-26a4-4b1a-8bfc-988029c6ac7d":{"id_":"5987bc51-26a4-4b1a-8bfc-988029c6ac7d","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/dgf-shipment-tracking"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"9ab4e594-4706-4958-b181-424f794b64a6","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/dgf-shipment-tracking"},"hash":"9fQaLylbeb/0TgYWuPeZ4+OATPs3X4zeRL8cw5PRxoE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a458681c-f135-4f59-98b0-9b0323ad4f7c","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/dgf-shipment-tracking"},"hash":"P7d55aYI4vJP0FfQtKF9ZKtqEogGXCbJ9qtApKcKmiI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d4a46cb7-6934-421d-b50e-0210d5013684","metadata":{},"hash":"HQadvU5zdSi1cWMxQHJ12XN9lj2G5IJpvYJmdBpsH/k="}},"text":"User Guide\nGet Access\nYou must request credentials for any applications you develop\nTo register your app and get your API subscription keys:\nClick My Apps on the portal website.\nClick + Create App.\n\tThe “Create App” form appears.\nComplete the Create App form. \n\tYou can select the APIs you want to access. \nWhen you have completed the form, click the Create App button. \nClick on the name of the newly created App\nClick on the Upgrade Rate Limit button and complete the request form\n\tThe “Approved” label will appear next to the app name when the app has been approved.\n\tNote: Additional verification steps may be required for increasing the Rate Limit.\nAuthentication\nEvery call to the API requires a subscription key.

Tos\nFind DHL locations for delivery in Germany?\nUse Case\nI am a retailer based in Germany. My customers can order my products via my online store. I want to use the Location Finder - Unified API to display DPDHL locations at the check-out of my online store as delivery option. Only those locations should be returned by the API, which can be used for direct addressing. I offer standard delivery (no Express delivery) and both DPDHL stores (servicepoint, post offices and Postbank) and lockers (called DHL Packstation in Germany) are interesting for me.\nSolution\nIn Germany, the business unit within DPDHL to handle this use case is P&P (Post & Parcel), available with this API through the parameter providerType as parcel. The services that offer direct addressing are parcel:pick-up (offered by service points, post offices and postbank) and parcel:pick-up-registered (only offered by lockers). For more information about this business unit and these services, please visit our overviewpage.\nThe parameter serviceType allows me to filter locations by services such as parcel:pick-up and parcel:pick-up-registered. Given this parameter will make the result include only locations with at least all of the serviceTypes requested, and in Germany, locations that offer parcel:pick-up do not offer parcel:pick-up-registered, I need to make two calls to the Location Finder - Unified API.\nRetrieving locations that offer the service parcel:pick-up\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.dhl.com/location-finder/v1/find-by-geo?latitude=50.7169763&longitude=7.1329916&providerType=parcel&serviceType=parcel%3Apick-up&radius=2500&limit=20\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"DHL-API-Key: ****\"\nlatitude and longitude: This is the reference point used to find locations around it. In this case, /find-by-address could have been use as well, although /find-by-geo is more straight forward as /find-by-address simply converts an address to a geo point as a first step.\nproviderType: This parameter with value 'parcel' ensures that only results from P&P (Post & Parcel) will be returned, excluding locations which are not relevant for this case (e.g. DHL Express).\nserviceType: This parameter with value 'parcel:pick-up' ensures that any location which does not offer this service is excluded.\nradius: 2500 meters around the reference point (latitude, longitude) will be considered for the search.\nlimit: If available, up to 20 locations will be returned in the response.\nRetrieving locations that offer the service parcel:pick-up-registered\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.dhl.com/location-finder/v1/find-by-geo?latitude=50.7169763&longitude=7.1329916&providerType=parcel&serviceType=parcel%3Apick-up-registered&radius=2500&limit=20\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"DHL-API-Key: ****\"\nserviceType: This parameter with value 'parcel:pick-up-registered' ensures that any location which does not offer this service is excluded. In this case, all other parameters are the same.\nConsiderations\nIf I would make only one call to the API including the parameter serviceType twice (one per service type), I would have no results as the API would look for locations which offer parcel:pick-up and parcel:pick-up-registered. In Germany there are no locations with that characteristic.\nI will have to concatenate the results of both calls in order to display the complete list of locations for delivery to my customer.\n\n\n\n \nGuide for users of Location Search Europe API\nThis guide is for users of the Location Search Europe API, who want to migrate to the Location Finder - Unified API.\nDPDHL places great emphasis on constantly improving its digital touchpoints from a customer perspective to make them more convenient and easier to use. This includes the decision to consolidate our APIs in a way that allows our customers to get the most value with the least effort.\nWe have therefore decided to transfer the functionalities of the Location Search Europe API, currently published on https://entwickler.dhl.de/(link is external), to the Location Finder - Unified API. This API can be found here https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/location-finder. The Location Search Europe API will be shut down on October 31, 2021.\nYou can find a mapping of the different data fields belonging to the 2 APIs here:\n\n\n\n\nLocation Search Europe API\nLocation Search Europe API Response\nLocation Finder -

The Duty and Tax Calculator API does not provide shipping rates, but instead uses the shipping rate charged to the consignee as an input.\nWorks with\nAny carrier, not just DHL, and have a Worldwide scope (if you are a DHL Express customer, please use the DHL Express - MyDHL API)\nFree 30-day trialGet immediate access and 30 days of free calculations (API calls).\n\n\nRegion: \nGlobal\n\n\nUsed for: \nAdditional Services\n\n\n\n\n \nOverview\nWith this API you can provide and charge your customers an estimated, pre-payable amount for duty and tax charges. Alternatively, you can calculate an amount for informational purposes if you choose not to collect it at time of order completion, so that they know at a minimum how much will be charged upon delivery.\nCollecting the estimated amount ensures a streamlined post-purchase journey. Additionally, local currency is supported for the returned duty & tax estimations should you request a different output currency from the input currency. However, a payment provider of your choice may already be doing this for you (along with your product prices and shipping costs).\nThe correct HS Codes will ensure a more accurate estimation displayed at checkout. You can also manage your own pricing strategy by collecting the maximum, minimum, average at the 6-digit, 4-digit and 2-digit HS code level. Exact pricing strategy is supported, however you must have the full >6-digit code which can differ for each country. Only at the 6-digit level are they standardized across all countries in the World Trade Organization.\nTo sign up and acquire credentials for using the DHL Duty and Tax Calculator API, or to receive more information about our offerings, please check the get access section.\nScope\nThis API offers Duty and Tax Calculation, including foreign exchange conversion where necessary, for shipments from any country and to any country (must be different) in the supported countries list.\nThe following operations are allowed in the DTC API:\nOperation\nType\nPath\nCreate Duty & Tax Quote\nPOST\n/dtc/v1/quotes\nOperation\nType\nPath\nCreate Duty & Tax Quote\nPOST\n/dtc/v1/quotes\nUsing The API\nThe API has been designed for use by developers. You will need basic knowledge of REST APIs, JSON, and HTTPS.\nTo Get Access to the API please verify the different processes in the User Guide section.\nNOTE: We currently have a private plugin(link is external) that supports Duty and Tax Calculation for Shopify.

Postman is a collaboration platform for API development and testing. Post & DHL Germany provides you a comprehensive Postman collection for every single API. You can download the complete API collection, import it into your Postman work space and get started quickly on your integration with our APIs.\nThe following steps must be performed to test the API beforehand:\n\nYou must request access to the sandbox environment to obtain an API key and API Secret\nYou can find detailed instructions on how to do this under Get Access.\n\nSetting up the Postman Test Collection\nDownload the Postman test collection from the download section.\nImport the Postman Test Collection (see official documentation(link is external) of the Postman learning platform)\nReplace the value of the variable client_id and client_secret with your personal API key & secret.\n\nPlease also see our step-by-step instructions on how to use the Postman Test Collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference DocsParcel DE Returns API 1.0.7 OAS3Download API SpecIntroduction\nOverview\nNote:\nThis is the specification of the DP-DHL Group Parcel DE Returns API. This web service allows business customers to create return labels on demand.\nScenarios\nMain Scenario: Creating a returnlabel\nThis is achieved by posting a return order to the URI '/rest/orders'. The service will respond with a return label.\nQuerying to get receiver locations\nThe single scenario supported by this service is the determination of the receiver's location. This is achieved by getting a location to the URI '/rest/locations'. The service will respond with a Receiver.\nTechnical Note on Authorization\nThis API supports two alternative ways to authorize yourself:\n\nCombination of Apikey and Basic Authentication which you can provide with every call.\nOAuth2 Password Flow: After having obtained your access token once, you provide this token as bearer token.\n\nYou can try it out here. More details can be found when clicking on \"Authorize\".Servershttps://api-sandbox.dhl.com/parcel/de/shipping/returns/v1 - Sandbox Environment (Customer Testing)https://api-eu.dhl.com/parcel/de/shipping/returns/v1 - Production EnvironmentGeneralGet API version infoEndpoints GET/Return API version OrdersOrder and retrieve return labelsEndpoints POST/ordersCreate a return label.

Customer reference\nSpecial characters are now allowed in the customer reference field with the exception of pipe (|) and backslash (/).\nThe permitted special characters in the text are also encoded in the barcode. This makes it easier for you to collect returns by scanning the customer reference on the label.\nThe number of characters allowed in the customer reference field has been adjusted to “Mobile Returns” and set to 30 characters. If a longer value is transferred in the request, it is shortened accordingly.\n2. EORI number\nThe \"Economic Operators Registration and Identification\" (EORI) number has been added to return recipients with sender country Switzerland or the United Kingdom in April 2023. The EORI must be specified in the import process for returns. \nThe EORI number field will be expanded to 22 characters so that customers with headquarters abroad can now add the German branch number to the foreign EORI number.\nYou can enter the EORI number for your return recipients with the sender country Switzerland or the United Kingdom by navigating to \"Returns -> Settings\" in the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal and editing the corresponding return recipients there. To do this, click on the \"Pen\" symbol. You must have permission to access the settings. If necessary, contact your company's main user with administration rights in the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal.\n\n\n\n \n1.0.3\n31.Aug.2023\nCorrection of currency list.\n\n\n\n \n1.0.2\n22.Feb.2023\nExtension of the customs content declaration (Commodity) by the two fields:\ncountryOfOrigin: Country where the returned item was produced.\nhsCode: Harmonized System Code aka Customs tariff number.\n\nPrecise definition of error codes in responses based on the JSONStatus.\nFurther examples of using the API\nNote:\nIn April there will be a change in the import handling procedure for goods shipped from the United Kingdom using DHL Retoure International. With effect from April 1, 2023, DHL Retoure International (returns API) will be expanded to include the mandatory fields of the CN23 document for the United Kingdom, as is the case now with Switzerland. Transmission of the required customs information will therefore be mandatory for Switzerland and the United Kingdom in the future.\nWhat this means for you specifically is that with requests for the sending country “United Kingdom” the information for the CN23 document must be included as an obligatory field via the object “customsDetails“. The array “items” in this object must contain at least one goods item. Here we would like to note that the two fields “countryOfOrigin“ and “hsCode“ are optional entries but should nonetheless also be transmitted in order to simplify imports to Germany and avoid possible transit time delays. These two values will also be printed on the CN23 document in future.\nPlease note that due to the Northern Ireland Protocol negotiated between the UK and the European Union, DHL Retoure International is not subject to customs processes or customs registrations for items being returned from Northern Ireland. Effective April 1, 2023, therefore, no data need be transmitted for returns from Northern Ireland, the postal codes for which always begin with “BT”.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":27781,"endCharIdx":31861,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"RibPsbXsCkpAHVNzZ3x07p91uxCnsrRJ58BH3EEx+K8="},"6591a3e7-81c7-4c2a-92e7-0d8e940d89cb":{"id_":"6591a3e7-81c7-4c2a-92e7-0d8e940d89cb","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/dhl-parcel-de-returns-post-parcel-germany"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"db937d08-979c-4a0f-9c3e-12eb63484ffa","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/dhl-parcel-de-returns-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"uSGrwY5ihFezAxhPtFyGzel9X64MOfnLJj9a9fp4VHU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f84e7a4f-0600-42bf-8572-54374b3399c3","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/dhl-parcel-de-returns-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"sLtldUeMzoTyrdeurq+6K3YTXqppkN7w2DFu+Ms/EIo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b8172677-6746-45c5-8985-0af8efcc010a","metadata":{},"hash":"fXCaXsfLHe9bC2cfdnJZXmxzHjilBx7ZzrgJybUOg9U="}},"text":"1.0.1\n07.Sep.2022\nInitial release of the redsigned DHL Parcel DE Retruns API including following changes in compare to the old API:\nNew Services and Functions:\nGet available return locations for your account by using /locations\nInternational returns response including international shipping number\nMajor changes compared to the initial Returns API on entwickler.dhl.de:\nDue to an API modernization and harmonization programm, Post & Parcel APIs becoming more similar to each other.If you implemented the previous parcel returns API, please notice the following changes in the new version here:\nRenaming of business objects\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nsenderAddress \nshipper\npostCode \npostalCode\nstreetName \naddressStreet\nhouseNumber \naddressHouse\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nsenderAddress \nshipper\npostCode \npostalCode\nstreetName \naddressStreet\nhouseNumber \naddressHouse\nRenaming of business objects for international shipment\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\npositionDescription \nitemDescription\ncount \npackagedQuantity\nweightInGrams\nobject: \"itemWeight\": {\"uom\": \"g\",\"value\": 1000}\ncurrency \n\nobject: \"itemValue\": {\"currency\": \"EUR\",\"value\": 100}\nPlease notice, that each item has to have a currency object and all CN23 items should have the same currency\n\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\npositionDescription \nitemDescription\ncount \npackagedQuantity\nweightInGrams\nobject: \"itemWeight\": {\"uom\": \"g\",\"value\": 1000}\ncurrency \n\nobject: \"itemValue\": {\"currency\": \"EUR\",\"value\": 100}\nPlease notice, that each item has to have a currency object and all CN23 items should have the same currency\n\nFollowing parameter are no longer necessary:\noriginalShipmentNumber, originalOperator, acompanyingDocument, originalInvoiceNumber, originalInvoiceDate, comment, originCountry, articleReference, tarifNumber\nChanges in Requests\nreturnDocumentType is not longer in request body, use the URL-Parameter instead: ?labelType=SHIPMENT_LABEL\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nRequest-Body-Parameter:\n\t\t\t\n\"returnDocumentType\": \"BOTH\"\n\n\nURL-Parameter : ?labelType=BOTH\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nRequest-Body-Parameter:\n\t\t\t\n\"returnDocumentType\": \"BOTH\"\n\n\nURL-Parameter : ?labelType=BOTH\nChanges in Responses\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nshipmentNumber\nshipmentNo\n \nResponses including internationalShipmentNo\n \nNew object for response shipment status \"sstatus\" . {\"title\": \"Created\", \"status\": 201, ... }\nlabelData \n\"label\":{\"b64\": \"...\"}\nqrLabelData \n\"qrLabel\":{\"b64\": \"...\"}\nPrevious Parcel Returns API\nNew Parcel Retruns API\nshipmentNumber\nshipmentNo\n \nResponses including internationalShipmentNo\n \nNew object for response shipment status \"sstatus\" . {\"title\": \"Created\", \"status\": 201, ... }\nlabelData \n\"label\":{\"b64\": \"...\"}\nqrLabelData \n\"qrLabel\":{\"b64\": \"...\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Content\n\n\nSearch\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs of our divisions\n\n\nDHL eCommerce\n\n\nDHL Express\n\n\nDHL Global Forwarding\n\n\nDHL Freight\n\n\nDHL Supply Chain\n\n\nPost & Parcel Germany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n\nAPI Catalog\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nAPI Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nImprint\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nCookie Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              2024  © DHL International GmbH.

It is used to obtain an access token for API access. In itself, it does not provide any business functionality but supports multiple APIs of Post & Parcel Germany.\nThe API provides an implementation of an OAuth2.0 resource-owner password credentials flow. Tokens can be used for all P&P APIs supporting the Authentication method. For a list of APIs, see below.\nGet Access\nPlease follow the instructions on the documentation pages of the business API you want to use. The credentials (client_id and client_secret) you have obtained there will allow you to use this functionality as well. You do not need extra credentials for the Authentication API.\nObtaining a token\nThe following curl command illustrates how to obtain a token.\ncurl -k -i -X POST-H \"accept: application/json\" -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' https://api-sandbox.dhl.com/parcel/de/account/auth/ropc/v1/token -d \"grant_type=password\\&username=max.mustermann\\&password=MeinPasswort123#\\&client_id=lr8wTCJjcNnNL9HVYxQYTO6NGqlcGIGg\\&client_secret=hz0ofecvbAaEJxWF\"","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":2935,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wAWz4gYwt2zQ+pm4rhrjdcOLnj75uhO+lUjGwK9x8SE="},"4c46d266-7b87-4f01-ba25-35d216a99bec":{"id_":"4c46d266-7b87-4f01-ba25-35d216a99bec","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/authentication-api-post-parcel-germany"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f4df6e02-6682-444a-a943-ebdab3609d57","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/authentication-api-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"Gy67qzUEFU7EB92Gz2QcuCZrKPSBnC6wWVGtNCrmMaA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"16bd60f2-8600-4425-85e9-728e9e94fcde","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/authentication-api-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"NahIHxk8LBZ2f1StcJV4l4ofAzT32ps9tGGxP9i9zdU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ddcc2e59-d49f-4237-9f3e-0e150baecb0f","metadata":{},"hash":"Joyrw0Kh+VOyMtBCLH2qUQ/18ytcIInqwO1ygoRxpvY="}},"text":"Environments\nThe following table outlines key differences between environments.\nEnvironment\nDescription\nComment\nhttps://api-eu.dhl.com/parcel/de/account/auth/ropc/v1/\nProduction environment\nProduction usage will be approved after successful sandbox usage has been certified by DHL.

This call can even be made from a browser and does not require credentials.\nI requested access and did not hear back for 48 hours or more.\nApologies. Please reach out via contact form. Approval to production is not automatic.\nGo-Live\nWill I use the same key for PROD and SANDBOX?\nIf you have requested access to both sandbox and production products in the same app, the same key will be typically be enabled for both PROD and SANDBOX. We can set you up based on your preferences. We can also add PROD access if you had originally only requested sandbox access.\nToken\nWhat kind of token is that?\nWe provide an opaque access token (example: JU8VQkQaBHnKsphAuGQPKF1VAoBv) to be used as Bearer token in the Header Authorization.\nDo I need anything beyond the access token?\nNo. For business calls you provide simply the access token in the HTTP header. There is no additional credential needed.\nWhere can I find more information?\nThe implementation follows https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749, please refer to the RFC for more detail.\nToken expiration\nThe access token does expire after a relatively short time (e.g., 5 mins). After expiration, you have to request a new token. Please refer to the OAS for details.\nTesting\nHow should I test the hello endpoint?\nThe hello endpoint supports both token based as well as traditional (key + user + password) authentication. It is meant as help during development.","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":2938,"endCharIdx":6841,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"78NfLYALYfhpeBM2K78P8g7Rzhwa2sQD4AnM21FKBTc="},"ddcc2e59-d49f-4237-9f3e-0e150baecb0f":{"id_":"ddcc2e59-d49f-4237-9f3e-0e150baecb0f","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/authentication-api-post-parcel-germany"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f4df6e02-6682-444a-a943-ebdab3609d57","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/authentication-api-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"Gy67qzUEFU7EB92Gz2QcuCZrKPSBnC6wWVGtNCrmMaA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4c46d266-7b87-4f01-ba25-35d216a99bec","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/authentication-api-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"1zbEiwOoH1QqyytPyIfcds1SQOIcFmqNhDWc0E9ukjc="}},"text":"Reference DocsDHL Parcel Germany Account Authorization API 2.0.5 OAS3Download API SpecThis API describes how API client can obtain a token which is used to access various Parcel Germany APIs.\nUsing this API is often the first step in making your API call.\nPreconditions You will need:\n\nclient ID (aka \"API Key\", obtained when you create an app in developer.dhl.com)\nclient secret (obtained when you create an app in developer.dhl.com)\nGKP user name (obtained when setting up your business account with Parcel Germany)\nGKP password (obtained when setting up your business account with Parcel Germany)\n\nTechnical Information\nThis uses an implementation of OAuth2 Password Grant (RFC 6749).

example, to differentiate between locations, clients, or promotions.We recommend that shop software providers and marketplaces set up several fields for entering billing numbers or participations in these cases.If you, as a marketplace or shop software provider, do not want to connect all DHL products and services via the API, we recommend that you also integrate a direct call link to the Post & DHL Business Customer Portal, via which you can call up the \"Pickup\" function.User Guide\nThe following provides an overview on how to get access to the API.If you implemented the previous parcel

Please read before implementing.\nUser role \"system user\" recommended to be used for push subscriptions\nThe API requires to apply credentials of your business customer portal user (GKP Benutzer) for authorization. On our business customer portal you can have multiple users under your customer account which are all allowed to be used for push-service subscriptions. However, we recommend to use a system user for your calls to the tracking push API.\nSystem user's password has to be changed once a year while it expires after 90 days for all other users. \nSystem users cannot log in to the business customer portal as such. But they can use the \"forgot password\" function for recovery in case their password expires: Geschäftskundenportal (dhl.de)(link is external).\nAfter recovery it is necessary to call up the endpoint in order to reactivate the system user.\nPlease note: If the password of a user expires, related subscriptions won't receive any more push notifications.\nUser accounts get locked after 120 days of inactivity\nIn order to avoid that a user gets locked due to inactivity you have to call the API at least every 119 days. Any request to the API which requires user credentials will reset the inactivity timer. We recommend to use a regular call of the API operation \"GET /certificates/default\" for this purpose.\nIn case your user gets locked anyways, please use the \"forgot password\" function on the business customer portal login page to recover: Geschäftskundenportal (dhl.de)(link is external).\nAs soon as a user got locked, it isn't possible to administrate related push subscriptions anymore (e.g. create or delete a subscription) . However, at first we'll continue sending push notifications to the registered endpoint.\nAfter another 185 days (305 days of inactivity in total) the according business customer portal user gets deleted by an automatic process. In consequence the related push subscriptions get deleted  as well and no further push notifications will be send to the push client. In such case you have to create a new system user with your admin user on business customer portal and all push subscriptions for this user must be created afresh.Use Cases\nOverview\nSubscribe to our

\"signature\" to your validation endpoint.Please note:\nPlease keep the subscription ID safe as you might need it for further administration of your push subscription.In case we cannot reach the provided endpoint we will retry delivery of the validation message every 60 minutes up to 24h.Please respond to the request providing the validation url.Otherwise, we'll assume your endpoint isn't reachable.Confirmation of the subscription by calling the validation url is mandatory.We won't provide push notifications until successful validation.In case of no validation within 24h we'll cancel the subscription.In case the validation message doesn't come through unexpectedly you can fetch data on your subscriptions via \"GET /subscriptions\" (see below) and check the provided endpoint for typos or the like.If the URL is faulty, please delete the subscription an create another one by providing the correct endpoint url.Example request to the provided validation url (see the OpenAPI

'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"signature\": \"string\" }'\n\nReceive daily push notifications\nOnce the subscription got validated we'll provide push notifications on a daily basis, starting at 2pm Central European Time.Any status changes that occur after this time will not be sent in the push notifications for the current day, but will be sent the next day.When sending push notifications, there may be a high volume of data.Therefore, it may take some time before your push notifications are sent.Please note:\nAll push notifications get signed by DPDHL.The certificate is meant to verify that the according push message was send by us.The verification by you is optional.Request a certificate using \"GET /certificates/default\"\n\nWe retry to send push notifications in case your client cannot be reached\n\tYour push client application must acknowledge receipt of a push notification message by an http status code 200.In case this doesn't happen, the push service retries delivery for up to 5 days.No retroactive push notifications for newly created subscriptions\n\tOnce you subscribed successfully for push notifications via the tracking push API, we will start caching your shipment data for daily notification.So, even if you subscribe to push notifications before 2pm it might happen that you won't receive shipment data the same day yet if there is no data available for the last processing day.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"QHE4QY8PYZktDqepBYs4EPrYPy1Ar6CQbE84Yu+WaYA="},"d1e4cd1a-0023-4671-b428-2762c9d7154f":{"id_":"d1e4cd1a-0023-4671-b428-2762c9d7154f","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/mail-communication-tracking-push-post-parcel-germany"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"28872e6e-4631-42e1-a6b4-bf1ef17c8e11","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/mail-communication-tracking-push-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"eLqIDejC4Nmo8zy1gMCuHhYhhV0dKBV8kJlAnmlmVeE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c277baee-089c-4893-9bf7-372b8bd57976","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/mail-communication-tracking-push-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"9T+LXJcIw8LJenxL61+FhEiNuA5yM/X0ujLWcUD6YJQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4ab8db6b-decb-4215-b2c9-7e6c517bfa88","metadata":{},"hash":"Hk80ckrgogHzwxxHqHWKOvz2fuSV++/JiSCXbbnQMfY="}},"text":"Therefore,

subscription and create a new one applying the other user and/or new endpoint.Requests to resend a push message (POST /subscriptions/{id}/replay)\nIn case of data loss on your client system you can request the push service to re-send all push notifications delivered on a particular date.Please note, the parameter \"forDate\" has to be provided as POST-Parameter in format yyyy-MM-dd.{\n  \"forDate\": \"2023-03-20\"\n}\nThe data will get resend instantly.Please note that old shipment updates get regularly deleted from our database.Currently you can request to resend push notifications of the past 21 days.Depending on operational needs we might shorten this period in future.Error Handling\nPlease find below an overview of potential error responses and related recommended

processed as part of orders that are identified with a unique order number.Each order contains multiple items.If you use IT franking, the same franking ID can be used several times on different items over extended periods of time.For the above reasons, we assign a unique reference number when your item is first scanned, under which all further events affecting the item will be processed.If franking IDs repeat, the reference number ensures that events are only assigned to the item if they are plausible in terms of aspects such as time.Regarding item information with our Push API or data transfer via SFTP, we will send you information when your item undergoes a status change for which notification is a contractual requirement.A separate data record will be provided for each change of status of an item.The data record contains the current logistical status and always quotes the same reference number, the associated order number and the franking ID.We recommended that you process item status updates using the combination of franking ID (which appears as shipmentID in the data record), order number (orderID) and reference number (referenceID).Data Structure\nThe following table gives an overview on the information provided per shipment within the push notifications.Please note that one push message might contain status events of up to 10.000 shipments.Please note: Due to structural differences between json and xml format, the element names in xml differ slightly from those of the properties in json.The structure of below table follows the json format.However the data

validations\nProvide the callback URL for data delivery if this callback URL is already used for validations\n \nChanged values for export format\nThe possible values for the \"ExportFormat\" field

now     \"application/xml\"\n \nChange when saving subscriptions\nWhen creating or modifying subscriptions via\n   POST /subscriptions\n   PUT /subscriptions/{id}\nin case of success (status 200)\ninstead of the status object sent in the response body (code, message, timestamp)\nnow an object with the input data is returned.\nWhen creating new subscriptions, in addition the generated ID of the subscription is returned.\n \nChange when validating subscriptions\nThe one-time validation for newly created subscriptions changes.\nWith the upcoming release, a separate callback URL for validation can be specified in the subscription (see above)\n \nFor validation, this callback URL is called with a modified record:\nthe attribute name of the URL to be called changes from \"validationUrl\" to \"confirmationURL\".\nthe field \"pushSubscriptionId\" is omitted, it is included in the \"confirmationURL\", and is also supplied when creating subscriptions.\na field

In exchange, you will receive the Access Token required for further requests. Please follow the instructions of the Authentication API (Post & Paket Deutschland) to get an Access Token.\nPlease note: You've been allready granted to use the Authentication API (Post & Parcel Germany) automatically, when you have access to this specific API. There is no further action required on your part.\nSandbox\nYou have the possibility to use our sandbox environment with different functional states of user data:\nUsername: \"user-valid\"\nPassword: \"SandboxPasswort2023!\"\nDescription: Valid Business Customer User\n\nUsername and password can be used in the Authenticatin API to obtain an Access Token.\nThe following curl command illustrates how to obtain a token and use the Postnumbers API:\ncurl -k -i -X POST -H \"accept: application/json\" -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' https://api-sandbox.dhl.com/parcel/de/account/auth/ropc/v1/token -d 'grant_type=password&username=user-valid&password=SandboxPasswort2023!&client_id=lr8wTCJjcNnNL9HVYxQYTO6NGqlcGIGg&client_secret=hz0ofecvbAaEJxWF'\n\nOnce you have valid Access Token you can request the Postnumbers API:\nTry out basic access by querying the API version (without Access Token):\n\ncurl -H \"accept: application/json\" https://api-sandbox.dhl.com/parcel/de/account/postnumbers/v1/\n\nQuery information for a customer (with Access Token):\n\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}\" -H \"accept: application/json\"  https://api-sandbox.dhl.com/parcel/de/account/postnumber/v1/customers/871902603 --data '{\"firstname\" : \"Max\",\"lastname\" : \"Mustermann\"}'\n\nValid Postnumbers in our Sandbox Environment are:\nErika Mustermann with Postnumber 872467133\nMax Mustermann with Postnumber 871902603\n\n\n\n \nPostman Collection\nWe recommend using the Postman software to test our APIs. Postman is a collaboration platform for API development and testing. Post & DHL Germany provides you a comprehensive Postman collection for every single API. You can download the complete API collection, import it into your Postman work space and get started quickly on your integration with our APIs.\nThe following steps must be performed to test the API beforehand:\nYou must request access to the sandbox environment to obtain an API key (client_id) and an API secret (client_secret). You can find detailed instructions on how to do this under Get Access.\nSetting up the Postman Test Collection\nDownload the Postman test collection from the download section. Import the Postman Test Collection (see official documentation(link is external) of the Postman learning platform) Replace the value of the variables API key (client_id) and an API secret (client_secret) with your personal API key values.\nPlease also see our step-by-step instructions on how to use the Postman Test Collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference DocsDHL Parcel DE Postnumber API 1.0.0 OAS3Download API SpecThis is the specification of the DP-DHL Group Parcel DE Postnumber API.

Check if a different first name and/or last name is being used (some people have multiple first names and use them differently).\n•    The customer provided a nickname during registration for a DHL customer account or when entering the address in the validation form, e.g., \"Loki\" instead of \"Hannelore\" or \"Rosi\" instead of \"Roswitha.\"\n•    Check if the first and last names are being used in the correct order.\n•    A title is provided (e.g., Dr., Prof., Graf) that was not provided during registration for a DHL customer account.\n•    The customer has provided only an abbreviation as the first name for addressing purposes (e.g., \"H. Schmidt\").\n•    The customer identified themselves with an ID card for the DHL customer account, and DHL has taken a different official last name than the one used by the customer in daily transactions (e.g., \"Katrin Edle von Giesheim Halbertshausen zu Schreckstein\" uses the name \"Katrin von Giesheim\" in daily transactions).\n•    Name change due to official measures (e.g., marriage, gender reassignment, unreasonable name) that has not been stored or updated in the DHL customer account.\nWhat are the most common reasons for a \"false\" result?\nThe most common reasons are improper use of the customer account (multiple family members using the same account, addressing to a Packstation without being enabled for the service):\n•    The customer tries to use the Packstation account of a roommate/partner, etc., but orders under their own name.\n•    The customer is not (yet) a customer of DHL or has not yet booked the Packstation service. In this case, they still receive a postal code that, for example, serves direct addressing to a branch.\n•    Typo in the postal code.\nWhat business logic does DHL recommend when the API returns \"false\"?\nThis depends on the sensitivity of the shipped goods. For general goods, we recommend using the API only for pre-validation and providing the end customer with a notification that the shipment may not be deliverable.\nIf applicable, offer your customers the option to bypass the validation and set up a warning message. You can also split the string of a name and query them against the API one by one.\nWhy doesn't DHL use \"Fuzzy Logic\" or similar to return \"true\" for names that are likely similar?\nSome of our business customers have strict requirements for recipient identity verification because the delivery must not be delivered to third parties (content sensitive, subject to credit or identity checks). For this reason, we allow business customers to perform a precise validation before shipment and build their own business logic on top of it.\n \n\n\n\n \nSupport\nYou can request support in our Help Center.

More specifically, the covered areas of functionality are:\nItem Master - Also known as an inventory master. The Item Master sends product information from the customer to the warehouse to enable the warehouse to receive deliveries of the product.\nInventory Management - The Inventory Management API provides the customer with the current inventory levels and status to enable inventory reconciliation.\nOutbound Logistics Order - Also known as a sales order, pick ticket or stock transfer order. The Outbound Logistics Order is used as a request from the customer to the warehouse to pick/pack and dispatch goods.\nInbound Logistics Order - Also known as Advance Shipping Notification (ASN), purchase order, goods receipt and return notification or shipment / delivery advice. The Inbound Logistics Order notifies the warehouse that a stock replenishment delivery is scheduled or is on its way to the warehouse.\nReturn Order - The Return Order deals with customer returns/an order that describes inventory that has been returned to the warehouse from a customer\n \nUsing the API\nWMS-specific implementation guidelines are available for each of the warehouse systems that support the Warehouse Management API. Please contact your local/regional DSC Business Unit IT lead at DSC to obtain a copy.\nThe API is accessed as REST API using OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization and JSON format for request and response messages.  The API uses HTTPS (over SSL) protocol. \n \nExample Use Cases\nDHL Supply Chain customers which would like to integrate their systems using standard APIs.\nIf you are not a DHL Supply Chain Customer, contact one of our experts here(link is external).\n\n\n\n \nUser Guide\nGet Access\nTo obtain the credentials please contact your DHL Supply Chain Representative. You will receive separate credentials for the Sandbox and Production environments.\nIf you are not a DHL Supply Chain Customer, please contact one of our experts here(link is

information\nFirst of all it is important to understand the relation between order, shipment, item and content item in our context.Items (or Single Shipment) are the packages, which you want to send to your customer with his address and eventually a S10-Barcode on the item label.The order is some kind of wrapper, where you can add all your items you want to send.After finishing the order creation process, your items will be split into different shipments which can be identified by an Airwaybill (AWB) Number.The AWB Transport document issued by a carrier or a forwarder towards the business customer.The content item is relevant for customs declaration only, where you have to show, which contents are inside of an item (package).Splitting the items into different shipments depends on which combination of product and service level they have.Items with the same product and service level are referred to the same shipment (and AWB Number).Order content relation\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are 3 ways to create an order via our API:\nWorkflow 1 – low flexibilityCreate an order, where you add all items at once\n\tCreate an order where you send all items at once during the create Order API call (Note: orderStatus = FINALIZE).This is recommended, if you know all items you want to ship at once.This workflow does not allow you to delete items from a shipment.Once items are assigned to a shipment, they should be sent out with that particular AWB.Workflow 2 – medium flexibilityCreate an order, where you add items one by one\n\tCreate an order where you add items one by one during the day/your process (Note: orderStatus = OPEN) and finalize the order at the end of the day/your process.This is the recommended way, if you don’t have all information about the items you want to send at once but incoming orders are processed step by step.This workflow allows you to delete or update items from an order/shipment.Workflow 3 – high flexibilityCreate and print labels throughout the day without creating an order\n\tItems are processed and labels are printed individually after creation or in bulk at the end of the day/your process.It is not decided until later, which packages will be sent out at the end of the day/your process.An order is created and the AWB are printed once it is clear which items are going to be shipped.This workflow is recommended for customers and partner platforms seeking full flexibility in the processing of their incoming orders\nWorkflow 1: Create an order, where you add all items at once\nCreate Order (orderStatus = FINALIZE) by requesting CreateOrder, sending all information for items and paperwork at once.The response includes important information about itemIds and AWB Number, which you need in the further process.Get all item labels per AWB by using the AWB Number you got from the first call by requesting Get Item Labels for each AWB Number.Or print labels individually by itemId you received in the createOrder-response.Get all AWB labels for each AWB Number you got from the first call by requesting Get AWB Labels API for each AWB Number.Workflow 2: Create an order, where you add items one by one\nCreate Order (orderStatus = OPEN), sending no extra information about paperwork or items at this point.The response includes information about the order ID, which you’ll need in the further process to add items to this order.(Note: You can open several orders in parallel if suitable differentiated by orderId).Add items to an order by requesting Add Items to an Order.This step can be executed multiple times until all items you want to send are published.Get label for each item you created in step 2 by requesting Get Item Label.Or print all labels per AWB in one call (see step 6).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"u66otho5J1ac4EbmYKv/VbWuBr8BLMnMUQOeIsbgHjg="},"f5ea3dc1-7e60-4402-abad-da6ba51e7331":{"id_":"f5ea3dc1-7e60-4402-abad-da6ba51e7331","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/deutsche-post-international-post-parcel-germany"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"3ceeebc7-e4a1-4a88-b0d1-7a5606101e34","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/deutsche-post-international-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"rhcHR6fYdTH+PI7HZWSi/kcPlVCO+n02DarEv6UrDHg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"51dfadf8-24bd-4269-a61f-d485d76cdaf7","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/deutsche-post-international-post-parcel-germany"},"hash":"KbLJ96hgee1uM7ZQDTeTxJ2+TJP7tU+Tsz8TpLwhzGs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f91fa50a-511c-46ab-98a7-2c00de4f8a9a","metadata":{},"hash":"18UK5k1SvBK/BaIL9R7lMozMIfBCGViFuTnvC5BhaNo="}},"text":"Or

If you have an active account with DHL eCommerce UK please contact your Sales person or Account Manager.\n\tIf you do not have an account please use this web formhttps://www.dhl.com/gb-en/home/our-divisions/parcel/business-users/business-services/sales-enquiry.html\nThe DHL API team are unable to accept direct requests and will contact you directly once your case has been registered\nAt this stage access to the sandbox API's will be provided - you can try and make requests directly from the reference docs section. Read the detailed documentation on how to use APIs.\nUsing the API\nTo get access to the API, you will receive a Client ID and a Client Password; please use the contact form to apply for these.            \nThe API provides OAuth 2.0 Access Token with various authorization scopes. \nThe “Token” API call provides an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token with authorization scope, assigned to your client id. It grants you an access to use the APIs.\nIt is advisable to first use the Reference Data APIs to obtain valid product and shipping combinations. Invalid parcel combinations will not be allowed and will result in an error response. For example it will not be allowed to create an international shipment with a UK domestic service.\nA sound understanding of the Reference Data APIs will accelerate onboarding.\nEnvironments\nThe addressable API base URL/URI environments are:  \nEnvironment\nDescription\nhttps://api-uat.dhl.com\nUAT environment\nhttps://api.dhl.com\nProduction environment\nEnvironment\nDescription\nhttps://api-uat.dhl.com\nUAT environment\nhttps://api.dhl.com\nProduction environment\nThe UAT environment can be used for testing and development freely. Only the production environment will trigger underlying processes such as billing and operational procedures.\n \nRate Limits\nRate limits protect the DHL infrastructure from suspicious requests that exceed defined thresholds.\nShould you exceed your rate limit you will receive a HTTP status code within the API response that will indicate this. \nIn addition to the rate limit a so called “spike arrest” protects our API Platform from potential outages caused by a very large volume of requests sent in a short time span (minutes or seconds). This will be indicated by a different HTTP status code.\n \nShipping Label API\nThis API offers various functionalities that all support you in managing your parcel shipments. You will find a detailed description on how to use these along with snippets in the reference section \nLabels\nThis API can generate labels as a base64 encoded string\nLabels are available for all covered products, i.e. DHL Parcel Connect, DHL Parcel Return Connect and DHL Parcel International, to understand how this works please visit the reference section \nCurrently the following formats and resolutions are available:\n \nPDF\nZPL 203 dpi\n\t\t\t(10 x 15cm)\nPNG 203 dpi\n\t\t\t(10 x 15cm)\nConnect\nP\nP\nP\nReturn\n\t\t\tConnect\nP\nP\nP\nParcel International\nP\nP\nP\n \nPDF\nZPL 203

products based on delivery address and parcel size.\nFind servicepoints in the UK or worldwide.\nCreate new shipments and optionally return labels.\nGet shipment customs documents.\nRequest shipment cancellation.\nRequest shipment amendment.\nRegenerate labels ready for reprinting.\nGet details of customer trading locations.\nRequest a driver pickup from a customer trading location.\nGet information about driver pickups already requested.\nTrack shipments.\nGet DHL eCommerce UK reference data to help you provide valid shipment data from your applications.\nAdd a What 3 Words to a domestic shipment.\nFind a DHL Parcels Depot.\n\nAPI Authentications: All API operations require an access token to be passed in the Authorization Header for each request. The token type is an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token. To get the token you have to call the Authentication operation of this API and provide client_id and client_secret. The Access Token is valid for defined amount of time so it is not necessary to request the token for each request. Developers should implement the client application in a way that the token will be requested again only after it expires.\nAccess Token Lifecycle: When you receive an Access Token, it is valid for 60 minutes. During this time, you don't have to request new token per each request, but you can simply reuse the same token to access API resources, until the token expires. The invalid token or token expiration will be indicated by HTTP Status Code 401 Unauthorized, then your application has to request new Access Token.\nRecommended sequence for creating a shipment with the Shipping Label API is as follows:\n\nUse client_id and client_secret to authenticate and obtain an access token using /auth/v1/accesstoken (see details below). A client_id and client_secret can be obtained by registering on the DHL developer portal and then registering an app in the user dashboard.\nPrepare valid JSON request as per Shipping Label API POST request schema (see examples below). Use data above depending on your use-case.\nSend an API request the correct API endpoint for test/UAT or live/production:\ntest: https://api-uat.dhl.com/parceluk/shipping/v1/label\nlive: https://api.dhl.com/parceluk/shipping/v1/label\nIf the shipment request is valid and accepted then a new shipmentId and optionally labels will be returned in the response.\n\nSample Pickup Accounts And Product codes:\nTo test using the Shipping Label API, you may use the following accounts and additional settings.\n\n\nUK Domestic ShippingCodesComments\n\n\npickupAccountF020579DHL eCommerce UK domestic labels\norderedProduct220Signature At Address Only - Next Day\n\n\n\n\nInternational Road ShippingCodesComments\n\n\npickupAccountF820579DHL eCommerce UK Parcel Connect labels\norderedProduct206Parcel Connect\n\n\n\n\nInternational Air ShippingCodesComments","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"E7DpQJAg1Bhf8zcR+kzyMZjFQC7joq+E/b4eX+rasY4="},"1cd22f54-b353-42fc-a4c8-f28b5d1311fb":{"id_":"1cd22f54-b353-42fc-a4c8-f28b5d1311fb","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-uk"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"c1b8d3e5-ff7f-4cc3-a134-48b77c43e97a","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-uk"},"hash":"lW72bEmyPu4dj0x0NEZGdEuj/EE/iYj0t1FctbIWGfA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d6501471-700a-4a20-a739-b5420230217e","metadata":{"url":"https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/parcel-uk"},"hash":"356Zq9kizLC4aZVUgxnH9wCQpAd732qw9JC6MC4LjXE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a9ffcc23-cc7b-4eae-9641-77175a1fea7c","metadata":{},"hash":"V+f+vAnojXAUnMc/j2W3o/Ag6MfpdzXpugqTKGPcF0s="}},"text":"UK Domestic ShippingCodesComments\n\n\npickupAccountF020579DHL eCommerce UK domestic labels\norderedProduct220Signature At Address Only - Next Day\n\n\n\n\nInternational Road ShippingCodesComments\n\n\npickupAccountF820579DHL eCommerce UK Parcel Connect labels\norderedProduct206Parcel Connect\n\n\n\n\nInternational Air ShippingCodesComments\n\n\npickupAccountF520579DHL eCommerce UK International Labels\norderedProduct101Worldwide Air\n\nServershttps://api-uat.dhl.com/parcelukhttps://api.dhl.com/parcelukAuthorizeAccess TokenEndpoints POST/auth/v1/accesstokenGet Token Product capabilities API V1Endpoints GET/referencedata/v1/productcapabilitiesGet available products ServicepointsEndpoints GET/servicepoint/v1/find-by-addressFind nearest DHL Service Point locations to an addressGET/servicepoint/v1/find-by-geoSearch for DHL Service Point locations by geo coordinatesGET/servicepoint/v1/servicepoints/{id}Retrieve one DHL Service Point location by its ID Shipping Label API V1Endpoints POST/shipping/v1/labelCreate a shipment and optionally a labelPOST/shipping/v1/cancellationRequest shipment cancellation Customs Declaration API V1Endpoints GET/customsdeclaration/v1/documentsGet customs documents for a previously created shipment.
